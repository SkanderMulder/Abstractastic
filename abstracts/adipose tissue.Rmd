Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease caused by a long-term imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. The discovery of three different shades of adipose tissues has implications in terms of understanding the pathogenesis and potential interventions for obesity and its related complications. Fat browning, as well as activation of brown adipocytes and new beige adipocytes differentiated from adipogenic progenitor cells, are emerging as interesting and promising methods to curb obesity because of their unique capacity to upregulate non-shivering thermogenesis. This capacity is due to catabolism of stored energy to generate heat through the best characterized thermogenic effector uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). A variety of phytochemicals have been shown in the literature to contribute to thermogenesis by acting as chemical uncouplers, UCP1 inducers or regulators of fat differentiation and browning. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms and strategies for targeting adipose-mediated thermogenesis and highlight the role of phytochemicals in targeting adipose thermogenesis to fight against obesity. We also discuss proposed targets for how these phytochemical molecules promote BAT activity, WAT browning and beige cell development, thereby offering novel insights into interventional strategies of how phytochemicals may help prevent and manage obesity via adipose thermogenesis.

PURPOSE: Mechanisms related the crosstalk between adipocytes and colon cancer cells are still not clear. We hypothesize that molecules and adipocytokines generated from the adipose tissue of obese individuals accentuate the effect on the metabolic reprogramming in colon cancer cells, i.e. induce disarray in energy metabolism networks of the targeted affected colonic epithelial cells, prompting their malignant phenotype.METHODS: To explore the mechanistic behind this crosstalk we conducted a co-culture model system using human colon cancer cells having different malignant abilities and adipocytes from different depots and subjects.RESULTS: The results demonstrate that co-culturing aggressive colon cancer cells such as HM-7 cells, with Visceral or Subcutaneous adipocytes (VA or SA respectively) from lean/obese subjects significantly up-regulate the secretion of the adipokines IL-8, MCP1, and IL-6 from the adipocytes. Surprisingly, the response of co-culturing HM-7 cells with obese SA was substantially more significant. In addition, these effects were significantly more pronounced when using HM-7 cells as compared to the less malignant HCT116 colon cancer cells. Moreover, the results showed that HM-7 cells, co-cultured with VA or SA from obese subjects, expressed higher levels of fatty acid binding protein 4; thus, the conditioned media obtained from the wells contained HM-7 cells and adipocytes from obese subjects was significantly more efficient in promoting invasion of HM-7 cells.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that interaction between adipocytes and colon cancer cells, especially the highly malignant cells, results in metabolic alterations in colon cancer cells and in highly hypertrophy phenotype which characterized by increasing adipokines secretion from the adipocytes.

AIM: Extracellular ATP signalling is involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes in several tissues, including adipose tissue. Adipocytes have crucial functions in lipid and glucose metabolism and they express purinergic receptors. However, the sources of extracellular ATP in adipose tissue are not well characterized. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism and regulation of ATP release in white adipocytes, and evaluated the role of extracellular ATP as potential autocrine and paracrine signal.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal an insulin-pannexin-1-purinergic signalling cross-talk in adipose tissue and we propose that deregulation of this signalling may contribute to adipose tissue inflammation and type 2 diabetes.

Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) is the loss of limbal stem cells that reside in the corneoscleral junction resulting in vision loss or blindness. Bilateral LSCD is usually treated by allogeneic corneal transplantation, with instances of tissue rejection or failure in long-term follow-up. This study aims to use adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) as an alternative autologous cell source for treating bilateral limbal deficiency conditions. ASCs derived from rabbit fat tissue were differentiated into corneal epithelial lineage using limbal explant condition media. Apart from transdifferentiation, ASC sheets were developed to facilitate effective delivery of these cells to the damage site. A thermoresponsive polymer N-isopropylacrylamide-co-glycidylmethacrylate (NGMA) was synthesized and characterized to demonstrate ASC sheet formation. Transdifferentiated ASCs showed positive expression of corneal epithelial marker CK3/12 on immunostaining, supported by gene expression studies. in vivo studies by transplanting cell sheet in rabbit models of corneal injury showed clear and smooth cornea in comparison to the sham models. Histology revealed a sheet of cells aligned and integrated on to the injured corneal surface, 1<U+2009>month posttransplantation. Identifying ASCs as an alternative cell source along with cell sheet technology will be a novel step in the field of corneal surface therapies.

The extracellular matrix of different mammalian tissues is commonly used as scaffolds in the field of tissue engineering. One of these tissues, which has frequently been studied due to its structural and biological features, is the small intestine submucosal membrane. These research are mainly done on the porcine small intestine. However, a report has recently been published about a scaffold produced from the submucosal layer of the ovine small intestine. In the present study, ovine small intestine submucosal (OSIS) was decellularized in a modified manner and its histological, morphological, and biomechanical properties were studied. Decellularization was performed in two phases: physical and chemical. In this method, a chloroform-methanol mixture, enzymatic digestion, and a constant dose of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used in the least agitation time and its histological property and biocompatibility were evaluated in the presence of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs); furthermore, ADSCs were isolated with a simple method (modified physical washing non-enzymatic isolation). The results were showed that the use of OSIS could be effective and operative. Mechanical properties, histological structure and shape, and glycosaminoglycan content were preserved. In the SDS-treated group, more than 90% of the native cells of tissue were deleted, and also in this group, no toxicity was observed and cell proliferation was supported, compared to the untreated group. Therefore, our results indicate that ADSCs seeded on OSIS scaffold could be used as a new approach in regenerative medicine as hybrid or hydrogel application.

AIMS: Adaptive immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular metabolic disorders (CVMD). The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) are beneficial for cardiovascular health, with potential to improve the dysregulated adaptive immune responses associated with metabolic imbalance. We aimed to explore the mechanisms through which n-3PUFA may alter T cell motility and tissue distribution to promote a less inflammatory environment and improve lymphocyte function in CVMD.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using mass spectrometry lipidomics, cellular, biochemical, and in vivo and ex vivo analyses, we investigated how eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main n-3PUFA, modify the trafficking patterns of activated CD4+ T cells. In mice subjected to allogeneic immunization, a 3-week n-3PUFA-enriched diet reduced the number of effector memory CD4+ T cells found in adipose tissue, and changed the profiles of eicosanoids, octadecanoids, docosanoids, endocannabinoids, 2-monoacylglycerols, N-acyl ethanolamines and ceramides, in plasma, lymphoid organs and fat tissues. These bioactive lipids exhibited differing chemotactic properties when tested in chemotaxis assays with activated CD4+ T cells in vitro. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells treated with EPA and DHA showed a significant reduction in chemokinesis, as assessed by trans-endothelial migration assays, and, when implanted in recipient mice, demonstrated less efficient migration to the inflamed peritoneum. Finally, EPA and DHA treatments reduced the number of polarised CD4+ T cells in vitro, altered the phospholipid composition of membrane microdomains and decreased the activity of small Rho GTPases, Rhoa and Rac1 instrumental in cytoskeletal dynamics.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that EPA and DHA affect the motility of CD4+ T cells and modify their ability to reach target tissues by interfering with the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for cell migration. This can explain, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory effects of n-3PUFA supporting their potential use in interventions aiming to address adipocyte low grade inflammation associated with cardiovascular metabolic disease.

Obesity and periodontitis are among the most common non-communicable diseases, and epidemiological studies report the influence of obesity in the onset and progression of periodontitis. Data indicate that increased body mass index, waist circumference, percentage of subcutaneous body fat, and serum lipid levels are associated with increased risk to develop periodontitis. The underlying biological mechanisms of this association involve adipose tissue-derived cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6, which affect whole-body metabolism and contribute to the development of a low-grade systemic inflammation. Multiple studies report a positive association between these two diseases across diverse populations. Obesity does not appear to impair the success of periodontal therapy. However, currently available evidence is variable and therefore inconclusive. Despite the limited evidence about recommendations on treatment planning, oral healthcare professionals need to be aware of the complexity of obesity to counsel their patients about the importance of maintaining healthy body weight and performing good oral hygiene procedures.

Adipose tissue is a critical regulator of systemic metabolism and normal bodily homeostasis. Recently, the immune system has been implicated in the regulation of adipose tissue homeostasis and function. Here, we highlight new insights into the distinct phenotypes and functions of adipose resident leukocytes, including a growing body of work on their role in adipose tissue remodeling and thermogenesis. We discuss how the protective capacity of the adipose immune system can be diminished during obesity, where immune cells promote sterile inflammation leading to insulin resistance. Understanding the role of adipose immune cells across different physiological states and processes is important in understanding the full breadth of adipose immunity and the possibilities to harness immune cells in fat tissue for the treatment of chronic metabolic conditions, including obesity.

BACKGROUND: Living kidney donors (LKDs) are at high risk of renal dysfunction after undergoing a donor nephrectomy (DN), resulting in poor prognosis associated with the development of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Decreasing this risk can improve the survival rate of LKDs. We investigated the effects of preoperative conditions in LKDs on renal dysfunction after DN using abdominal adipose tissue, inflammation, nutritional status, and muscle mass as markers for this assessment.METHODS: Our retrospective study included 79 LKDs. Body composition markers were assessed using preoperative unenhanced computed tomographic images. Inflammation- and nutritional status-based markers were assessed using preoperative laboratory blood tests. The association between each marker was investigated, and prognostic markers for renal dysfunction after DN were identified.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the preoperative condition of LKDs (assessed using specific markers such as abdominal visceral adipose tissue mass per volume and nutritional status) could affect renal dysfunction after DN. Optimal preoperative management can lead to better outcomes in LKDs. Further research is needed to establish appropriate exercise programs and nutritional interventions.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are considered an important candidate in cell therapy and tissue engineering approaches. The culture of stem cells in a 3D environment is known to better resemble the in vivo situation and to promote therapeutically relevant effects in isolated cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an approach for the direct isolation of MSCs from adipose tissue into a 3D environment, avoiding contact to a 2D plastic surface. Furthermore, the use of a cryoprotective medium for the cryopreservation of whole adipose tissue was evaluated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cryopreservation of fresh adipose tissue with and without a cryoprotective medium was compared with regard to the viability and metabolic activity of cells. After thawing, the tissue was embedded in a novel human platelet lysate-based hydrogel for the isolation of MSCs. The migration, yield, viability, and metabolic activity of cells from the 3D matrix were compared to cells from 2D explant culture. Also, the surface marker profile and differentiation capacity of MSCs from the 3D matrix were evaluated and compared to MSCs from isolation by enzymatic treatment or 2D explant culture.RESULTS: The cryopreservation of whole adipose tissue was found to be feasible, and therefore, adipose tissue can be stored and is available for MSC isolation on demand. Also, we demonstrate the isolation of MSCs from adipose tissue into the 3D matrix. The cells derived from this isolation procedure display a similar phenotype and differentiation capacity like MSCs derived by traditional procedures.CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach allows to cryopreserve adipose tissue. Furthermore, for the first time, MSCs were directly isolated from the tissue into a soft 3D hydrogel environment, avoiding any contact to a 2D plastic culture surface.

BACKGROUND: Thymidine analogues (TA) and didanosine (ddI) are associated with long-lasting adipose tissue redistribution. Adiponectin is a widely used marker of adipocyte activity, and adipose tissue density assessed by CT-scan is associated with adipocyte size and function. We hypothesized that prior exposure to TA and ddI was associated with long-lasting adipose tissue dysfunction in people living with HIV (PLWH). Thus, we tested possible associations between markers of adipose tissue dysfunction (adipose tissue density and adiponectin) and prior exposure to TA and/or ddI, years after treatment discontinuation.METHODS: Eight hundred forty-eight PLWH from the COCOMO study were included and stratified according to prior exposure to TA and/or ddI (with, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>451; without n<U+2009>=<U+2009>397). Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue area and density were determined by single slice abdominal CT-scan at lumbar 4th level. Venous blood was collected and analyzed for adiponectin. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used to test our hypotheses. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, origin, physical activity, BMI, and adipose tissue area (VAT or SAT area, accordingly to the outcome).RESULTS: prior exposure to TA and/or ddI was associated with excess risk of low VAT (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.74 [1.14; 2.67]) and SAT density (aOR 1.74 [1.18; 2.58]), for a given VAT and SAT area, respectively. No association between VAT and SAT density with time since TA and/or ddI discontinuation was found. 10 HU increase in VAT density was associated with higher adiponectin plasma level and this association was not modified by prior exposure to TA and/or ddI. Prior exposure to TA and/or ddI was associated with 9% lower [-<U+2009>17;-2] plasma adiponectin levels and with excess risk of low adiponectin (aOR 1.74 [1.10; 2.76]).CONCLUSIONS: We described low adipose tissue density and impaired adiponectin production to be associated with prior exposure to TA and/or ddI even years after treatment discontinuation and independently of adipose tissue area. These findings suggest that prior TA and ddI exposure may have long-lasting detrimental effects on adipose tissue function and, consequently, on cardiometabolic health in PLWH.

Obesity is a global pandemic and it is well evident that obesity is associated with the development of many disorders including many cancer types. Breast cancer is one of that associated with a high mortality rate. Adipocytes, a major cellular component in adipose tissue, are dysfunctional during obesity and also known to promote breast cancer development both in vitro and in vivo. Dysfunctional adipocytes can release metabolic substrates, adipokines, and cytokines, which promote proliferation, progression, invasion, and migration of breast cancer cells. The secretion of adipocytes can alter gene expression profile, induce inflammation and hypoxia, as well as inhibit apoptosis. It is known that excessive free fatty acids, cholesterol, triglycerides, hormones, leptin, interleukins, and chemokines upregulate breast cancer development. Interestingly, adiponectin is the only adipokine that has anti-tumor properties. Moreover, adipocytes are also related to chemotherapeutic resistance, resulting in the poorer outcome of treatment and advanced stages in breast cancer. Evaluation of the adipocyte secretion levels in the circulation can be useful for prognosis and evaluation of the effectiveness of cancer therapy in the patients. Therefore, understanding about functions of adipocytes as well as obesity in breast cancer may reveal novel targets that support the development of new anti-tumor therapy. In this systemic review, we summarize and update the effects of secreted factors by adipocytes on the regulation of breast cancer in the tumor microenvironment.

Carbon-based nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide (GO) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are currently used in various medical applications due to their positive influence on biocompatibility, adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as their contribution to modulating cell behavior in response to nanomaterial substrates. In this context, in this study, novel flexible membranes based on cellulose acetate (CA) enriched with CNT and GO in different percentages were tested for their versatility to be used as substrates for soft or hard tissue engineering (TE), namely, for their ability to support human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) adhesion during adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation. For this purpose, differentiation markers were assessed both at gene and protein levels, while histological staining was performed to show the evolution of the processes in response to CA-CNT-GO substrates. Micro-CT analysis indicated porous morphologies with open and interconnected voids. A slightly lower total porosity was obtained for the samples filled with the highest amount of GO and CNTs, but thicker walls, larger and more uniform pores were obtained, providing beneficial effects on cell behavior and increased mechanical stability. The addition of 1 wt% GO and CNT to the biocomposites enhanced hASCs adhesion and cytoskeleton formation. The evolution of both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation processes was found to be augmented proportionally to the GO-CNT concentration. In conclusion, CA-CNT-GO biomaterials displayed good properties and versatility as platforms for cell differentiation with potential as future implantable materials in TE applications.

Disturbances in adipose tissue significantly contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, which are connected with hyperglycemia (HG) and underlain by epigenetics-based mechanisms. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on proliferating, differentiating and maturating human visceral pre/adipocytes (HPA-v). Three stages of cell culture were conducted under constant or variable glycemic conditions. Adipogenesis progress was assessed using BODIPY 505/515 staining. Lipid content typical for normal and hyperglycemic conditions of adipocytes was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy and imaging. Expression of adipogenic markers, PPAR<U+03B3> and C/EBPa, was determined at the mRNA and protein levels. We also examined expression of miRNAs proven to target PPAR<U+03B3> (miR-34a-5p) and C/EBPa (miR-137-3p), employing TaqMan Low-Density Arrays (TLDA) cards. Hyperglycemia altered morphology of differentiating HPA-v in relation to normoglycemia by accelerating the formation of lipid droplets and making their numbers and volume increase. Raman results confirmed that the qualitative and quantitative lipid composition under normal and hyperglycemic conditions were different, and that the number of lipid droplets increased in (HG)-treated cells. Expression profiles of both examined genes markedly changed either during adipogenesis under physiological and hyperglycemic conditions, orat particular stages of adipogenesis upon chronic and/or variable glycemia. Expression levels of PPAR<U+03B3> seemed to correspond to some expression changes of miR-34a-5p. miR-137-3p, whose expression was rather stable throughout the culture, did not seem to affect C/EBPa. Our observations revealed that chronic and intermittent hyperglycemia change the morphology of visceral pre/adipocytes during adipogenesis. Moreover, hyperglycemia may utilize miR-34a-5p to induce some expression changes in PPAR<U+03B3>.

Low-grade inflammation is associated with the development of insulin resistance in obese individuals. The present study aims to provide additional evidence strengthening the role of interleukin (IL)-32 in this key process. Using an IL-32 transgenic (IL-32tg) mouse model, we observed that IL-32tg fed a normal diet had greater body weight, due to greater accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) along with larger sized adipocytes. This led to metabolic consequences, with significant higher leptin levels and a trend towards hyperinsulinemia, indicating a phenotype resembling the metabolic syndrome. Adipocytes of IL-32tg mice were more prone to induce a pro-inflammatory response locally, which would be expected when predisposed to insulin resistance and type2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence of a direct contribution of IL-32 to pathophysiological perturbations within the adipose tissue, possibly contributing to the metabolic syndrome that precedes frank insulin resistance and T2D. Future research should focus on the role of IL-32 in the obesity epidemic.

The intramuscular fat (IMF) content affects the tenderness and juiciness of beef and is an important indicator of beef quality. A few miRNAs involved in IMF deposition have been identified in other livestock animals. However, in the buffalo, the association between miRNA and IMF have not been reported and the miRNA expression profile remains poorly understood. In this study, small RNA sequencing was performed to characterize the miRNA expression pattern in muscle and adipose tissues using the Illumina platform. A total of 108 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified, including 98 known miRNAs and 10 novel miRNAs. A qRT-PCR experiment confirmed the quality of the DE analysis. Eight DE miRNAs showed high expression in adipose tissue and a considerable expression level in muscle tissue. Functional enrichment indicated that bta-miR-148a, bta-miR-143, bta-miR-10b, bta-let-7i, bta-let-7f, bta-let-7b, bta-miR-30a-5p, and bta-miR-100 were significantly associated with adipogenesis, suggesting these as candidate regulators for IMF deposition in buffalo. However, further functional validation is required. This is the first characterization of the miRNA expression profile in the muscle and adipose tissues of buffalo. These results provide information for the identification of miRNAs with potential effects on IMF deposition in buffalo.

Various pathophysiological situations of negative energy balance involve the intense depletion of the body's energy reserves. White adipose tissue is a central place to store energy and a major endocrine organ. As a model of choice to better understand how the white adipose tissue dynamically responds to changes in substrate availability, we used the prolonged fasting paradigm, which is characterized by successive periods of stimulated (phase 2) and then reduced (phase 3) lipid mobilization/utilization. Using omics analyses, we report a regulatory transcriptional program in rat epididymal (EPI) adipose tissue favoring lipolysis during phase 2 and repressing it during phase 3. Changes in gene expression levels of lipases, lipid droplet-associated factors, and the proteins involved in cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent regulation of lipolysis are highlighted. The mRNA and circulating levels of adipose-secreted factors were consistent with the repression of insulin signaling during prolonged fasting. Other molecular responses are discussed, including the regulation of leptin and adiponectin levels, the specific changes reflecting an increased fibrinolysis and a possible protein catabolism-related energy saving mechanism in late fasting. Finally, some differences between internal and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues are also reported. These data provide a comprehensive molecular basis of adipose tissue responses when facing a major energetic challenge.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It has been increasingly common to use adipose tissue for regenerative and reconstructive purposes. Applications of autologous fat transfer and different stem cell therapies have significant limitations and adipose tissue engineering may have the potential to be an important strategy in the reconstruction of large tissue defects. A better understanding of adipogenesis will help to develop strategies to make adipose tissue more effective for repairing volumetric defects.RECENT FINDINGS: We provide an overview of the current applications of adipose tissue transfer and cellular therapy methods for soft tissue reconstruction, cellular physiology, and factors influencing adipogenesis, and adipose tissue engineering. Furthermore, we discuss mechanical properties and vascularization strategies of engineered adipose tissue, and its potential applications in the clinical settings.SUMMARY: Autologous fat tissue transfer is the standard of care technique for the majority of surgeons; however, high resorption rates, poor perfusion within a large volume fat graft and widely inconsistent graft survival are the main limitations. Adipose tissue engineering is a promising field to reach the first goal of producing adipose tissue which has more predictable survival and higher graft retention rates. Advancements of scaffold and vascularization strategies will contribute to metabolically and functionally more relevant adipose tissue engineering.

Early skin repigmentation was not uniform and appeared more repigmented than the surrounding normal skin. As time went by, the repigmentation became more obvious and matched the color of the skin around the lesion. Most of the pigmentation presented as a diffuse pattern and was not localized around the hair follicles. Among the 26 patients, 9 (34.6%) achieved excellent repigmentation, while 13 (50.0%) had good, 3 (11.5%) fair and 1 (3.9%) poor repigmentation. During the follow-up visit at 1 year, no excess hair growth was observed in the recipient areas and there was no scarring or ulcer formation in the donor or recipient areas. In the experimental part of the study, many keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts migrated from the adherent outer root sheath. In later subcultures using a specialized medium, pure melanocytes were obtained that had a strong proliferative capacity and had bipolar or poly-dendritic shapes. On the other hand, cells from the dermal papillae grew radially in primary culture and were almost fibroblast-like. However, a few bipolar melanocytes appeared in the later stage of culture.</AbstractText>: Most of the repigmentation in the vitiligo areas appeared within 8 weeks of transplantation of autologous hair follicle cells.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment an axial CT image of the pelvis for body composition measures. We hypothesized that a deep CNN approach would achieve high accuracy when compared to manual segmentations as the reference standard.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We manually segmented 200 axial CT images at the supra-acetabular level in 200 subjects, labeling background, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), muscle, inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT), bone, and miscellaneous intra-pelvic content. The dataset was randomly divided into training (180/200) and test (20/200) datasets. Data augmentation was utilized to enlarge the training dataset and all images underwent preprocessing with histogram equalization. Our model was trained for 50 epochs using the U-Net architecture with batch size of 8, learning rate of 0.0001, Adadelta optimizer and a dropout of 0.20. The Dice (F1) score was used to assess similarity between the manual segmentations and the CNN predicted segmentations.RESULTS: The CNN model with data augmentation of N<U+2009>=<U+2009>3000 achieved accurate segmentation of body composition for all classes. The Dice scores were as follows: background (1.00), miscellaneous intra-pelvic content (0.98), SAT (0.97), muscle (0.95), IMAT (0.91), and bone (0.92). Mean time to automatically segment one CT image was 0.07 s (GPU) and 2.51 s (CPU).CONCLUSIONS: Our CNN-based model enables accurate automated segmentation of multiple tissues on pelvic CT images, with promising implications for body composition studies.

HYPOTHESIS: ATPase copper transporting a (ATP7A), also known as Menkes disease protein, is a P-type ATPase that transports copper across cell membranes. The critical role of ATP7A-mediated copper homeostasis has been well recognised in various organs, such as the intestine, macrophages and the nervous system. However, the importance of adipocyte ATP7A-mediated copper homeostasis on fat metabolism is not well understood. Here, we sought to reveal the contribution of adipose ATP7A to whole-body fat metabolism in mice.METHODS: We generated adipocyte-specific Atp7a-knockout (ASKO) mice using the Cre/loxP system, with Cre expression driven by the adiponectin promoter. ASKO mice and littermate control mice were aged on a chow diet or fed with a high-fat diet (HFD); body weight, fat mass, and glucose and insulin metabolism were analysed. Histological analysis, transmission electron microscopy and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of white adipose tissue (WAT) were used to understand the physiological and molecular changes associated with loss of copper homeostasis in adipocytes.RESULTS: Significantly increased copper concentrations were observed in adipose tissues of ASKO mice compared with control mice. Aged or HFD-fed ASKO mice manifested a lipoatrophic phenotype characterised by a progressive generalised loss of WAT. Dysfunction of adipose tissues in these ASKO mice was confirmed by decreased levels of both serum leptin and adiponectin and increased levels of triacylglycerol and insulin. Systemic metabolism was also impaired in these mice, as evidenced by a pronounced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, we demonstrate a significant induction of lipolysis and DNA-damage signalling pathways in gonadal WAT from aged and HFD-fed ASKO mice. In vitro studies suggest that copper overload is responsible for increased lipolysis and DNA damage.INTERPRETATION: Our results show a previously unappreciated role of adipocyte Atp7a in the regulation of ageing-related metabolic disease and identify new metallophysiologies in whole-body fat metabolism.DATA AVAILABILITY: The datasets generated during the current study are available in the Genome Sequence Archive in BIG Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG), Chinese Academy of Sciences, under accession number CRA001769 ( http://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa ).

Spexin (SPX) is a novel peptide with pleiotropic functions in adipose tissue including energy balance adjustment, fatty acid uptake, and glucose homeostasis. SPX level is closely associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as age, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes; however, its physiological significance in the cardiovascular system remains mostly undefined. We therefore here investigated the roles of SPX in regulating hypoxia-induced alterations in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. We firstly confirmed that SPX is expressed in human and mouse cardiac tissue and documented that exposure to hypoxia in vitro reduces SPX level in rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes and primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). We then treated primary NRVMs with SPX before exposure to hypoxia, which (1) promoted fatty acid metabolism by enhancing expression of FAT/CD36, CPT1, ACADM, and PPAR-a and PGC1-a; (2) did not improve impaired glucose uptake; and (3) significantly prevented the downregulation of TFAM and mitochondrial electron transport chain complex and restrained UCP2 level and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thus enhancing ATP level in cardiomyocytes. In summary, SPX protects energy and mitochondrial homeostasis of cardiomyocytes during hypoxia, thereby highlighting the potential importance of SPX in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Obesity can lead to type 2 diabetes and is an epidemic. A major contributor to its adverse effects is inflammation of the visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Life-long caloric restriction (CR), in contrast, results in extended lifespan, enhanced glucose tolerance/insulin sensitivity, and other favorable phenotypes. The effects of CR following obesity are incompletely established, but studies show multiple benefits. Many leukocyte types, macrophages predominantly, reside in VAT in homeostatic and pathological states. CR following obesity transiently increases VAT macrophage content prior to resolution of inflammation and obesity, suggesting that macrophage content and phenotype play critical roles. Here, we examined the heterogeneity of VAT leukocytes and the effects of obesity and CR. In general, our single-cell RNA-sequencing data demonstrate that macrophages are the most abundant and diverse subpopulation of leukocytes in VAT. Obesity induced significant transcriptional changes in all 15 leukocyte subpopulations, with many genes showing coordinated changes in expression across the leukocyte subpopulations. Additionally, obese VAT displayed expansion of one major macrophage subpopulation, which, in silico, was enriched in lipid binding and metabolic processes. This subpopulation returned from dominance in obesity to lean proportions after only 2 weeks of CR, although the pattern of gene expression overall remained similar. Surprisingly, CR VAT is dominated by a different macrophage subpopulation, which is absent in lean conditions. This subpopulation is enriched in genes related to phagocytosis and we postulate that its function includes clearance of dead cells, as well as excess lipids, contributing to limiting VAT inflammation and restoration of the homeostatic state.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are multipotent stromal cells that provide an abundant source of cells for skin tissue engineering and wound healing. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a concentrate of platelet-rich plasma protein, which contains several different growth factors and other cytokines. In this study, we combined ADSCs with PRP for wound healing. Herein, we found ADSCs in combination with PRP was able to promote wound healing, granulation formation, collagen deposition and re-epithelialization. The mechanism exploration discovered that PRP promoted stress fiber formation in ADSCs, leading to cell migration. Then, we demonstrated that PRP enhanced the expression of Rho GTP family proteins, including Cdc 42, Rac 1 and Rho A. Moreover, it promoted the expression of downstream Rho GTP signaling molecules, including PAK 1, ROCK 2, LIMK 1 and Cofilin. When PRP was used in combination with the Cdc 42 inhibitor ZCL278, the Rho A inhibitor CT04, Rac 1 inhibitor NSC23766, PAK inhibitor FRAX597, or Rock 2 inhibitor Y27632 to treat ADSCs, stress fiber formation was significantly reduced, resulting in decreased cell migration. Our findings may provide a promising approach to promote wound healing.

However, HIIT was more efficient than MICT in the skeletal muscle, whereas MICT was more efficient in epididymal adipose tissue. This suggests that oxidative stress responses to HIIT and MICT are tissue-specific. This could result in ROS generation via different pathways in these tissues.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) assessment is used as an alternative to computed tomography (CT) for research purposes in apparently healthy and clinical populations. It is unknown whether DXA is comparable to CT among cancer survivors, especially in cases where VAT assessment may be affected by treatment history and side effects and become more challenging to assess, such as a history of surgical gastrointestinal resection and/or ascites. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of agreement between DXA and CT when assessing VAT area and volume among cancer survivors. One hundred Gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer survivors underwent abdominal and pelvis CT and whole-body DXA within 48<U+2009>hours. Bland-Altman analysis revealed that in women and men, DXA VAT-area estimates were larger and smaller, respectively, and was consistently smaller in estimates for VAT-volume. Correlations from linear regression analysis revealed statistically significant positive correlations between measurement methods. Overall, while DXA VAT estimates are highly correlated with CT VAT estimates, DXA estimates show substantial bias which indicates the two methods are not interchangeable in this population. Further research is warranted with a larger, more homogeneous sample to develop better estimates of the bias.

A critical step in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases is the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of peripheral tissues. The adhesion receptor, integrin aDß2 promotes the development of atherosclerosis and diabetes by supporting macrophage retention in inflamed tissue. We recently found that the end-product of DHA oxidation, 2-(<U+03C9>-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP), serves as a ligand for aDß2. CEP adduct with ECM is generated during inflammation-mediated lipid peroxidation.  The goal of this project was to identify a specific inhibitor for aDß2-CEP interaction, that can prevent macrophage accumulation.Using a specially designed peptide library, biacore detected protein-protein interaction and adhesion of integrin-transfected HEK293 cells, we identified a sequence (called P5-peptide), which significantly and specifically inhibited aD-CEP binding. In the model of thioglycollate-induced peritoneal inflammation, the injection of cyclic P5 peptide reduced 3-fold the macrophage accumulation in WT mice, but had no effect in aD-deficient mice. The tracking of adoptively transferred, fluorescently-labeled WT and aD-/- monocytes in the model of peritoneal inflammation, and in vitro two-dimensional and three-dimensional migration assays demonstrated that P5 peptide does not affect monocyte transendothelial migration or macrophage efflux from the peritoneal cavity, but regulates macrophage migration through the ECM. Moreover, the injection of P5 peptide into WT mice on a high-fat diet prevents macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue in an aDß2-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of aDß2-mediated macrophage adhesion for the accumulation of infiltrating macrophages in the inflamed ECM and propose P5 peptide as a potential inhibitor of atherogenesis and diabetes.

Recently, muscle has received much attention as an endocrine organ regulating other biological targets, including the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue. Although there is a possibility that muscle-secreting factors biochemically affect bone metabolism in a paracrine manner, the net effects of myokines on the biology of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, particularly on bone mass in vivo, have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we performed in vitro as well as animal experiments using conditioned media (CM) collected from C2C12 myoblast and myotube cultures to better understand the interactions between muscle and bone. Compared with non-CM (i.e., control) and myoblast CM, myotube CM markedly inhibited in vitro bone resorption through the suppression of osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity of individual osteoclasts. Consistently, the expressions of osteoclast differentiation markers, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Trap) and calcitonin receptor (Ctr), decreased with myotube CM. Myotube CM significantly stimulated preosteoblast viability and migration and reduced apoptosis, thereby resulting in an increase in calvaria bone formation. Importantly, systemic treatment with myotube CM for 4 weeks increased bone per tissue volume by 30.7% and 19.6% compared with control and myoblast CM, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that muscle plays beneficial roles in bone health via secretion of anabolic factors, in addition to mechanical stimuli, and importantly indicate that muscle-derived factors can be potential therapeutic targets against metabolic bone diseases.

Oleacein is one of the most abundant polyphenolic compounds of olive oil, which has been shown to play a protective role against several metabolic abnormalities, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Herein, we investigated the effects of oleacein on certain markers of adipogenesis and insulin-resistance in vitro, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in vivo in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. During the differentiation process of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, oleacein strongly inhibited lipid accumulation, and decreased protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), while increasing Adiponectin levels. In vivo, treatment with oleacein of C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed with HFD for 5 and 13 weeks prevented the increase in adipocyte size and reduced the inflammatory infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes in adipose tissue. These effects were accompanied by changes in the expression of adipose tissue-specific regulatory elements such as PPAR<U+03B3>, FAS, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1), and Adiponectin, while the expression of insulin-sensitive muscle/fat glucose transporter Glut-4 was restored in HFD-fed mice treated with oleacein. Collectively, our findings indicate that protection against HFD-induced adiposity by oleacein in mice is mediated by the modulation of regulators of adipogenesis. Protection against HFD-induced obesity is effective in improving peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (Ad-MSCs) have great potential for bone tissue engineering. Cryogels, mimicking the three-dimensional structure of spongy bone, represent ideal carriers for these cells. We developed poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) cryogels, containing hydroxyapatite to mimic inorganic bone matrix. Cryogels were additionally supplemented with different types of proteins, namely collagen (Coll), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), immune cells-conditioned medium (CM), and RGD peptides (RGD). The different protein components did not affect scaffolds' porosity or water-uptake capacity, but altered pore size and stiffness. Stiffness was highest in scaffolds with PRP (82.3 kPa), followed by Coll (55.3 kPa), CM (45.6 kPa), and RGD (32.8 kPa). Scaffolds with PRP, CM, and Coll had the largest pore diameters (~60 µm). Ad-MSCs were osteogenically differentiated on these scaffolds for 14 days. Cell attachment and survival rates were comparable for all four scaffolds. Runx2 and osteocalcin levels only increased in Ad-MSCs on Coll, PRP and CM cryogels. Osterix levels increased slightly in Ad-MSCs differentiated on Coll and PRP cryogels. With differentiation alkaline phosphatase activity decreased under all four conditions. In summary, besides Coll cryogel our PRP cryogel constitutes as an especially suitable carrier for bone tissue engineering. This is of special interest, as this scaffold can be generated with patients' PRP.

Disrupted sleep is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Central actions of orexin, mediated by orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors, play a crucial role in the maintenance of wakefulness; accordingly, excessive activation of the orexin system causes insomnia. Resting-phase administration of dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) has been shown to improve sleep abnormalities and glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetic db/db mice, although the mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, to investigate the presence of functional link between sleep and glucose metabolism, the influences of orexin antagonists with or without sleep-promoting effects were compared on glucose metabolism in diabetic mice. In db/db mice, 2-SORA-MK1064 (an orexin-2 receptor antagonist) and DORA-12 (a DORA) acutely improved non-rapid eye movement sleep, whereas 1-SORA-1 (an orexin-1 receptor antagonist) had no effect. Chronic resting-phase administration of these drugs improved glucose intolerance, without affecting body weight, food intake, locomotor activity, and energy expenditure calculated from O2 consumption and CO2 production. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the liver were reduced by 2-SORA-MK1064 and DORA-12, but not 1-SORA-1, whereas those in the white adipose tissue were reduced by 1-SORA-1 and DORA-12 more efficiently than 2-SORA-MK1064. When administered chronically at awake phase, these drugs caused no effect. In streptozotocin-induced type 1-like diabetic mice, neither abnormality in sleep-wake behavior nor improvement of glucose intolerance by these drugs were observed. These results suggest that both 1-SORA-type (sleep-independent) and 2-SORA-type (possibly sleep-dependent) mechanisms can provide chronotherapeutic effects against type 2 diabetes associated with sleep disturbances in db/db mice.

Chronic stress experienced at work is considered a major health challenge for modern societies. In fact there is ample evidence that deleterious work environments, based on high efforts in relation to few rewards, substantially augment the risk for a number of highly prevalent diseases (e.g. ischemic heart disease, stroke). One potential pathway mediating these associations involves the stress-related activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis with proceeding alterations in the secretion of its main effector hormone cortisol. In this study we assessed a prospective, two-year effect of effort-reward imbalance (ERI) on cortisol secretion, based on a sub sample (N<U+202F>=<U+202F>150; mean<U+202F>±<U+202F>SD age: 42.4<U+202F>±<U+202F>11.1; 84.0% female) of the ongoing Dresden Burnout Study (DBS). The provided ERI measures were collected as part of the online baseline and first follow up assessment. Further, cortisol secretion patterns over prolonged periods of time were evaluated in three consecutive years of laboratory baseline and follow up visits. Our findings suggest prospective associations between ERI and cortisol, indicating a blunted cortisol secretion in response to long-term work stress (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001). Given the regulatory properties of cortisol on various central and peripheral target tissues (e.g. cardiovascular system, liver, adipose tissue), a long-term decrease of cortisol availability can be hypothesized to cause multiple health-challenging consequences. Based on our findings, providing work environments where high efforts are always linked with high rewards have to be considered an important issue for employees health.

BACKGROUND: Olanzapine is a frequently used atypical antipsychotic drug known to exert structural brain alterations in animals. This study investigated whether chronic olanzapine exposure alters regional blood brain perfusion assessed by Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a validated model of olanzapine-induced metabolic disturbances. An effect of acute olanzapine exposure on brain perfusion was also assessed for comparison.METHODS: Adult Sprague-Dawley female rats were treated by intramuscular depot olanzapine injections (100<U+2009>mg/kg every 14 days) or vehicle for 8 weeks. ASL scanning was performed on a 9.4<U+2009>T Bruker BioSpec 94/30USR scanner under isoflurane anesthesia. Serum samples were used to assay leptin and TNF-a level while brains were sliced for histology. Another group received only one non-depot intraperitoneal dose of olanzapine (7<U+2009>mg/kg) during MRI scanning, thus exposing its acute effect on brain perfusion.RESULTS: Both acute and chronic dosing of olanzapine resulted in decreased perfusion in the sensorimotor cortex, while no effect was observed in the piriform cortex or hippocampus. Furthermore, in the chronically treated group decreased cortex volume was observed. Chronic olanzapine dosing led to increased body weight, adipose tissue mass and leptin level, confirming its expected metabolic effects.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates region-specific decreases in blood perfusion associated with olanzapine exposure present already after the first dose. These findings extend our understanding of olanzapine-induced functional and structural brain changes.

The muskox (Ovibos moschatus) is a ruminant highly adapted to arctic conditions. The objective of this work is to study liver, muscle and adipose tissues proteomes in muskoxen highlighting sex differences. Ten animals (5 per sex) were sampled in Western Greenland during the winter hunting season. During carcass processing, muscle, liver and rump fat samples were obtained. Proteomic analyses were conducted using both gel-based and gel-free approaches. Gel-free data are available (ProteomeXchange; PXD014147). For gel-free analysis, 729, 853 and 792 proteins were identified for fat, liver and muscle, respectively. Several proteins were detected with differential abundance between male and female tissues: 77, 15 and 12 proteins using gel-free for adipose tissue, liver and muscle respectively while 3 differential proteins were identified in the gel-based analysis of the adipose tissue. Females have higher abundance of proteins involved in tissue structural stability in the muscle, while males have higher abundance of proteins related to muscle development. In the liver and adipose tissue, females have higher abundance of proteins related to oxidative-stress resistance. Proteins accumulated in the adipose tissue of males highlight higher adipogenic potential. Sex dimorphism is inherent to this species, with higher abundance of proteins in specific metabolic pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: The proteomes of the muskox muscle, hepatic and adipose tissues are characterized for the first time. In addition, the effect of sex on tissue protein abundance is studied. Our results reveal that sex dimorphism goes from morphology to the molecular level in this species, affecting protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. This contributes for an in-depth look into sex dimorphism using proteomics which is lacking in most mammals, apart from model species. Moreover, this information has been related to nutritional status, which is particularly important when managing the muskox population and the transformation of its habitat in relation to external factors such as climate changes that can severely affect ecosystems.

IGF2:g.3072G&gt;A polymorphism has been described as the causal mutation of a maternally imprinted QTL for muscle growth and fat deposition in pigs. The objective of the current work was to study the association between the IGF2:g.3072G&gt;A polymorphism and the IGF2 gene expression and its effect on fatty acid composition in adipose tissue in different pig genetic backgrounds. A cis-eQTL region associated with the IGF2 mRNA expression in adipose tissue was identified in an eGWAS with 355 animals. The IGF2 gene was located in this genomic interval and IGF2g.3072G&gt;A was the most significant SNP, explaining a 25% of the gene expression variance. Significant associations between IGF2:g.3072G&gt;A polymorphism and oleic (C18:1(n-9); p-value = 4.18x10-07), hexadecanoic (C16:1(n-9); p-value = 4.04x10-07), linoleic (C18:2(n-6); p-value = 6.44x10-09), a-linoleic (C18:3(n-3); p-value = 3.30x10-06), arachidonic (C20:4(n-6); p-value = 9.82x10-08) FAs and the MUFA/PUFA ratio (p-value = 2.51x10-9) measured in backfat were identified. Animals carrying the A allele showed an increase in IGF2 gene expression and higher PUFA and lower MUFA content. However, in additional studies was observed that there could be other proximal genetic variants affecting FA composition in adipose tissue. Finally, no differences in the IGF2 gene expression in adipose tissue were found between heterozygous animals classified according to the IGF2:g.3072G&gt;A allele inherited from the father (APGM or AMGP). However, pyrosequencing analysis revealed that there is imprinting of the IGF2 gene in muscle and adipose tissues, with stronger differences among the paternally and maternally inherited alleles in muscle. Our results suggested that IGF2:g.3072G&gt;A polymorphism plays an important role in the regulation of IGF2 gene expression and can be involved in the fatty acid composition in adipose tissue. In both cases, further studies are still needed to deepen the mechanism of regulation of IGF2 gene expression in adipose tissue and the IGF2 role in FA composition.

The effects of maternal conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on embryonic development and hepatic lipid metabolism were investigated in chick embryos. A total of 180 Arbor Acres female broiler breeders (36 wk old) were randomly divided into the following 3 dietary treatment groups: a basic diet (control), a basic diet containing 0.5% CLA (CLA1), and a basic diet containing 1.0% CLA (CLA2). The females were fed for 8 wk, and the eggs from each group were collected and hatched during the last 2 wk. The results showed that the addition of dietary CLA increased the broken egg rate and reduced the fertilization rate and the egg hatchability (P &lt; 0.05). CLA enrichment decreased the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and increased the saturated fatty acids in the yolk sac (P &lt; 0.05). The yolk sac weight, body weight, and body length had a linear decrease with CLA supplementation (P &lt; 0.05). In the developing chick embryo (at E14) and newly hatched chick (D0), the serum triglyceride concentration decreased with maternal CLA supplementation and was accompanied by a reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue deposition. In addition, maternal CLA supplementation mediated the hepatic lipid metabolism by decreasing the mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and increasing the mRNA expression of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase a (AMPKa), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors a (PPARa), liver fatty acid-binding protein, adipose triglyceride lipase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase in embryonic chick livers (P &lt; 0.05). A drop in SREBP-1c protein expression and an increase in the protein expression of p-AMPKa and PPARa were also observed in the liver of chick embryo (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, maternal CLA supplementation regulated the fatty acid composition in the yolk sac, and mediated embryonic chick development and hepatic lipometabolism, and these effects may be related to the AMPK pathway. These findings suggest the potential ability of maternal CLA supplementation to reduce fat deposition in chick embryos.

Mycobacterium leprae infection causes bone lesions and osteoporosis, however, the effect of anti-leprosy drugs on the bone is unknown. We, therefore, set out to address it by investigating osteogenic differentiation from bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchyme stem cells (MSCs). Out of seven anti-leprosy drugs, only clofazimine (CFZ) reduced MSCs viability (IC50 ~1µM) and their osteogenic differentiation but increased adipogenic differentiation on a par with rosiglitazone, and this effect was blocked by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>) antagonist, GW9662. CFZ also decreased osteoblast viability and resulted in impaired bone regeneration in a rat femur osteotomy model at 1/3rd human drug dose owing to increased callus adipogenesis as GW9662 prevented this effect. CFZ treatment decreased BM-MSCs population and homing of MSCs to osteotomy site despite drug levels in BM being much less than it's in vitro IC50 value. In adult rats, CFZ caused osteopenia in long bones marked by suppressed osteoblast function due to enhanced adipogenesis and increased osteoclast functions. A robust increase in marrow adipose tissue (MAT) by CFZ did not alter hematologic parameters but likely reduced BM vascular bed leading to osteonecrosis (ON) characterized by empty osteocyte lacunae. However, CFZ had no effect on visceral fat content and was not associated with any metabolic and hematologic changes. Levels of unsaturated fatty acids in MAT were higher than saturated fatty acids and CFZ further increased the former. From these data, we conclude that CFZ has skeletal toxicity and could be used for creating a rodent ON model devoid of extra-skeletal effects.

Injuries to the skin are common in daily life, and a certain type or size of defect is not easily restored using conventional dressings or naturally. The repair of these defects requires restoration of function in regenerated tissues. In this study, a tissue engineered skin was designed and fabricated using a bio-3D printing system. Polycaprolactone and bacterial cellulose comprised the scaffold, due to their excellent biocompatibility and multifunctionality. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) were seeded onto the scaffold to functionalize it as an artificial skin. The finished artificial skin had mechanical properties similar to that of natural skin, and its fibrous structure providing a unique micro-environment that could regulate the paracrine function of the Ad-MSCs. This effect could be greatly increased by changes in the characteristics of the biomaterials. The artificial skin exhibited high biological activity, strong induction of cell recruitment, migration, growth and up-regulation of gene expression of relevant factors, resulting in excellent wound healing characteristics. This study clarified novel design aspects of cell-material interactions in which the topographical characteristics of materials can be further developed to establish cell signaling or communication networks that take advantage of the paracrine actions of Ad-MSCs to promote specific tissue regeneration or repair characteristics.

The epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) refers to the deposition of adipose tissue fully enclosed by the pericardial sac. EAT has a complex mixture of adipocytes, nervous tissue, as well as inflammatory, stromal and immune cells secreting bioactive molecules. This heterogeneous composition reveals that it is not a simply fat storage depot, but rather a biologically active organ that appears playing a &quot;dichotomous&quot; role, either protective or proinflammatory and proatherogenic. The cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) allows a clear visualization of EAT using a specific pulse sequence called steady-state free precession. When abundant, the EAT assumes a pervasive presence not only covering the entire epicardial surface but also invading spaces that usually are almost virtual and separating walls that usually are so close each other to resemble a single wall. To the best of our knowledge, this aspect of cardiac anatomy has never been described before. In this pictorial review, we therefore focus our attention on certain cardiac areas in which EAT, when abundant, is particularly intrusive. In particular, we describe the presence of EAT into: (a) the interatrial groove, the atrioventricular septum, and the inferior pyramidal space, (b) the left lateral ridge, (c) the atrioventricular grooves, and (d) the transverse pericardial sinus. To confirm the reliability in depicting the EAT distribution, we present CMR images side-by-side with corresponding anatomic specimens.

Obesity is associated with infertility in women through multiple and complex mechanisms. Briefly, the adipose tissue through the production of many factors, such as leptin, free fatty acids (FFA), and cytokines may affect both ovarian and endometrium functions, with a final alteration in oocyte maturation and endometrial epithelium receptivity. In addition, through the development of peripheral insulin resistance obesity produces a condition of functional hyperandrogenism and hyperestrogenism that contribute to produce anovulation and to reduce endometrial receptivity and, therefore participate to cause infertility. Weight loss is able to restore fertility in most cases, but there are no practical indications to guide the clinician to choice the best method among increased physical activity, diet, drugs, and bariatric surgery.

Epidemiological studies reported that vitamin D deficiency represents an increasingly widespread phenomenon in various populations. Vitamin D deficiency is considered a clinical syndrome determined by low circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which is the biologically-inactive intermediate and represents the predominant circulating form. Different mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the association between hypovitaminosis D and obesity, including lower dietary intake of vitamin D, lesser skin exposure to sunlight, due to less outdoor physical activity, decreased intestinal absorption, impaired hydroxylation in adipose tissue and 25(OH)D accumulation in fat. However, several studies speculated that vitamin D deficiency itself could cause obesity or prevent weight loss. The fat-solubility of vitamin D leads to the hypothesis that a sequestration process occurs in body fat depots, resulting in a lower bioavailability in the obese state. After investigating the clinical aspects of vitamin D deficiency and the proposed mechanisms for low 25(OH)D in obesity, in this manuscript we discuss the possible role of vitamin D replacement treatment, with different formulations, to restore normal levels in individuals affected by obesity, and evaluate potential positive effects on obesity itself and its metabolic consequences. Food-based prevention strategies for enhancement of vitamin D status and, therefore, lowering skeletal and extra-skeletal diseases risk have been widely proposed in the past decades; however pharmacological supplementation, namely cholecalciferol and calcifediol, is required in the treatment of vitamin D insufficiency and its comorbidities. In individuals affected by obesity, high doses of vitamin D are required to normalize serum vitamin D levels, but the different liposolubility of different supplements should be taken into account. Although the results are inconsistent, some studies reported that vitamin D supplementation may have some beneficial effects in people with obesity.

Obesity is a multifactorial disease resulting in excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut microbiota as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut microbiota is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut microbiota could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; (b) increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system. Fecal transplantation studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut microbiota in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Diet +/- bariatric surgery have been reported to modulate the gut microbiota, leading to lean host phenotype body composition. This review aims to report clinical evidence for a link of the gut microbiota with human obesity and obesity-related diseases, to provide molecular insights into these associations, and to address the effect of diet and bariatric surgery on the gut microbiota, including colonic microbiota, as a potential mechanism for promoting weight loss.

BACKGROUND: The adipose afferent reflex (AAR), a sympatho-excitatory reflex, can promote the elevation of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and blood pressure (BP). Inflammation in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) involves sympathetic abnormality in some cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. This study was designed to explore the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) in the PVN on the AAR and SNA in rats with obesity-related hypertension (OH) induced by a high-fat diet for 12 weeks.METHODS: Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were continuously recorded in anesthetized rats, and their responses to capsaicin (CAP) stimulation of the right inguinal white adipose tissue were used to evaluate the AAR.RESULTS: Compared to the control rats, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma norepinephrine (NE, indicating SNA) and TNFa levels, TNFa mRNA and protein levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and NADPH oxidase activity in the PVN were significantly elevated in rats with OH. TNFa in the PVN markedly enhanced sympathoexcitation and AAR. Moreover, the enhancement of AAR caused by TNFa can be significantly strengthened by the pretreatment of diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC), a superoxide dismutase inhibitor, but attenuated by TNF-a receptor antagonist R-7050, superoxide scavenger PEG-SOD and NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (Apo) in rats with OH. Acute microinjection of TNF-a into the PVN significantly increased the activity of NADPH oxidase and ROS levels in rats with OH, which were effectively blocked by R-7050. Furthermore, our results also showed that the increased levels of ROS, TNFa and NADPH oxidase subunits mRNA and protein in the PVN of rats with OH were significantly reversed by pentoxifylline (PTX, 30 mg/kg daily ip; in 10% ethanol) application, a cytokine blocker, for a period of 5 weeks. PTX administration also significantly decreased SBP, AAR and plasma NE levels in rats with OH.CONCLUSIONS: TNFa in the PVN modulates AAR and contributes to sympathoexcitation in OH possibly through NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS generation. TNFa blockade attenuates AAR and sympathoexcitation that unveils TNFa in the PVN may be a possible therapeutic target for the intervention of OH.

Cachexia is a wasting syndrome characterized by pronounced skeletal muscle loss. In cancer, cachexia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and decreased treatment tolerance. Although advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms of cachexia, translating these advances to the clinic has been challenging. One reason for this shortcoming may be the current animal models, which fail to fully recapitulate the etiology of human cancer-induced tissue wasting. Because pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) presents with a high incidence of cachexia, we engineered a mouse model of PDA that we named KPP. KPP mice, similar to PDA patients, progressively lose skeletal and adipose mass as a consequence of their tumors. In addition, KPP muscles exhibit a similar gene ontology as cachectic patients. We envision that the KPP model will be a useful resource for advancing our mechanistic understanding and ability to treat cancer cachexia.

OBJECTIVES: The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is considered as a promising therapeutic target for obesity. APPL1 (Adaptor protein containing the Pleckstrin homology domain, Phosphotyrosine binding domain and Leucine zipper motif) is an intracellular adaptor protein and its genetic variation is correlated with BMI and body fat distribution in diabetic patients. However, little is known about the roles of APPL1 in BAT thermogenesis.METHODS: In this study, adipose tissue specific knockout (ASKO) mice were generated to evaluate APPL1's role in BAT thermogenesis in vivo, and possible signaling pathways were further explored in cultured brown adipocytes.RESULTS: After high fat diet challenge, APPL1 ASKO mice developed more severe obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared with control mice. Metabolic cage study showed that APPL1 deficiency impaired energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis in ASKO mice. PET-CT analysis showed decreased standardized uptake value (SUV) in the inter-scapular region which indicated impaired BAT activity in ASKO mice. Further study showed deletion of APPL1 attenuated brown fat specific gene expression, such as UCP1 and PGC1a in both BAT and brown adipocytes. In cultured brown adipocytes, upon cAMP stimulation, APPL1 shuttled from cytosol to nuclei. Co-IP and ChIP study showed that APPL1 could directly interact with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to mediate chromatin remodeling and UCP1 gene expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated the essential role of APPL1 in regulating brown adipocytes thermogenesis via interaction with HDAC3, which may have potential therapeutic implications for treatment of obesity.

Obesity is a complex disease and a major public health epidemic. Chronic, low-grade inflammation is a common underlying feature of obesity and associated metabolic diseases; adipose tissue is a major contributor to this systemic inflammation. Evidence shows that obesity-associated inflammation may originate from gut dysfunction, including changes in intestinal bacteria or microbiome profiles. Increasingly, food and plant bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have been proposed to ameliorate obesity-associated inflammation. Among these, we are interested in the health-promoting effects of anthocyanin-rich foods. Specifically, this review summarizes the reported benefits of anthocyanins in obesity-associated inflammation, and underlying molecular mechanisms, including the role of gut microbiome and cell signaling pathways regulated by anthocyanins both in vivo and in vitro.

Prolonging the ovarian lifespan is attractive and challenging. An optimal clinical strategy must be safe, long-acting, simple, and economical. Allotransplantation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is most abundant and robust in infants, has been utilized to treat various mouse models of human disease. Could we use BAT to prolong the ovarian lifespan of aging mice? Could we try BAT xenotransplantation to alleviate the clinical need for allogeneic BAT due to the lack of voluntary infant donors? In the current study, we found that a single rat-to-mouse (RTM) BAT xenotransplantation did not cause systemic immune rejection but did significantly increase the fertility of mice and was effective for more than 5 months (equivalent to 10 years in humans). Next, we did a series of analysis including follicle counting; AMH level; estrous cycle; mTOR activity; GDF9, BMP15, LHR, Sirt1, and Cyp19a level; ROS and annexin V level; IL6 and adiponectin level; biochemical blood indices; body temperature; transcriptome; and DNA methylation studies. From these, we proposed that rat BAT xenotransplantation rescued multiple indices indicative of follicle and oocyte quality; rat BAT also improved the metabolism and general health of the aging mice; and transcriptional and epigenetic (DNA methylation) improvement in F0 mice could benefit F1 mice; and multiple KEGG pathways and GO classified biological processes the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or differentially methylated regions (DMRs) involved were identical between F0 and F1. This study could be a helpful reference for clinical BAT xenotransplantation from close human relatives to the woman.

HYPOTHESIS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is frequently associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Progression of NAFLD is mediated, among other things, by activation of inflammatory pathways. In the present study, the role of the proinflammatory cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14) was explored in NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus in mice deficient for the cytokine.INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that Light deficiency in HFHCD improves hepatic glucose tolerance, and reduces hepatic inflammation and NAFL. This is accompanied by decreased systemic inflammation and adipose tissue cytokine secretion and by changes in the expression of key genes such as Klf6 and Tlr4 involved in NAFLD. These results suggest that therapies to block LIGHT-dependent signalling might be useful to restore hepatic homeostasis and to restrain NAFLD.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of organic pollutants that have been widely found in the environment. The chemical 2,3',4,4'5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118) is an important dioxin-like PCB compound with strong toxicity. PCB118 can accumulate in adipose tissue, serum and milk in mammals, and it is highly enriched in the follicular fluid. In this study, pregnant mice were exposed to 0, 20 and 100 µg/kg/day of PCB118 during pregnancy at the fetal primordial germ cell migration stage. The methylation patterns of the imprinted genes H19, Snrpn, Peg3 and Igf2r as well as the expression levels of Dnmt1, 3a, 3b and 3l, Uhrf1, Tet2 and Tet3 in fully grown germinal vesicle oocytes were measured in offspring. The rates of in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization, oocyte spindle and chromosomal abnormalities were also calculated. The results showed that prenatal exposure to PCB118 altered the DNA methylation status of differentially methylated regions in some imprinted genes, and the expression levels of Dnmt1, 3a, and 3l, Uhrf1 and Tet3 were also changed. In addition, PCB118 disturbed the maturation process of progeny mouse oocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, attention should be paid to the potential impacts of PCB118-contaminated dietary intake during pregnancy on the offspring's reproductive health.

Low-grade inflammation is the hallmark of metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are characterized by alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition and its metabolites, which translocate from the gut across a disrupted intestinal barrier to affect various metabolic organs, such as the liver and adipose tissue, thereby contributing to metabolic inflammation. Here, we discuss some of the recently identified mechanisms that showcase the role of the intestinal microbiota and barrier dysfunction in metabolic inflammation. We propose a concept by which the gut microbiota fuels metabolic inflammation and dysregulation.

Tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP or NFAT5) is a regulator of cellular adaptation to hypertonicity, macrophage activation and T-cell development. Here we report that TonEBP is an epigenetic regulator of thermogenesis and obesity. In mouse subcutaneous adipocytes, TonEBP expression increases<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>50-fold in response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Mice with TonEBP haplo-deficiency or adipocyte-specific TonEBP deficiency are resistant to HFD-induced obesity and metabolic defects (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia). They also display increased oxygen consumption, resistance to hypothermia, and beiging of subcutaneous fat tissues. TonEBP suppresses the promoter of ß3-adrenoreceptor gene, a critical regulator of lipolysis and thermogenesis, in ex vivo and cultured adipocytes. This involves recruitment of DNMT1 DNA methylase and methylation of the promoter. In human subcutaneous adipocytes TonEBP expression displays a correlation with body mass index but an inverse correlation with ß3-adrenoreceptor expression. Thus, TonEBP is an attractive therapeutic target for obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia.

BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is a famous traditional medicine in China, but the complications caused by broken acupuncture needles have been rarely reported. It seems easy to remove the foreign matters usually, but things become difficulty in special issues. Here, we reported a recently encountered case to provide an important teaching point of treating a chronically retained broken needle in retroperitoneum.CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old man presented with a chronically retained broken needle in his body after acupuncture therapy two years ago. However, due to the discomfort at the left back recently and ordinary inconvenience such as security check, he came to our hospital for minimally invasive surgery. He was introduced to our department because the broken needle had migrated from subcutaneous to adipose tissue in retroperitoneum during the two years. Considering the position of the broken needle, the patient was performed by laparoscopy in general anesthesia. The operation time was about 31<U+2009>min and there were only three 7<U+2009>mm incisions in the left lateral abdominal wall. The X-ray exam was performed to confirm that the broken needle was removed integrally. The patients begun normal activity at 6<U+2009>h after surgery and was discharged on the second day after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is widely used for pain treatment in China, but how to handle the complication of acupuncture needle broken in body are rarely reported. Laparoscopy will be the reasonable choice for treating needles broken in retroperitoneum.

BACKGROUND: The Chinese believe that the meat of pigs reared in the past with free range tastes better than that of the pigs reared indoor on a large scale today. Gastrointestinal microflora is closely associated with the main factor of meat flavour, including fibre characteristics and lipid metabolism. Our method in this study involved different raising patterns within the semi free-grazing farm (FF) or indoor feeding farm (DF), the measurement of fat deposition and myofiber type by paraffin section and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the identification of microbiome and functional capacities associated with meat quality through metagenomic sequencing.RESULTS: Results showed that the fat area in muscle and adipose tissue and the myofiber density significantly increased in the pigs of the FF group. The relative abundance of bacteria associated with lipid metabolism, such as g_Oscillibacter, in the feces of the FF group was higher than that in DF group, and the relative abundance of some bacteria with probiotic function, including g_Lactobacillus and g_Clostridium, was lower than that in DF group. The abundance of g_Clostridium was significantly positively correlated with the intramuscular fat area, whereas health-related bacteria, such as g_Butyricicoccus, g_Eubacterium, g_Phascolarctobacterium and g_Oribacterium, was significantly negatively correlated with abdominal fat area, myofiber density and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) mRNA expression. KEGG analysis showed that pigs raised in semi free-grazing farm can activate the pathway of inosine monophosphate (IMP) biosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: Free range feeding improves meat quality by changing the fibre type, myofiber density and metabolic pathways related to flavour amino acids, IMP or glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in muscle. However, prolonged feeding cycle increases fat deposition and associated microbial communities.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) emerged as a promising therapeutic tool targeting a variety of inflammatory disorders due to their multiple remarkable properties, such as superior immunomodulatory function and tissue-regenerative capacity. Although bone marrow (BM) is a dominant source for adult MSCs, increasing evidence suggests that adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs), which can be easily obtained at a relatively high yield, have potent therapeutic advantages comparable with BM-MSCs. Despite its outstanding benefits in pre-clinical settings, the practical efficacy of ASCs remains controversial since clinical trials with ASC application often resulted in unsatisfactory outcomes. To overcome this challenge, scientists established several strategies to generate highly functional ASCs beyond the naïve cells, including (1) pre-conditioning of ASCs with various stimulants such as inflammatory agents, (2) genetic manipulation of ASCs and (3) modification of culture conditions with three-dimensional (3D) aggregate formation and hypoxic culture. Also, exosomes and other extracellular vesicles secreted from ASCs can be applied directly to recapitulate the beneficial performance of ASCs. This review summarizes the current strategies to improve the therapeutic features of ASCs for successful clinical implementation.

Obesity and adipocyte malfunction are related to and arise as consequences of disturbances in signaling pathways. Tyrosine kinase substrate with four Src homology 3 domains (Tks4) is a scaffold protein that establishes a platform for signaling cascade molecules during podosome formation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Several lines of evidence have also suggested that Tks4 has a role in adipocyte biology; however, its roles in the various types of adipocytes at the cellular level and in transcriptional regulation have not been studied. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tks4 functions as an organizing molecule in signaling networks that regulate adipocyte homeostasis. Our aims were to study the white and brown adipose depots of Tks4 knockout (KO) mice using immunohistology and western blotting and to analyze gene expression changes regulated by the white, brown, and beige adipocyte-related transcription factors via a PCR array. Based on morphological differences in the Tks4-KO adipocytes and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of Tks4-KO mice, we concluded that the beigeing process was more robust in the WAT of Tks4-KO mice compared to the wild-type animals. Furthermore, in the Tks4-KO WAT, the expression profile of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>)-regulated adipogenesis-related genes was shifted in favor of the appearance of beige-like cells. These results suggest that Tks4 and its downstream signaling partners are novel regulators of adipocyte functions and PPAR<U+03B3>-directed white to beige adipose tissue conversion.

Hibernation requires the intricate regulation of physiological and biochemical adaptations to facilitate the decrease in metabolic rate and activation of prosurvival factors needed for winter survival. Mitochondria play important roles in eliciting these responses and in coordinating the required energy shifts. Herein, we report the presence of a novel mitochondrial peptide, s-humanin, in the hibernating 13-lined ground squirrel, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. S-humanin was shown to have strong structural and sequence similarities to its human analogue, humanin-a powerful neuroprotective mitochondrial peptide. An assessment of the protein and gene expression levels of this peptide in ground squirrels revealed stark tissue-specific regulatory responses whereby transcript levels increased in brain cortex, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues during hibernation, suggesting a protective torpor-induced activation. Accompanying peptide measurements found that s-humanin levels were suppressed in liver of torpid squirrels but enhanced in brain cortex. The enhanced transcript and protein levels of s-humanin in brain cortex suggest that it is actively involved in protecting delicate brain tissues and neuronal connections from hibernation-associated stresses. We propose that this squirrel-specific peptide is involved in modulating tissue-specific cytoprotective functions, expanding its role from human-specific neuroprotection to environmental stress protection. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Understanding the molecular mechanisms, which protect against oxidative stress in a model hibernator such as the ground squirrel, could be pivotal to the regulation of cytoprotection. This study expands on our knowledge of metabolic rate depression and could suggest a potential role for humanin therapy in neurodegenerative diseases.

Additive manufacturing (AM) presents the possibility of personalized bone scaffolds with unprecedented structural and functional designs. In contrast to the earlier conventional design concepts, e.g., raster-angle, a workflow was established to produce scaffolds with triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) architecture. A core challenge is the realization of such structures using melt-extrusion based 3D printing. This study presents methods for generation of scaffold design files, finite element analysis of scaffold Young's moduli, AM of scaffolds with polycaprolactone (PCL), and a customized in vitro assay to evaluate cell migration. The reliability of FE analysis when using computer-aided designed models as input may be impeded by anomalies introduced into the scaffolds during 3D printing. Further investigation using micro-computed tomography reconstructions of printed scaffolds as an input for numerical simulation in comparison to experimentally obtained scaffold Young's moduli showed a moderate trend (R2 = 0.62). Interestingly, in a preliminary cell migration assay, adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AdMSC) migrated furthest on PCL scaffolds with Diamond, followed by Gyroid and Schwarz P architectures. A similar trend, but with an accelerated AdMSC migration rate, was observed for PCL scaffolds surface coated with calcium-phosphate-based apatite. We elaborate on the importance of start-to-finish integration of all steps of AM, i.e. design, engineering and manufacturing. Using such a workflow, specific biological and mechanical functionality, e.g., improved regeneration via enhanced cell migration and higher structural integrity, may be realized for scaffolds intended as temporary guiding structures for endogenous tissue regeneration.

BACKGROUND: Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells possess similar functional properties to those of their parent cells, suggesting they could play a pivotal and versatile role in tissue repair and regeneration.METHODS: Using lipotransfer as a surrogate, exosomes were isolated from mouse ADSC-conditioned medium and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, NanoSight, and western blot. Minced fat tissue mixed with ADSC-derived exosomes (Exo), source ADSCs (CAL), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was implanted subcutaneously in the lower back of C57/BL mice bilaterally (n=16 each). Transferred fat tissues were harvested and analyzed at three and ten weeks.RESULTS: At three and ten weeks after the transfer, fat grafts in groups of Exo and CAL showed better fat integrity, fewer oil cysts, and reduced fibrosis. At week ten, graft retention rates in CAL (50.9% ± 2.4%, P= 0.03) and Exo groups (56.4% ± 1.6%, P&lt; 0.001) were significantly higher than the PBS group (40.7% ± 4.7%). Further investigations of macrophage infiltration, inflammatory factors (MIP-1a, MCP-1, IL-1ß, and IL-10), angiogenic factors (HGF, bFGF), adipogenic factors (PPAR<U+03B3>, LDL), and extracellular matrix (Col-3a1, Col-6a3) revealed that ADSC-derived exosomes promoted angiogenesis and up-regulated early inflammation, while during mid to late stages of fat grafting, exerted a pro-adipogenic effect and also increased collagen synthesis level similar to their source ADSCs.CONCLUSIONS: The ADSCs-derived exosomes demonstrated comparable effects to their source cells in achieving improved graft retention by up-regulating early inflammation and augmenting angiogenesis. These features may enable exosomes to be an attractive cell-free alternative in therapeutic regenerative medicine.

INTRODUCTION: Intersphincteric resection (ISR) enables radical sphincter-preserving surgery in a subset of low rectal tumours impinging on the anal sphincter complex (ASC). Excellent anatomical knowledge is essential for optimal ISR. This study describes the role of the longitudinal muscle (LM) in the ASC and implications for ISR and other low rectal and anal pathologies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six human adult en-bloc cadaveric specimens (three males, three females) were obtained from the University of Leeds GIFT Research Tissue Programme. Paraffin embedded mega blocks containing the ASC were produced and serially sectioned at 250<U+2009>µm intervals. Whole mount microscopic sections were histologically stained and digitally scanned.RESULTS: The intersphincteric plane was shown to be potentially very variable. In some places adipose tissue is located between the external anal sphincter (EAS) and internal anal sphincter (IAS), whereas in others the LM interdigitates to obliterate the plane. Elsewhere the LM is (partly) absent with the intersphincteric plane lying on the IAS. The LM gave rise to the formation of the submucosae and corrugator ani muscles by penetrating the IAS and EAS. In four of six specimens, striated muscle fibres from the EAS curled around the distal IAS reaching the anal submucosa.CONCLUSIONS: The ASC formed a complex structure, varying between individuals with an inconstant LM affecting the potential location of the intersphincteric plane as well as a high degree of intermingling striated and smooth muscle fibres potentially further disrupting the plane. The complexity of identifying the correct pathological staging of low rectal cancer is also demonstrated. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pancreatic beta cell protective and glucose uptake enhancing effect of the water extract of Tinospora cordifolia stem (TCSE) by using rat insulinoma (RIN)-m5F cells and 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. RIN-m5F cells were stimulated with interleukin-1ß and interferon-<U+03B3>, and the effect of TCSE on insulin secretion and cytokine-induced toxicity was measured by ELISA and MTT assay, respectively. The glucose uptake and protein expression were measured by fluorometry and western blotting. Antidiabetic effect of TCSE was measured using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. TCSE dose dependently increased cell viability and insulin secretion in RIN-m5F cells. In addition, TCSE increased both the glucose uptake and glucose transporter 4 translocation in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes via PI3K pathway. Finally, TCSE significantly lowered blood glucose and diet intake and increased body weight in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The level of serum insulin and hepatic glycogen was increased, whereas the level of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, dipeptidyl peptidase-4, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was decreased in TCSE-administered rats. TCSE also increased glucose transporter 4 protein expression in the adipose tissue and liver of TCSE-fed diabetic rats. Our results suggested that TCSE preserved RIN-m5F cells from cytokine-induced toxicity and enhanced glucose uptake in 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, which may regulate glucose metabolism in diabetic rats.

PURPOSE: Early weaning (EW) is a risk factor for obesity development. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) hypofunction is related to obesity onset. Here, we evaluated whether sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in BAT and the thermogenic function of BAT are decreased in adulthood in obese rats from two EW models.METHODS: At the time of birth, lactating Wistar rats and their pups (three males and three females) were separated into three groups: the control group, in which pups consumed milk throughout lactation; the non-pharmacological EW (NPEW) group, in which suckling was interrupted with a bandage during the last 3 days of lactation; and the pharmacological EW (PEW) group, in which dams were treated with bromocriptine (0.5 mg/twice a day) 3 days before weaning. The offspring were sacrificed on PN180.RESULTS: Adult male rats from both EW models exhibited lower BAT SNS activity. Female rats from the PEW group showed a decrease in BAT SNS activity. The protein levels of UCP1 were lower in the NPEW males, while PGC1a levels were lower in both PEW and NPEW males. Both groups of EW females showed reductions in the levels of ß3-AR, TRß1, and PGC1a. The UCP1 protein level was reduced only in the NPEW females. The EW groups of both sexes had lower AMPK protein levels in BAT. In the hypothalamus, only the PEW females showed an increase in AMPK protein levels. In both groups of EW males, adrenal catecholamine was increased and tyrosine hydroxylase was decreased, while in EW females, adrenal catecholamine was decreased.CONCLUSIONS: Early weaning alters the thermogenic capacity of BAT, which partially contributes to obesity in adulthood, and there are sex-related differences in these alterations.

The abuse of volatile solvents such as toluene is a significant public health concern, predominantly affecting adolescents. To date, inhalant abuse research has primarily focused on the central nervous system; however, inhalants also exert effects on other organ systems and processes, including metabolic function and energy balance. Adolescent inhalant abuse is characterized by a negative energy balance phenotype, with the peak period of abuse overlapping with the adolescent growth spurt. There are multiple components within the central and peripheral regulation of energy balance that may be affected by adolescent inhalant abuse, such as impaired metabolic signaling, decreased food intake, altered dietary preferences, disrupted glucose tolerance and insulin release, reduced adiposity and skeletal density, and adrenal hypertrophy. These effects may persist into abstinence and adulthood, and the long-term consequences of inhalant-induced metabolic dysfunction are currently unknown. The signs and symptoms resulting from chronic adolescent inhalant abuse may result in a propensity for the development of adult-onset metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, however, further research investigating the long-term effects of inhalant abuse upon energy balance and metabolism are needed. This review addresses several aspects of the short- and long-term effects of inhalant abuse relating to energy and metabolic processes, including energy balance, intake and expenditure; dietary preferences and glycemic control; and the dysfunction of metabolic homeostasis through altered adipose tissue, bone, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.

Autologous fat transplantation has become increasingly popular in recent years. Its biocompatable properties and availability made it a widely used treatment modality for soft tissue augmentation and volume replacement in both reconstructive and aesthetic plastic surgery. Multiple protocols and clinical applications have been described in the literature, with wide variations in the harvesting, processing, and injection techniques. In this review, the authors will discuss the basic principles and clinical applications of fat grafting in plastic and reconstructive surgery. The article will then conclude with a discussion of fat grafting limitations as well as potential future applications, giving the reader a well-rounded understanding of autologous fat transfer.

Although obesity represents a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the link between these pathological conditions is not so clear. The manner in which the different elements of adipose tissue (AT) interplay in order to grow has been suggested to have a role in the genesis of metabolic complications, but this has not yet been fully addressed in humans. Through IHC, transmission electron microscopy, cytometry, and in vitro cultures, we described the morphological and functional changes of subcutaneous and visceral AT (SAT and VAT) in normoglycemic, prediabetic and T2DM patients with obesity compared to lean subjects. In both SAT and VAT we measured a hypertrophic and hyperplastic expansion, causing similar vascular rarefaction in obese patients with different degrees of metabolic complications. Capillaries display dysfunctional basement membrane thickening only in T2DM patients evidencing VAT as a new target of T2DM microangiopathy. The largest increase in adipocyte size and decrease in adipose stem cell number and adipogenic potential occur both in T2DM and in prediabetes. We showed that SAT and VAT remodeling with stemness deficit is associated with early glucose metabolism impairment suggesting the benefit of an AT-target therapy controlling hypertrophy and hyperplasia already in prediabetic obese patients.

BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) have been shown to exhibit some promising properties of their use in regenerative medicine as advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). However, different sources of their origin, methods of isolation, and expansion procedures cause the laboratory and clinical results difficult to compare.METHODS: ASCs were isolated from lipoaspirates and cultured in three different medium formulations: aMEM and DMEM as a basal medium supplemented with 10% of human platelet lysate (hPL) and DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and bFGF as a gold standard medium. Subsequently, the impact of culture media on ASCs growth kinetics, their morphology and immunophenotype, ability to differentiate, clonogenic potential, and secretion profile was evaluated.RESULTS: All cultured ASCs lines showed similar morphology and similar clonogenic potential and have the ability to differentiate into three lines: adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondroblasts. The immunophenotype of all cultured ASCs was consistent with the guidelines of the International Society for Cell Therapy (ISCT) allowing to define cells as mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) (=<U+2009>95% CD105, CD73, CD90 and =<U+2009>2% CD45, CD34, CD14, CD19, HLA-DR). The immunophenotype stabilized after the second passage and did not differ between ASCs cultured in different conditions. The exception was the ASCs grown in the presence of FBS and bFGF, which expressed CD146 antigens. The secretion profile of ASCs cultured in different media was similar. The main secreted cytokine was IL-6, and its level was donor-specific. However, we observed a strong influence of the medium formulation on ASCs growth kinetics. The proliferation rate of ASCs in medium supplemented with hPL was the highest.CONCLUSIONS: Culture media that do not contain animal-derived antigens (xeno-free) can be used to culture cells defined as MSC. Xeno-free medium is a safe alternative for the production of clinical-grade MSC as an advanced therapy medicinal product. Additionally, in such culture conditions, MSC can be easily expanded in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) requirements to a desired amount of cells for clinical applications.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of breed, diet energy source, and their interaction on adipose tissue transcriptome in growing Iberian and Duroc pigs. The study comprised 29 Iberian and 19 Duroc males, which were kept under identical management conditions except the nutritional treatment. Two isoenergetic diets were used with 6% high oleic sunflower oil (HO) or carbohydrates (CH) as energy sources. All animals were slaughtered after 47 days of treatment at an average live weight of 51.2 kg. Twelve animals from each breed (six fed each diet) were employed for ham subcutaneous adipose tissue RNA-Seq analysis. The data analysis was performed using two different bioinformatic pipelines. We detected 837 and 1456 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) according to breed, depending on the pipeline. Due to the strong effect of breed on transcriptome, the effect of the diet was separately evaluated in the two breeds. We identified 207 and 57 DEGs depending on diet in Iberian and Duroc pigs, respectively. A joint analysis of both effects allowed the detection of some breed-diet interactions on transcriptome, which were inferred from RNA-Seq and quantitative PCR data. The functional analysis showed the enrichment of functions related to growth and tissue development, inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and allowed the identification of potential regulators. The results indicate different effects of diet on adipose tissue gene expression between breeds, affecting relevant biological pathways.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been considered beneficial for metabolic health by participating in the regulation of glucose homoeostasis. The browning factors that improve glucose uptake beyond normal levels are still unknown but glucose uptake is not affected in UCP1 knockout mice. Here, we demonstrate in human white adipocytes that basal/resting glucose uptake is improved by solely elevating UCP1 protein levels. Generating human white Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes with a stable knockout and overexpression of UCP1, we discovered that UCP1 overexpressing adipocytes significantly improve glucose uptake by 40%. Mechanistically, this is caused by higher glycolytic flux, seen as increased oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification and lactate secretion rates. The improvements in glucose handling are comparable to white-to-brown transitions, as judged by, for the first time, directly comparing in vitro differentiated mouse brown vs white adipocytes. Although no adipogenic, metabolic and mitochondrial gene expressions were significantly altered in SGBS cells, pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 completely abrogated differences between UCP1+ and control cells, thereby uncovering GLUT1-mediated uptake as permissive gatekeeper. Collectively, our data demonstrate that elevating UCP1 levels is sufficient to improve human white adipocytes as a glucose sink without adverse cellular effects, thus not requiring the adrenergic controlled, complex network of browning which usually hampers translational efforts.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health concern with over 2 million new cases diagnosed and over 600,000 deaths in 2018 in women worldwide. When distant metastases are present at diagnosis, the 5-year survival rate is only 26%. Recent studies have suggested that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that accumulate in adipose tissue (AT) can influence tumor phenotype and stimulate cellular processes important for metastasis such as invasion. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that POP exposure is associated with BC metastasis.METHODS: We conducted an exploratory case-control study in which the concentrations of 49 POPs were measured in both AT and serum samples from BC patients, with or without lymph node metastasis, who underwent partial or total mastectomies, lymph node biopsies and sampling of the adipocytic tumor microenvironment. Adjusted, unconditional logistic models were used to study the associations between the POP concentrations and the risk of metastasis and other hallmarks of cancer aggressiveness.RESULTS: 2.3.7.8-TCDD concentrations in AT are positively associated with the risk of metastasis in 43 patients who have BMIs equal or higher than 25<U+202F>kg/m2 (odds ratio: 4.48 (1.32-20.71)). Furthermore, the concentrations of 2.3.7.8-TCDD and two coplanar PCBs (77&amp;169) in AT also were positively associated with the risk of lymph node metastasis and the tumor size.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that 2.3.7.8-TCDD and some PCBs contribute to the development of tumor metastasis and other hallmarks of cancer aggressiveness. While these results should be considered with caution, this is the first study to identify such potential risk factors. Larger longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm our results.

INTRODUCTION: The epineurium has been accepted as the outer anatomical barrier between the extraneural and intraneural compartments. Our objective was to characterize the microanatomy of the layers surrounding nerves using different tissue-specific staining methods.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-two cross-sections of human sciatic and median nerves, and brachial plexuses of eight fresh unembalmed cadavers, were examined. The samples were fixed in formaldehyde solution and stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Masson's trichrome, or epithelial membrane antigen under standard conditions.RESULTS: Because epithelial membrane antigen only stains the perineurium, we demonstrated using hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome that there were different collagen layers inside and outside the nerves. All fascicles had a collagen layer that surrounded the perineurium and were in close contact with it, with no adipose tissue between them. Unlike the perineurium, this layer, an &quot;internal epineurium,&quot; contained no cells, and it surrounded one or a small group of fascicles. Bundling these fascicles or small groups of fascicles together was the true epineurium, and between the true and internal epineurium, we consistently found an adipose-containing compartment. More proximal to this, the tibial and common peroneal nerves were bundled together by another collagen layer, the circumneurium, which also had a fat-cell-containing compartment deep to it. There were scattered collagen fibers among the adipocytes.CONCLUSIONS: Using tissue-specific staining we were able to demonstrate a collagen layer, the &quot;internal epineurium.&quot; Outside the nerves, we identified several fat-containing concentric compartments. Those compartments were limited by collagen fiber layers that were also similar to the epineurium. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Most synthetic bone grafts are either hard and brittle ceramics or paste-like materials that differ in applicability from the gold standard autologous bone graft, which restricts their widespread use. Therefore, the aim of the study was to develop an elastic, highly porous and biodegradable ß-tricalciumphosphate/poly(L-lactide-co-e-caprolactone) (ß-TCP/PLCL) composite for bone applications using supercritical CO2 foaming. Ability to support osteogenic differentiation was tested in human adipose stem cell (hASC) culture for 21 d. Biocompatibility was evaluated for 24 weeks in a rabbit femur-defect model. Foamed composites had a high ceramic content (50 wt%) and porosity (65-67 %). After 50 % compression, in an aqueous environment at 37 °C, tested samples returned to 95 % of their original height. Hydrolytic degradation of ß-TCP/PLCL composite, during the 24-week follow-up, was very similar to that of porous PLCL scaffold both in vitro and in vivo. Osteogenic differentiation of hASCs was demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase activity analysis, alizarin red staining, soluble collagen analysis, immunocytochemical staining and qRT-PCR. In vitro, hASCs formed a pronounced mineralised collagen matrix. A rabbit femur defect model confirmed biocompatibility of the composite. According to histological Masson-Goldner's trichrome staining and micro-computed tomography, ß-TCP/PLCL composite did not elicit infection, formation of fibrous capsule or cysts. Finally, native bone tissue at 4 weeks was already able to grow on and in the ß-TCP/PLCL composite. The elastic and highly porous ß-TCP/PLCL composite is a promising bone substitute because it is osteoconductive and easy-to-use and mould intraoperatively.

Lipodystrophies are the result of a range of inherited and acquired causes, but all are characterized by perturbations in white adipose tissue function and, in many instances, its mass or distribution. Though patients are often nonobese, they typically manifest a severe form of the metabolic syndrome, highlighting the importance of white fat in the &quot;safe&quot; storage of surplus energy. Understanding the molecular pathophysiology of congenital lipodystrophies has yielded useful insights into the biology of adipocytes and informed therapeutic strategies. More recently, genome-wide association studies focused on insulin resistance have linked common variants to genes implicated in adipose biology and suggested that subtle forms of lipodystrophy contribute to cardiometabolic disease risk at a population level. These observations underpin the use of aligned treatment strategies in insulin-resistant obese and lipodystrophic patients, the major goal being to alleviate the energetic burden on adipose tissue.

Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), a subpopulation of stromal cells in lymphoid organs and fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs) in adipose tissue, play immune-regulatory roles in the host response to infection and may be useful as a form of cell therapy in sepsis. Here, we found an unexpected major role of TLR9 in controlling peritoneal immune cell recruitment and FALC formation at baseline and after sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). TLR9 regulated peritoneal immunity via suppression of chemokine production by FRCs. Adoptive transfer of TLR9-deficient FRCs more effectively decreased mortality, bacterial load, and systemic inflammation after CLP than WT FRCs. Importantly, we found that activation of TLR9 signaling suppressed chemokine production by human adipose tissue-derived FRCs. Together, our results indicate that TLR9 plays critical roles in regulating peritoneal immunity via suppression of chemokine production by FRCs. These data form a knowledge basis upon which to design new therapeutic strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of FRC-based treatments for sepsis and immune dysregulation diseases.

Quercetin possesses various health beneficial functions, but its poor bioavailability limits these functions. Enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ) is a quercetin glycoside with a greater bioavailability than quercetin. In this study, we investigated whether EMIQ regulates energy metabolism in mice and its underlying molecular mechanism. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet with different doses of EMIQ or quercetin (0.02%, 0.1% and 0.5%) for two weeks. Supplementation with 0.1% EMIQ significantly decreased white adipose tissue (WAT) weight. Supplementation with 0.02% and 0.1% EMIQ promoted phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the WAT, liver, and muscle. In the WAT, 0.1% EMIQ downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)<U+03B3>, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)a, C/EBPß, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 expression, as well as upregulated mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) 2 and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 expression. Supplementation with 0.1% EMIQ also promoted the expression of thermogenesis-associated factors including PPAR<U+03B3> coactivator a (PGC-1a), UCP1, PR-domain containing protein 16, and sirtuin 1 in the WAT. In the liver, EMIQ promoted the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and increased the expression of PPARa, constitutive androstane-receptor, and farnesoid X receptor. Furthermore, supplementation with 0.02% or 0.1% EMIQ suppressed the plasma glucose level accompanied by the translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the plasma membrane of the muscle. Our results suggest that EMIQ is a potential food additive for the regulation of energy metabolism through AMPK phosphorylation.

Obesity-related breast cancer is an important threat that affects especially post-menopausal women. The link between obesity and breast cancer seems to be relying on the microenvironment generated at adipose tissue level, which includes inflammatory cytokines. In addition, its association with systemic endocrine changes, including hyperinsulinemia, increased estrogens levels, and hyperleptinemia may be key factors for tumor development. These factors may promote tumor initiation, tumor primary growth, tissue invasion, and metastatic progression. Although the relationship between obesity and breast cancer is already established, the different pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not clear. Obesity-related insulin resistance is a well-known risk factor for breast cancer development in post-menopausal women. However, the role of inflammation and other adipokines, especially leptin, is less studied. Leptin, like insulin, appears to be a growth factor for breast cancer cells. There exists a link between leptin and metabolism of estrogens and between leptin and other factors in a more complex network. As a result, obesity-associated hyperleptinemia has been suggested as an important mediator in the pathophysiology of breast cancer. On the other hand, recent data on the paradoxical effect of obesity on cancer immunotherapy efficacy has brought some controversy, since the proinflammatory effect of leptin may help the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that mediate leptin action may be helpful to understand the underlying processes which link obesity to breast cancer in post-menopausal women, as well as the possible role of leptin in the response to immunotherapy in obese patients.

Obesity-associated inflammation stems from a combination of cell-intrinsic changes of individual immune cell subsets and the dynamic crosstalk amongst a broad array of immune cells. Although much of the focus of immune cell contributions to metabolic disease has focused on adipose tissue-associated cells, these potent sources of inflammation inhabit other metabolic regulatory tissues, including liver and gut, and recirculate to promote systemic inflammation and thus obesity comorbidities. Tissue-associated immune cells, especially T cell subpopulations, have become a hotspot of inquiry based on their contributions to obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and certain types of cancers. The cell-cell interactions that take place under the stress of obesity are mediated by intracellular contact and cytokine production, and constitute a complicated network that drives the phenotypic alterations of immune cells and perpetuates a feed-forward loop of metabolic decline. Herein we discuss immune cell functions in various tissues and obesity-associated cancers from the viewpoint of inflammation. We also emphasize recent advances in the understanding of crosstalk amongst immune cell subsets under obese conditions, and suggest future directions for focused investigations with clinical relevance.

The distribution of adipose tissue is influenced by gender and by age, shifting from subcutaneous to visceral depots with longevity, increasing the development of several aging-related diseases and manifestations such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. Epigenetics might have an important role in aging processes. The aim of this research was to investigate the interactions between aging and epigenetic processes and the role of visceral adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia. Two different study samples of 366 and 269 adult participants were analyzed. Anthropometric, biochemical (including the triglycerides-glucose (TyG) index), and blood pressure measurements were assessed following standardized methods. Body composition measurements by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were also performed for the second sample. Methylation data were assessed by Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip (Illumina) in peripheral white blood cells. Epigenetic age acceleration was calculated using the methods DNAmAge (AgeAcc) and GrimAge (AgeAccGrim). Age acceleration (AgeAccGrim) showed better correlations than AgeAcc with most of the measured variables (waist circumference, glucose, HOMA-IR, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and TyG index) for the first sample. In the second sample, all the previous correlations were confirmed, except for HOMA-IR. In addition, many of the anthropometrical measurements assessed by DXA and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also statistically associated with AgeAccGrim. Associations separated by sex showed statistically significant correlations between AgeAccGrim and HDL-cholesterol or CRP in women, whereas, in men, the association was with visceral adipose tissue mass DXA, triglycerides and TyG index. Linear regression models (model 1 included visceral adipose tissue mass DXA and TyG index and model 2 included HDL-cholesterol and CRP) showed a significant association for men concerning visceral adipose tissue mass DXA and TyG index, while HDL-cholesterol and CRP were associated in women. Moreover, structural equation modeling showed that the TyG index was mediating the majority of the visceral adipose tissue mass action on age acceleration. Collectively, these findings showed that there are different mechanisms affecting epigenetic age acceleration depending on sex. The identified relationships between epigenetic age acceleration and disease markers will contribute to the understanding of the development of age-related diseases.

As the second cause of death and cognitive decline in industrialized countries, stroke is a major burden for society. Vascular risks factors such as hypertension and diabetes are involved in most stroke patients, aggravate stroke severity, but are still poorly taken into account in preclinical studies. Microangiopathy and sustained inflammation are exacerbated, likely explaining the severity of stroke in those patients. We sought to demonstrate that intravenous administration of human adipose derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSC) that have immunomodulatory properties, could accelerate sensorimotor recovery, prevent long-term spatial memory impairment and promote neurogenesis, in diabetic or hypertensive mice, subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). Diabetic (streptozotocin IP) or hypertensive (L-NAME in drinking water) male C57Bl6 mice subjected to pMCAo, were treated by hADMSC (500,000 cells IV) 2 days after cerebral ischemia induction. Infarct volume, neurogenesis, microglial/macrophage density, T-lymphocytes density, astrocytes density, and vessel density were monitored 7 days after cells injection and at 6 weeks. Neurological sensorimotor deficit and spatial memory were assessed until 6 weeks post-stroke. Whatever the vascular risk factor, hADMSC showed no effect on functional sensorimotor recovery or cognitive decline prevention at short or long-term assessment, nor significantly modified neurogenesis, microglial/macrophage, T-lymphocytes, astrocytes, and vessel density. This work is part of a European program (H2020, RESSTORE). We discuss the discrepancy of our results with those obtained in rats and the optimal cell injection time frame, source and type of cells according to the species stroke model. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms preventing recovery should help for successful clinical translation, but first could allow identifying good and bad responders to cell therapy in stroke.

OBJECTIVES: The incidence of obesity and obesity-assosiated pathologies continues to increase with profound adverse effects on health status in the developed countries.BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the effect of high fat diet on the adrenal gland morphology.METHODS: We fed the mice with either high-fat diet (60 % kcal from fat) or low-fat diet (10 % kcal from fat) for nine weeks. Unbiased stereological methods were used to evaluate the adrenal gland morphology. The sections were evaluated using Cavalieri's method and volume fraction approach. We calculated mean volume of adrenal gland, mean volume of adrenal medulla, VVadrenal medulla/adrenal gland, mean diameter of cromaffin cells, number of chromaffin cells in per unit volume (NVcc mm<U+2012>3), total number of cromaffin cells, VVzona glomerulosa/adrenal cortex, VVzona fasciculata/adrenal cortex , VVzona reticulosa/adrenal cortex.RESULTS: The weight of adrenal gland, body weight intraperitoneal adipose tissue and adrenal gland weight in the obese mice significantly increased when compared with the control group. No changes were observed in the mean volume of adrenal gland, mean volume of adrenal medulla, VVzona glomerulosa/adrenal cortex, VVzona fasciculata/adrenal cortex, total number of cromaffin cells and diameter of cromaffin cells. However, NVcc mm-3 and VVzona reticulosa/adrenal cortex in the obese mice considerably increased compared with the control group.CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that high fat diet adversely affects the adrenal gland morphology (Tab. 2, Fig. 6, Ref. 28).

Thymol is a major component of thyme, and it has been reported that thymol administration reduces body weight, plasma insulin and blood glucose in type-2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle is the most important metabolism organs in the body; however, to date, there is no report on the effect of thymol on skeletal muscle. Our goal was to determine whether thymol has an effect on the different types of skeletal muscle fibers and their metabolism characteristics. Hence, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments. In vivo, SD rats (4 weeks old) were fed with different concentrations of thymol for 4 weeks, and in vitro C2C12 myotubes were directly treated with thymol for 2 days. The rats fed with 0.025% thymol showed a significantly lower body weight, subcutaneous white adipose tissue index and gastrocnemius muscle index (P &lt; 0.05), while their proportion of brown adipose tissue significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05). The protein and mRNA expression of MyHC I and MyHC IIa in the gastrocnemius muscle of the rats significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), while the protein level of MyHC II and mRNA expression of MyHC IIb decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, 0.025% thymol supplement significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the gastrocnemius muscle of the rats, but their succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and hexokinase (HK) activities increased (P &lt; 0.05). Also, the expression of the fatty acid oxidation-related genes in the gastrocnemius muscle of the rats decreased with the thymol supplement (P &lt; 0.05). In vitro, similar results were obtained. Furthermore, the Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT pathway, which is an important pathway to regulate the transformation of skeletal muscle fiber type, was studied. We found that the effects of thymol on the myosin heavy chain isoforms, genes related to metabolism and the activation of the Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT pathway were all reversed by a Ca2+ chelator (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, thymol can promote the oxidative metabolism and fiber type switch in skeletal muscle, and the Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT pathway plays an important role in it.

BACKGROUND: Although some studies have reported significant reductions in food cravings following the single-session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), there is little research on the effects of multi-session of rTMS on food consumption and body weight in obese subjects.OBJECTIVE: We conducted 4-week randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial to examine the effect of rTMS on body weight in obese adults.RESULTS: Participants in the rTMS group showed significantly greater weight loss from baseline following the 8 session of rTMS (-2.75<U+202F>±<U+202F>2.37<U+202F>kg vs. 0.38<U+202F>±<U+202F>1.0<U+202F>kg, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.01). Consistent with weight loss, there was a significant reduction in fat mass and visceral adipose tissue at week 4 in the rTMS group compared with the control group (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.01). After the 8 sessions of rTMS, the TMS group consumed fewer total kilocalories and carbohydrates per day than the control group (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: 8 sessions of HF rTMS delivered to the left DLPFC were effective in inducing weight loss and decreasing food intake in obese patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial registered with the Clinical Trials Registry at http://cris.cdc.go.kr (KCT0002548).

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increased glucose production associated with hepatic insulin resistance contributes to the development of hyperglycemia in T2D. The molecular mechanisms accounting for increased glucose production remain controversial. Our aims were to review recent literature concerning molecular mechanisms regulating glucose production and to discuss these mechanisms in the context of physiological experiments and observations in humans and large animal models.RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic intervention studies in rodents demonstrate that insulin can control hepatic glucose production through both direct effects on the liver, and through indirect effects to inhibit adipose tissue lipolysis and limit gluconeogenic substrate delivery. However, recent experiments in canine models indicate that the direct effects of insulin on the liver are dominant over the indirect effects to regulate glucose production. Recent molecular studies have also identified insulin-independent mechanisms by which hepatocytes sense intrahepatic carbohydrate levels to regulate carbohydrate disposal. Dysregulation of hepatic carbohydrate sensing systems may participate in increased glucose production in the development of diabetes.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are used extensively in cell therapy for repair and regeneration of several organs and tissues. Cell therapy is a valuable option to treat neurodegenerative diseases and MSCs have been shown to improve neuronal function through direct differentiation or secretion of neurotrophic factors. In the present study, we isolated and characterized stem cells from medial and central orbital adipose tissue and found that they could be grown in a monolayer culture. The orbital adipose tissue-derived cells were identical to bone marrow-derived MSCs in their cell surface marker expression, gene expression and multilineage differentiation abilities. The orbital adipose-derived MSCs (OAMSCs) express several neurotrophic factors, possess neuroectodermal differentiation ability and secreted factors from OAMSCs abrogated neuronal cell damage induced by oxidative stress. Thus, OAMSCs might be a valuable cell source for treatment of neurological diseases and to reverse oxidative damage in the neuronal cells.

OBJECTIVE: Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital malformation. In adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is increased. Beyond its immanent health risks, increased epi- and paracardial adipose tissue has been described in MDD. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a fat depot surrounding the heart, and it is hypothesized to be associated with coronary artery disease, left-ventricular dysfunction and atrial fibrillation, being frequent problems in ACHD long-term management. We here examined whether EAT is increased in depressed patients with ACHD.METHODS: Two-hundred and ten ACHD outpatients (mean age 35.5y, 43% female) were included. MDD was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria using expert interviews. EAT was measured using echocardiography. Further assessments comprised NT-proBNP, left and right ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left-ventricular ejection fraction, smoking behavior and physical activity.RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 53 (25.2%) were diagnosed with MDD. EAT was increased in depressed ACHD (F<U+202F>=<U+202F>5.04; df = 1; p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.026). Depressed male patients were less physically active (p &lt; 0.05) and smoked more cigarettes (p &lt; 0.05). EAT was positively predicted by depression severity (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.039), body mass index (p &lt; 0.001), and negatively predicted by physical activity (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MDD is associated with an increased amount of EAT in ACHD, and is dependent on depression severity. Further, the amount of EAT is at least in part mediated by a more sedentary lifestyle. Given the long-term health risks associated with increased EAT, interventions aiming at increased physical activity, smoking cessation and early identification of comorbid MDD may be recommended in ACHD.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We investigated how vasoreactivity in the brachial artery and the forearm resistance vessels were related to fat distribution and tissue volume, using both traditional imaging analysis and a new technique, called &quot;Imiomics&quot;, whereby vasoreactivity was related to each of the &gt;2M 3D image elements included in the whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS AND RESULTS: In 326 subjects in the Prospective investigation of Obesity, Energy and Metabolism (POEM) study (all aged 50 years), endothelium-dependent vasodilation was measured by acetylcholine infusion in the brachial artery (EDV) and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). Fat distribution was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). EDV, but not FMD, was significantly related to total fat mass, liver fat, subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue in a negative fashion in women, but not in men. Using Imiomics, an inverse relationship was seen between EDV and a local tissue volume of SAT in both the upper part of the body, as well as the gluteo-femoral part and the medial parts of the legs in women. Also the size of the liver, heart and VAT was inversely related to EDV. In men, less pronounced relationships were seen. FMD was also significantly related to local tissue volume of upper-body SAT and liver fat in women, but less so in men.CONCLUSION: EDV, and to a lesser degree also FMD, were related to liver fat, SAT and VAT in women, but less so in men. Imiomics both confirmed findings from traditional methods and resulted in new, more detailed results.

PURPOSE: During radiotherapy the peritumoral tissues are daily exposed to subtherapeutic doses of ionizing radiation. Herein, the biological and molecular effects of doses lower than 0.8<U+202F>Gy per fraction (LDIR), previously described as angiogenesis inducers, were assessed in human peritumoral tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired biopsies of preperitoneal adipose tissue were surgically collected from 16 patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neo-adjuvant radiotherapy. One of the biopsies is located in the vicinity of the region where the tumor received the prescribed dose of radiation, and thus exposed to LDIR; the other specimen, outside all beam apertures, was used as an internal calibrator (IC). Microvessel density (MDV) was quantified by immunohistochemistry and the expression of several pro-angiogenic genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using exclusively endothelial cells (ECs) isolated by laser capture microdissection microscopy.RESULTS: LDIR activated peritumoral ECs by significantly up-regulating the expression of several pro-angiogenic genes such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, ANGPT2, TGFB2, VWF, FGF2, HGF and PDGFC. Accordingly, the MVD was significantly increased in peritumoral tissues exposed to LDIR, compared to the IC. The patients that yielded a larger pro-angiogenic response, also showed the highest MVD.CONCLUSIONS: LDIR activate ECs in peritumoral tissues that are associated with increased MVD. Although the technological advances in radiotherapy have contributed to reduce the damage to healthy tissues over the past years, the anatomical regions receiving LDIR should be taken into account in the treatment plan report for patient follow-up and in future studies to correlate these doses with tumor dissemination.

BACKGROUND: Fibrous hamartoma of infancy(FHI) is a rare benign lesion most frequently occurring within the first year of life. So far, just over 200 cases have been reported in the English literature, in which the radiologic findings of FHI have not been fully described. Herein, 2 adult cases of FHI receiving treatment in our hospital and the published cases searched on PubMed are reviewed, with the emphasis on the discussion of the spectrum of MR findings and their histologic correlation.CASE PRESENTATION: We present two adult cases who aged 47<U+2009>years and 19<U+2009>years with slow growing masses beginning from their childhood in the posterior craniocervical area. On CT and MR imaging, the tumours showed as the superficially located lesions with ill-defined margins that involved the subcutaneous layer and its underlying muscles. The size of the lesions were 21.3<U+2009>×<U+2009>16.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>16<U+2009>cm in case 1 and 20.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>19.3<U+2009>×<U+2009>13.6<U+2009>cm in case 2. The tumours demonstrated heterogeneous intensities/signals with the adipose tissue presenting as the disperse strands or small focus of fatty intensity/signal. Parallel or whirling appearance, and dilated vessels were delineated in the cases. Contrast enhancement was administered in case 1 and marked enhancement was found.CONCLUSIONS: The usually observed manifestation of FHI on CT and/or MR imaging is the strands of adipose/fibrous intensities traversing the lesions, with the characteristic parallel or whirling appearance in some cases. The tumours with ill-defined margins have the tendency to involve the underlying muscles. Some fibroblastic and adipocytic tumours should be ruled out in differential diagnosis.

Approximately 1% of the male population suffers from obstructive or non-obstructive azoospermia. Previous in vitro studies have successfully differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into germ cells. Because of immunemodulating features, safety, and simple isolation, adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) are good candidates for such studies. However, low availability is the main limitation in using these cells. Different growth factors have been investigated to overcome this issue. In the present study, we aimed to comparatively assess the performance of AT-MSCs cultured under the presence or absence of three different growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), following transplantation in testicular torsion-detorsion mice.</AbstractText>: Approximately 1% of the male population suffers from obstructive or non-obstructive azoospermia.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality as well as a public health burden considering the high costs of AF-related hospitalizations. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence showed a potential role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the etiopathogenesis of AF. Among RAS mediators, angiotensin II (AII) and angiotensin 1-7 (A1-7) have been mostly investigated in AF. Specifically, the stimulation of the pathway mediated by AII or the inhibition of the pathway mediated by A1-7 may participate in inducing and sustaining AF. In this review, we summarize the evidence showing that both RAS pathways may balance the onset of AF through different biological mechanisms involving inflammation, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) accumulation, and electrical cardiac remodeling. EAT is a predictor for AF as it may induce its onset through direct (infiltration of epicardial adipocytes into the underlying atrial myocardium) and indirect (release of inflammatory adipokines, the stimulation of oxidative stress, macrophage phenotype switching, and AF triggers) mechanisms. Classic RAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may prevent AF by affecting the accumulation of the EAT, representing a useful therapeutic strategy for preventing AF especially in patients with heart failure and known left ventricular dysfunction. Further studies are necessary to prove this benefit in patients with other cardiovascular diseases. Finally, the possibility of using the A1-7 or ACE2 analogues, to enlarge current therapeutic options for AF, may represent an important field of research.

Type-2 Familial Partial Lipodystrophy is caused by LMNA mutations. Patients gradually lose subcutaneous fat from the limbs, while they accumulate adipose tissue in the face and neck. Several studies have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and the maintenance of the balance between white and brown adipose tissue. We identified deregulation of autophagy in laminopathic preadipocytes before induction of differentiation. Moreover, in differentiating white adipocyte precursors, we observed impairment of large lipid droplet formation, altered regulation of adipose tissue genes, and expression of the brown adipose tissue marker UCP1. Conversely, in lipodystrophic brown adipocyte precursors induced to differentiate, we noticed activation of autophagy, formation of enlarged lipid droplets typical of white adipocytes, and dysregulation of brown adipose tissue genes. In agreement with these in vitro results indicating conversion of FPLD2 brown preadipocytes toward the white lineage, adipose tissue from FPLD2 patient neck, an area of brown adipogenesis, showed a white phenotype reminiscent of its brown origin. Moreover, in vivo morpho-functional evaluation of fat depots in the neck area of three FPLD2 patients by PET/CT analysis with cold stimulation showed the absence of brown adipose tissue activity. These findings highlight a new pathogenetic mechanism leading to improper fat distribution in lamin A-linked lipodystrophies and show that both impaired white adipocyte turnover and failure of adipose tissue browning contribute to disease.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the differences among adult and foetal equine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and no data exist about their comparative ultrastructural morphology. The aim of this study was to describe and compare characteristics, immune properties, and ultrastructural morphology of equine adult (bone marrow: BM, and adipose tissue: AT) and foetal adnexa derived (umbilical cord blood: UCB, and Wharton's jelly: WJ) MSCs.RESULTS: No differences were observed in proliferation during the first 3 passages. While migration ability was similar among cells, foetal MSCs showed a higher adhesion ability, forming smaller spheroids after hanging drop culture (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). All MSCs differentiated toward adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages, only tenogenic differentiation was less evident for WJ-MSCs. Data obtained by PCR confirmed MHC1 expression and lack of MHC2 expression in all four cell types. Foetal adnexa MSCs were positive for genes specific for anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factors (IL6, IL8, ILß1) and WJ-MSCs were the only positive for OCT4 pluripotency gene. At immunofluorescence all cells expressed typical mesenchymal markers (a-SMA, N-cadherin), except for BM-MSCs, which did not express N-cadherin. By transmission electron microscopy, it was observed that WJ-MSCs had a higher (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) number of microvesicles compared to adult MSCs, and UCB-MSCs showed more microvesicles than BM-MSCs (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). AT-MSCs had a lower number of mitochondria than WJ-MSCs (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), and mitochondrial area was higher for WJ-MSCs compared to UCB and AT-MSCs (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that MSCs from adult and foetal tissues have different characteristics, and foetal MSCs, particularly WJ derived ones, seem to have some charactestics that warrant further investigation into potential advantages for clinical application.

Soy isoflavones are natural active ingredients of soy plants that are beneficial to many metabolic diseases, especially obesity. Many studies have reported that obesity is closely related to visceral fatty acid metabolism, but the effect has not been well defined. In this study, we show that soy isoflavones improve visceral fatty acid metabolism in diet-induced obese male rats, which was indicated by reduced body weight and visceral fat cell area, as well as suppressed visceral fat synthesis and accelerated fat hydrolysis. We also found that common components of soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, were able to inhibit the lipid accumulation process in 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, we showed that soy isoflavones can promote on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity both in vivo and in vitro, which may be implicated in lipid metabolism regulation of soy isoflavones. Our study demonstrates the potential of soy isoflavones as a mechanism for regulating lipid homeostasis in visceral adipose tissue, proven to be beneficial for obesity treatment.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Exercise therapy is the most effective treatment for patients with NAFLD. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is attracting attention as a time-efficient and an effective exercise modality for treating patients with NAFLD. Previous studies have shown that HIIT can reduce fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and intrahepatic lipid levels and improve hepatic stiffness. HIIT may be an optimal exercise therapy to improve NAFLD in patients with a lack of time.

BACKGROUND: Constitutional thinness (CT) is a state of low but stable body weight (BMI =18 kg/m2). CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.METHODS: We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/m2) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 µm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 µm2) (P &lt; 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P &lt; 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P &lt; 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or &quot;browning&quot; of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change &gt;0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS: The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals. This knowledge could ultimately allow more targeted approaches for weight management treatment strategies. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02004821.

Obesity is responsible for metabolic dysregulations that alter fertility and induce pathologies. The objectives of the present study were to validate a reliable method for the evaluation of body fatness in mares and to associate the body fat estimation data to metabolic changes, including adipokines at the plasma and adipose tissue levels. To reach this purpose, animals were subjected to two extreme breeding conditions to study the variation of morphological, ultrasound, and physiological parameters. Twenty Welsh mares were followed up monthly from April to October before and after animals were moved outdoors to grasslands. Body weight (BW), body length (BL), height at the withers (HW), thoracic perimeter (TP), 5-point body condition score (BCS), and subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) at the level of the shoulder, the lumbar region, and the rump, measured by ultrasonography, and plasma and adipose tissue metabolic indicators were assessed in parallel. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effects model, whereas Pearson tests were used for the analysis of the correlations between the different parameters. Although mean BW did not increase significantly (P = 0.0940), TP (P = 0.0002) and BCS (P &lt; 0.0001) increased during the study period. Ultrasonographic examination of subcutaneous adipose tissue showed an increase in SFT at the level of the shoulder (P &lt; 0.0001), lumbar region (P &lt; 0.0001), and rump (P &lt; 0.0001). Plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (P &lt; 0.0001), phospholipids (P &lt; 0.0001), and cholesterol (P &lt; 0.0001) increased significantly, whereas triglycerides (P &lt; 0.0001) decreased significantly during the study period. Although both plasma concentrations and adipose tissue expression of leptin (P &lt; 0.0001) and resistin (P &lt; 0.0001) increased significantly, adiponectin (P &lt; 0.0001) significantly decreased and visfatin remained unchanged (P = 0.8401). Expression of adipokine receptors studied showed the opposite pattern compared with their ligand. Ultrasonographic measurements of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness at the shoulder, lumbar region, and rump are relevant indicators of fatness related with adipokine plasma concentrations and expression of adipokine-related receptors in adipose tissue, and particularly highlight seasonal effects.

Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) plays an important role in white-to-brown adipose tissue conversion in mice. However, there is no report on the role of this protein in Arbas Cashmere goat adipose tissue. We investigated the effect of FNDC5 on the proliferation and differentiation of goat adipose-derived stem cells (gADSCs). We found that FNDC5 promotes the proliferation of gADSCs and increases the levels of p-ERK and p-p38, while it has no effect on the levels of ERK, p38, AKT and p-AKT. What's more, FNDC5 promotes the differentiation of gADSCs into lipid droplets. Overexpression of FNDC5 increased the protein levels of ASC1, UCP1, PPAR<U+03B3> and SREBP1. Additionally, mRNA levels of PPAR<U+03B3>, SREBP1, ACC, and FABP4 increased significantly. FNDC5 knockdown was associated with opposite effects. These results suggest that FNDC5 promotes the proliferation of gADSCs via MAPK signaling pathway and also induces the differentiation of these cells.

The aim of the study was to determine the effects of exercise training on improving the thoracic perivascular adipose tissue (tPVAT) phenotype (inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteasome function) in metabolic syndrome and its subsequent actions on aortic function.METHODS: Lean and obese (model of metabolic syndrome) Zucker rats (n=8/group) underwent 8-weeks of control conditions or treadmill exercise (70% of max speed, 1<U+202F>h/day, 5 days/week). At the end of the intervention, the tPVAT was removed and conditioned media was made. The cleaned aorta was attached to a force transducer to assess endothelium-dependent and independent dilation in the presence or absence of tPVAT-conditioned media. tPVAT gene expression, inflammatory /oxidative phenotype, and proteasome function were assessed.CONCLUSION: Overall, exercise had the most dramatic impact on the obese tPVAT reflecting a change towards an environment with less oxidant load, less inflammation and improved proteasome function. Such beneficial changes to the tPVAT micro-environment with exercise likely played a significant role in mediating the improvement in aortic function in metabolic syndrome following 8 weeks of exercise.

BACKGROUND: Intra-articular injection of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) has shown promise for improving symptoms and cartilage quality in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). However, while most preclinical studies have been performed with plastic-adherent ASCs, most clinical trials are being conducted with the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), prepared from adipose tissue without prior culture.PURPOSE: To directly compare clinical outcomes of intra-articular injection with ASCs or SVF in patients with knee OA.STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.METHODS: The authors retrospectively compared 6-month outcomes in 42 patients (59 knees) receiving intra-articular injection with 12.75 million ASCs and 38 patients (69 knees) receiving a 5-mL preparation of SVF. All patients had Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2, 3, or 4 knee OA and had failed standard medical therapy. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after injection were considered as outcomes. Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) criteria were also used to assess positive response. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used for comparison between the treatment groups.CONCLUSION: It was observed that both ASCs and SVF resulted in clinical improvement in patients with knee OA, but that ASCs outperform SVF in the early reduction of symptoms and pain with less comorbidity.

Emphasizing the role of hydrogel stiffness and cellular differentiation, this study develops collagen and elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-based bone regenerative hydrogels loaded with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and doxycycline with mechanical properties suitable for osteogenesis. The drug-incorporated collagen-ELP hydrogels has significantly higher modulus of 35 ± 5 kPa compared to collagen-only hydrogels. Doxycycline shows a bi-phasic release with an initial burst release followed by a gradual release, while rhBMP-2 exhibits a nearly linear release profile for all hydrogels. The released doxycycline shows anti-microbial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Escherichia coli. Microscopic observation of the hydrogels reveals their interconnected, macroporous, 3D open architecture with pore diameters between 160 and 400 µm. This architecture supports human adipose-derived stem cell attachment and proliferation from initial days of cell seeding, forming a thick cellular sheath by day 21. Interestingly, in collagen and collagen-ELP hydrogels, cell morphology is elongated with stretched slender lamellipodial formation, while cells assemble as spheroidal aggregates in crosslinked as well as drug-loaded hydrogels. Osteogenic markers, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, are expressed maximally for drug-loaded hydrogels compared to those without drugs. The drug-loaded collagen-ELP hydrogels are thus promising for combating bacterial infection and promoting guided bone regeneration.

This review summarizes current knowledge on the biological relevance of carotenoids and some of their metabolites in obesity management. The relationship between carotenoids and obesity is considered in clinical studies and in preclinical studies. Adipose tissue is a key organ in obesity etiology and the main storage site for carotenoids. We thus first describe carotenoid metabolism in adipocyte and adipose tissue and the effects of carotenoids on biological processes in adipose tissue that may be linked to obesity management in in vitro and preclinical studies. It is also now well established that the brain is strongly involved in obesity processes. A section is accordingly devoted to the potential effect of carotenoids on obesity via their direct and/or adipose tissue-driven indirect biological effects on the brain.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of homocysteine (Hcy) on CD36, PPAR<U+03B3>, and C/EBPa gene and protein expression in adipose tissue obtained from normal and high-calorie diet obesity models. CD36, PPAR<U+03B3>, and C/EBPa gene expression and protein levels in adipose tissue specimens were determined using the RT-PCR and ELISA methods, respectively. Significantly increased CD36 gene expression was observed in adipose tissue from obese mice, while Hcy significantly reduced CD36 gene expression in adipose tissue from normal and obese mice. PPAR<U+03B3> and C/EBPa gene expression levels decreased significantly in all groups compared to the normal group. In addition, levels of both PPAR<U+03B3> and C/EBPa gene expression were lower with Hcy supplementation compared to their own controls. In conclusion, Hcy's reduction of CD36 gene expression in adipose tissue may be one probable factor in hyperhomocysteinemia representing an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

The incidence and prevalence of metabolic and musculoskeletal diseases are increasing. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance, inflammation, advanced glycation end-product accumulation and increased oxidative stress. These characteristics can negatively affect various aspects of muscle health, including muscle mass, strength, quality and function through impairments in protein metabolism, vascular and mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. Sarcopenia is a term used to describe the age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass and function and has been implicated as both a cause and consequence of T2DM. Sarcopenia may contribute to the development and progression of T2DM through altered glucose disposal due to low muscle mass, and also increased localized inflammation, which can arise through inter- and intramuscular adipose tissue accumulation. Lifestyle modifications are important for improving and maintaining mobility and metabolic health in individuals with T2DM and sarcopenia. However, evidence for the most effective and feasible exercise and dietary interventions in this population is lacking. In this review, we discuss the current literature highlighting the bidirectional relationship between T2DM and sarcopenia, highlight current research gaps and treatments, and provide recommendations for future research.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation. Increased hepatic saturated fats and decreased hepatic polyunsaturated fats may be particularly lipotoxic, contributing to metabolic dysfunction. We compared hepatic lipid subspecies in adults with and without NAFLD, and examined links with hallmark metabolic and clinical characteristics of NAFLD.CONCLUSION: Participants with NAFLD preferentially stored excess hepatic lipids as saturated fat, at the expense of unsaturated fat, compared to controls. This hepatic lipid profile was accompanied by an unhealthy metabolic phenotype.

The impact of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ was evaluated in the metabolic alterations and the adipose tissue remodeling associated with obesity. Male Wistar rats were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD; 35% fat) or a standard diet (3.5% fat) for 7 wk and treated with MitoQ (200 µM). A proteomic analysis of visceral adipose tissue from patients with obesity and patients without obesity was performed. MitoQ partially prevented the increase in body weight, adiposity, homeostasis model assessment index, and adipose tissue remodeling in HFD rats. It also ameliorated protein level changes of factors involved in insulin signaling observed in adipose tissue of obese rats: reductions in adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) and increases in dipeptidylpeptidase 4, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation. MitoQ prevented down-regulation of adiponectin and GLUT 4 and increases in SOCS3 levels in a TNF-a-induced insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocyte model. MitoQ also ameliorated alterations in mitochondrial proteins observed in obese rats: increases in cyclophylin F and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A and reductions in mitofusin1, peroxiredoxin 4, and fumarate hydratase. The proteomic analysis of the visceral adipose tissue from patients with obesity show alterations in mitochondrial proteins similar to those observed in obese rats. Therefore, the data show the beneficial effect of MitoQ in the metabolic dysfunction induced by obesity.-Marín-Royo, G., Rodríguez, C., Le Pape, A., Jurado-López, R., Luaces, M., Antequera, A., Martínez-González, J., Souza-Neto, F.

While it is now understood that the proper expansion of adipose tissue is critically important for metabolic homeostasis, it is also appreciated that adipose tissues perform far more functions than simply maintaining energy balance. Adipose tissue performs endocrine functions, secreting hormones or adipokines that affect the regulation of extra-adipose tissues, and, under certain conditions, can also be major contributors to energy expenditure and the systemic metabolic rate via the activation of thermogenesis. Adipose thermogenesis takes place in brown and beige adipocytes. While brown adipocytes have been relatively well studied, the study of beige adipocytes has only recently become an area of considerable exploration. Numerous suggestions have been made that beige adipocytes can elicit beneficial metabolic effects on body weight, insulin sensitivity, and lipid levels. However, the potential impact of beige adipocyte thermogenesis on systemic metabolism is not yet clear and an understanding of beige adipocyte development and regulation is also limited. This review will highlight our current understanding of beige adipocytes and select factors that have been reported to elicit the development and activation of thermogenesis in beige cells, with a focus on factors that may represent a link between exercise and 'beiging', as well as the role that thyroid hormone signaling plays in beige adipocyte regulation.

Tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor outcome in several human malignancies. Additionally, the presence of functional lymphatic vessels regulates the formation of tumor inflammatory and immune microenvironments. Although lymphatic structures are often found deeply integrated into the fabric of adipose tissue, the impact of lymphangiogenesis on tumor-associated adipose tissue has not yet been investigated. Using K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice that constitutively express soluble VEGFR3-Ig in the skin, scavenging VEGF-C and VEGF-D, the role of lymphangiogenesis in the generation of an inflammatory response within tumor-associated adipose tissue was studied. Macrophages expressing the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 were found within peritumoral adipose tissue from melanoma-bearing K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice, which were further enriched with alternatively activated macrophages based on surface marker CD301/CLEC10A expression. The blockade of lymphangiogenesis also resulted in accumulation of the cytokine interleukin-6, which correlated with enhanced macrophage proliferation of the alternatively activated phenotype. Furthermore, melanomas co-implanted with freshly isolated adipose tissue macrophages grew more robustly when compared with melanomas growing alone. In human cutaneous melanomas, adipocyte-selective FABP4 transcripts closely correlated with gene signatures of CLEC10A and were associated with poor overall survival. These data suggest that the blockade of pathways regulating lymphatic vessel formation shapes an inflammatory response within tumor-associated adipose tissue by facilitating accumulation of tumor-promoting alternatively activated macrophages.

Lipid species patterns are conserved within cells to maintain physicochemical properties of membranes and cellular functions. We present the lipidome, including sterols, glycerolipids (GLs), glycerophospholipids (GPLs), and sphingolipids (SLs), of primary ex vivo differentiated (I) white, (II) brite, and (III) brown adipocytes derived from primary preadipocytes isolated from (I) epididymal white, (II) inguinal white, and (III) intrascapular brown adipose tissue. Quantitative lipidomics revealed significantly decreased fractions of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), with longer (C &gt; 36) and more polyunsaturated species, as well as lower levels of cardiolipin (CL) in white than in brite and brown adipocytes. Together, the brite and brown lipidome was comparable and indicates differences in membrane lipid packing density compared with white adipocytes. Changes in ceramide species profile could be related to the degree of browning. Beta-adrenergic stimulation of brown adipocytes led to generation of saturated lyso-PC (LPC) increasing uncoupling protein (UCP) 1-mediated leak respiration. Application of stable isotope labeling showed that LPC formation was balanced by an increased de novo synthesis of PC.

PURPOSE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major source of morbidity and mortality among breast cancer survivors. Although body mass index (BMI) is associated with CVD risk, adipose tissue distribution may better identify patients with a high risk of CVD after breast cancer.METHODS: Among 2,943 patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer without prior CVD, we used International Classification of Diseases (9th and 10th revisions) codes to identify incidence of nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or CVD death. From clinically acquired computed tomography scans obtained near diagnosis, we measured visceral adiposity (centimeters squared), subcutaneous adiposity (centimeters squared), and intramuscular adiposity (fatty infiltration into muscle [Hounsfield Units, scored inversely]). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs per SD increase in adiposity accounting for competing risks and adjusting for demographics, smoking, cancer treatment, and pre-existing CVD risk factors.RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 56 (12) years. Over a median follow-up of 6 years, 328 CVD events occurred. Each SD increase in visceral or intramuscular adiposity was associated with an increase in CVD risk (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.29] and HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.37]), respectively). Excess visceral and intramuscular adiposity occurred across all BMI categories. Among normal-weight patients, each SD greater visceral adiposity increased CVD risk by 70% (HR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.10 to 2.62]).CONCLUSION: Visceral and intramuscular adiposity were associated with increased CVD incidence after breast cancer diagnosis, independent of pre-existing CVD risk factors and cancer treatments. The increased CVD incidence among normal-weight patients with greater visceral adiposity would go undetected with BMI alone. Measures of adipose tissue distribution may help identify high-risk patients and tailor CVD prevention strategies.

Several studies indicated that ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) enhances thermogenesis and/or energy expenditure with which to interpret the beneficial effects of ginger on metabolic disorders. It is well known that mitochondrial activity plays an essential role in these processes. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of ginger extract (GE) and its major components, 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol, on mitochondrial biogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that GE at dose of 2 g/kg promoted oxygen consumption and intrascapular temperature in mice. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in muscle and liver increased. Expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) related proteins and AMP-activated protein kinase <U+0251>/proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 <U+0251> (AMPK/PGC1<U+0251>) signaling related proteins in the muscle, liver, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) increased as well. In HepG2 cells, GE at concentration of 2.5 and 5 mg/mL increased mitochondrial mass and mtDNA copy number. GE promoted ATP production, the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and IV, and expression levels of OXPHOS complex related proteins and AMPK/PGC1<U+0251> signaling related proteins. The antagonist of AMPK eliminated partly the effect of GE on mitochondrial biogenesis. 6-Gingerol increased mitochondrial mass, mtDNA copy number and ATP production, and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in HepG2 cells as well. However, both 6-gingerol at high concentration of 200 µM and 6-shogaol at 10 to 200 µM inhibited cell viability. In conclusion, GE promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial functions via activation of AMPK-PGC1<U+0251> signaling pathway, and 6-gingerol other than 6-shogaol, may be the main active component. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is a food seasoning and also used as a medical plant in alternative medicine throughout the world. Here, we demonstrated that ginger extract (GE) promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function via activation of AMPK-PGC1<U+0251> signaling pathway both in mice and in HepG2 cells, and 6-gingerol may be its main active component. Ginger, with anticipated safety, is expected to be a long-term used dietary supplement and be developed into a new remedy for mitochondrial dysfunctional disorders.

Myocardial infarction has been carefully studied in numerous experimental models. Most of these models are based on electrophysiological and functional data, and pay less attention to histological discoveries. During the last decade, treatment using advanced therapies, mainly cell therapy, has prevailed from among all the options to be studied for treating myocardial infarction. In our study we wanted to show the fundamental histological parameters to be evaluated during the development of an infarction on an experimental model as well as treatment with mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue applied intra-lesionally. The fundamental parameters to study in infarcted tissue at the histological level are the cells involved in the inflammatory process (lymphocytes, macrophages and M2, neutrophils, mast cells and plasma cells), neovascularization processes (capillaries and arterioles) and cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes and Purkinje fibers). In our study, we used intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal stem cells into the myocardial infarction area 1 hour after arterial occlusion and allowed 1 month of evolution before analyzing the modifications on the normal tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Acute inflammation was shortened, leading to chronic inflammation with abundant plasma cells and mast cells and complete disappearance of neutrophils. Another benefit was an increase in the number of vessels formed. Cardiomyocytes and Purkinje fibers were better conserved, both from a structural and metabolic point of view, possibly leading to reduced morbidity in the long term. With this study we present the main histological aspects to be evaluated in future assays, complementing or explaining the electrophysiological and functional findings.

We synthesized and evaluated novel 5-[2-(thiophen-2-yl)propan-2-yl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole derivatives as 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11ß-HSD1) inhibitors. Optimization of the thiophene ring and the substituents on the 1,2,4-triazole ring produced 3,4-dicyclopropyl-5-{2-[3-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)thiophen-2-yl]propan-2-yl}-4H-1,2,4-triazole monohydrochloride (9a), which showed potent and selective inhibitory activity against human 11ß-HSD1. Compound 9a was also metabolically stable against human and mouse liver microsomes. Oral administration of 9a to diabetic ob/ob mice lowered corticosterone levels in adipose tissue, and thereby reduced plasma glucose and insulin levels in a dose-dependent manner.

Chronic inflammation is involved in the development of cancer, lifestyle-related diseases, and autoimmune diseases. It also influences the severity of these diseases. Macrophages that accumulate in tumor tissues and adipose tissues of obesity have been shown to increase expression of inflammatory cytokines, thereby inducing inflammatory changes in these tissues. The macrophage phenotype is believed to be important in mediating inflammatory changes in tissues. Recently, monocytes/macrophages activated with low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were demonstrated to suppress increased expression of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1 ß, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a). By suppressing the increased expression of chemotaxis-related and inflammation-related factors, monocytes/macrophages activated with low-dose LPS are considered to suppress the migration of macrophages into tissues and to regulate inflammatory changes in these tissues, respectively. The effects of macrophages activated with low-dose LPS were different from those of macrophages activated with high-dose LPS. In this review, we discuss the usefulness of monocytes/macrophages activation by low-dose LPS.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells capable of differentiating into adipocytic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, and myogenic lineages. There is growing evidence that MSCs home into the tumor microenvironment attracted by a variety of signals such as chemokines, growth factors, and cytokines. Tumor-homing stem cells may originate from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) or adipose tissue-derived MSCs. Recent scientific data suggest that MSCs in combination with tumor cells can either promote or inhibit tumorigenic behavior. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), BMSCs are reported to be enriched with a potential negative role. Here, we evaluated the effect of BMSCs from 4 different donors in combination with 4 HNSCC cell lines in a 3-dimensional multicellular spheroid model. Heterogeneous combinations revealed an up-regulation of gene and protein expression of osteogenic markers runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) together with a substantial secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9. Moreover, heterogenous BMSC/tumor spheroids showed increased invasion compared with homogenous spheroids in a Boyden chamber invasion assay. Furthermore, inhibition of ALP resulted in a substantially decreased spreading of heterogeneous spheroids on laminin-rich matrix. In summary, our data suggest a prometastatic effect of BMSCs combined with HNSCC.-Wessely, A., Waltera, A., Reichert, T. E., Stöckl, S., Grässel, S., Bauer, R. J. Induction of ALP and MMP9 activity facilitate invasive behavior in heterogeneous human BMSC and HNSCC 3D-spheroids.

Mitochondrial uncoupling can be defined as a dissociation between mitochondrial membrane potential generation and its use for mitochondria-dependent ATP synthesis. Although this process was originally considered a mitochondrial dysfunction, the identification of UCP-1 as an endogenous physiological uncoupling protein suggests that the process could be involved in many other biological processes. In this review, we first compare the mitochondrial uncoupling agents available in term of mechanistic and non-specific effects. Proteins regulating mitochondrial uncoupling, as well as chemical compounds with uncoupling properties are discussed. Second, we summarize the most recent findings linking mitochondrial uncoupling and other cellular or biological processes, such as bulk and specific autophagy, reactive oxygen species production, protein secretion, cell death, physical exercise, metabolic adaptations in adipose tissue, and cell signaling. Finally, we show how mitochondrial uncoupling could be used to treat several human diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, or neurological disorders.

The aim of this research was to estimate the preventive effects of filbertone, the main flavor compound in hazelnuts, on lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed chow, a HFD, or a 0.025% filbertone-supplemented HFD for 14 weeks. We found that filbertone supplementation resulted in significant reductions in body weight gain and lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, with parallel improvements in plasma lipid levels (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty acids) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)). Molecular analysis revealed that filbertone treatment led to reprogramming of metabolic signatures in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. Filbertone supplementation significantly increased the cAMP level and increased downstream protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA) signaling in mouse adipose tissue. The mRNA level of adipogenesis-related genes was downregulated in the adipose tissue of filbertone-fed mice compared to control mice fed the HFD alone. Furthermore, filbertone treatment elevated the expression of thermogenic genes in mouse adipose tissue. Filbertone reduced intracellular lipid accumulation and increased the oxygen consumption rate in 3T3-L1 cells and these filbertone-induced changes were abrogated by the adenylate cyclases (ADCY) inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of filbertone on lipid accumulation may be associated with the activation of cAMP signaling.

Wound healing is a complex process with a linear development that involves many actors in a multistep timeline commonly divided into four stages: Hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Chronic non-healing wounds fail to progress beyond the inflammatory phase, thus precluding the next steps and, ultimately, wound repair. Many intrinsic or extrinsic factors may contribute to such an occurrence, including patient health conditions, age-related diseases, metabolic deficiencies, advanced age, mechanical pressure, and infections. Great interest is being focused on the adipose tissue-derived stem cell's (ASC) paracrine activity for its potential therapeutic impact on chronic non-healing wounds. In this review, we summarize the results of in vitro and in vivo experimental studies on the pro-wound healing effects of ASC-secretome and/or extracellular vesicles (EVs). To define an overall picture of the available literature data, experimental conditions and applied methodologies are described as well as the in vitro and in vivo models chosen in the reported studies. Even if a comparative analysis of the results obtained by the different groups is challenging due to the large variability of experimental conditions, the available findings are undoubtedly encouraging and fully support the use of cell-free therapies for the treatment of chronic non-healing wounds.

SCOPE: Dietary protein restriction elicits hyperphagia and increases energy expenditure; however, less is known of whether these responses are a consequence of increasing carbohydrate content. The effects of protein-diluted diets with fixed carbohydrate content on energy balance, hormones, and key markers of protein sensing and thermogenesis in tissues are determined.METHODS AND RESULTS: Obesity-prone rats (n = 13-16 per group) are randomized to diets containing fixed carbohydrate (52% calories) and varying protein concentrations: 15% (control), 10% (mild protein restriction), 5% (moderate protein restriction) or 1% (severe protein restriction) protein calories, or protein-matched to 5% protein, for 21 days. Propranolol and ondansetron are administered to interrogate the roles of sympathetic and serotonergic systems, respectively, in diet-induced changes in energy expenditure. It is found that mild-to-moderate protein restriction promotes transient hyperphagia, whereas severe protein restriction induces hypophagia, with alterations in meal patterns. Protein restriction enhances energy expenditure that is partly attenuated by propranolol, but not ondansetron. Moderate to severe protein restriction decreases gains in body weight, lean and fat mass, decreased postprandial glucose and leptin, but increased fibroblast growth factor-21 concentrations. Protein-matching retains lean mass suggesting that intake of dietary protein, but not calories, is important for preserving lean mass. Notably, protein restriction increases the protein and/or transcript abundance of key amino acid sensing molecules in liver and intestine (PERK, eIF2a, ATF2, CHOP, 4EBP1, FGF21), and upregulated thermogenic markers (ß2AR, Klotho, HADH, UCP-1) in brown adipose tissue.CONCLUSION: Low-protein diets promote hyperphagia and sympathetically mediated increase in energy expenditure, prevent gains in tissue reserves, and concurrently upregulate hepatic and intestinal amino acid sensing intermediaries and thermogenic markers in brown adipose tissue.

With rapid economic development, the prevalence of obesity has increased remarkably worldwide. Obesity can induce a variety of metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease, which significantly endanger the health and welfare of individuals. Brown and beige fat tissues play an important role in thermogenesis in mammals. Recent studies have shown that follistatin (FST) can potentially induce the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, high-fat diet-induced obese mice were injected with follistatin for one week to explore the effects of follistatin on browning and metabolism and to determine the mechanism. The results showed that follistatin suppressed obesity caused by a high-fat diet and increased insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, and subcutaneous fat browning. The beneficial effects remained even after a period of withdrawal. Follistatin promoted secretion of irisin from subcutaneous fat via the AMPK-PGC1a-irisin signal pathway, which induces browning of WAT, and activated the insulin pathway in beige fat thereby promoting metabolism.

Retinal degenerative diseases lead to blindness due to poorly regenerative potential of the retina. Recently, cell therapy is more considered for degenerative diseases. Autologous mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue are a suitable source for this purpose. Therefore, we conducted a stepwise efficient method to differentiate human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) into retinal precursor-like cells in vitro. We compared two differentiation protocols, monolayer and hanging drop cultures. Through the defined medium and 3D hanging drop culture method, we could achieve up to 75% retinal precursor gene expression profile (PAX6, RAX, CHX10, and CRX) from hADSCs. By imitation of in vivo development, for direct conversion of stem cells into retinal cells, the suppression of the BMP, Nodal, and Wnt signaling pathways was carried out by using three small molecules. The hADSCs were primarily differentiated into anterior neuroectodermal cells by expression of OTX2, SIX3, and <U+0392>-TUB III and then the differentiated cells were propelled into the retinal cells. According to our data from real-time PCR, RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and functional assay, it seems that the hanging drop method improved retinal precursor differentiation yield which these precursor-like cells respond to glutamate neurotransmitter. Regarding the easy accessibility and immunosuppressive properties of hADSCs and more efficient hanging drop method, this study may be useful for future autologous cell therapy of retinal degenerative disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is becoming a recognized cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. This study aimed to evaluate body composition, especially VAT, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to explore the association between VAT and SLE disease-related factors.METHOD: Ninety-eight inpatients with SLE and 108 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls were included. Demographic and clinical parameters were recorded. The VAT was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.CONCLUSION: This study suggested that SLE patients had some traditional CV risk factors such as altered body composition and increased VAT. The higher VAT in patients with SLE was associated with traditional cardiometabolic risks, which may contribute to CV events in SLE populations.Key Points Patients with SLE had increased VAT volume and mass than controls. The VAT volume correlated with traditional cardiometabolic risk factors. In SLE patient group, the VAT volume correlated with disease duration, SLICC/ACR-DI, and low serum complementC3/C4, but not with SLEDAI and glucocorticoid dose.

Adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk plays a critical role to regulate adipose tissue microenvironment and cause chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity. Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1ß, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/M2 macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic disorders.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic Cancer remains a lethal disease for the majority of patients. New chemotherapy agents such as Folfirinox offer therapeutic potential for patients who present with Borderline Resectable disease (BRPC). However, results to date are inconsistent, with factors such as malnutrition limiting successful drug delivery. We sought to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in BRPC patients at diagnosis, and to quantify body composition change during chemotherapy.METHODS: The diagnostic/restaging CT scans of BRPC patients were analysed. Body composition was measured at L3 using Tomovision Slice-O-Matic. Total muscle and adipose tissue mass were estimated using validated regression equations. Sarcopenia was defined as per gender- and body mass index (BMI)-specific lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI) and muscle attenuation reference values.RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, and 67 patients underwent restaging CT, at which point a third were deemed resectable. Half were sarcopenic at diagnosis, and sarcopenia was equally prevalent across all BMI categories.. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (intra-muscular, visceral and sub-cutaneous) area decreased during chemotherapy (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.0001). Low muscle attenuation was observed in half of patients at diagnosis, and was associated with increased mortality risk. Loss of lean tissue parameters during chemotherapy was associated with an increased mortality risk; specifically fat-free mass, HR 1.1 (95% CI 1.03-1.17, p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.003) and skeletal muscle mass, HR 1.21 (95%CI 1.08-1.35, p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia was prevalent in half of patients at the time of diagnosis with BRPC. Low muscle attenuation at diagnosis, coupled with lean tissue loss during chemotherapy, independently increased mortality risk.

Recently, astaxanthin, a red lipophilic pigment belonging to the xanthophyllic family of carotenoids, has shown the feasibility of its uses in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, due to its excellent antioxidant activities and its abilities to enhance the self-renewal potency of stem cells. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of astaxanthin on the proliferation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in tissue-engineered constructs. The tissue engineered scaffolds were fabricated using photopolymerizable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) with different concentrations of astaxanthin. The effects of astaxanthin on cellular proliferation in two-dimensional environments were assessed using alamar blue assay and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Then, rheological properties, chemical structures and the water absorption of the fabricated astaxanthin-incorporated GelMA hydrogels were characterized using NMR analysis, rheological analysis and a swelling ratio test. Finally, the influence in three-dimensional environments of astaxanthin-incorporated GelMA hydrogels on the proliferative potentials of adipose-derived stem cells was assessed using alamar blue assay and the confocal imaging with Live/dead staining. The experimental results of the study indicate that an addition of astaxanthin promises to induce stem cell potency via proliferation, and that it can be a useful tool for a three-dimensional culture system and various tissue engineering applications.

The accumulation of excess white adipose tissue (WAT) has harmful consequences on metabolic health. WAT browning confers beneficial effects on adiposity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In this study, it was found out that circNrxn2 sponged miR-103 and enhanced FGF10 levels in HFD mice WAT. We discovered that circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning and mitochondria functions. Furthermore, circNrxn2 also increased M2 macrophage polarization in HFD mouse adipose tissue, and the PPAR<U+03B3> signaling pathway participated in these biological processes. Moreover, eliminating adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) by clodronate-crippled circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning, and the simulation co-culture of macrophages and adipocytes results suggested that circNrxn2 promoted WAT browning through increasing M2 macrophage polarization. Our finding revealed that circNrxn2 acted as an endogenous miR-103 sponge, blocked miR-103 effects, and relieved its inhibition of FGF10 expression to promote WAT browning through increasing M2 macrophage polarization. This study provides a good therapeutic strategy for treating obesity and improving obesity-related metabolic disorders.

Leptin administration into the hindbrain, and specifically the nucleus of the solitary tract, increases phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3), a marker of leptin receptor activation, in hypothalamic nuclei known to express leptin receptors. The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) shows the greatest response with a three-fold increase in pSTAT3. This experiment tested the importance of VMH leptin responsiveness in mediating weight loss caused by fourth ventricle (4V) leptin infusion. Male Sprague Dawley rats received bilateral VMH 75 nl injections of 260 ng/ml of leptin-conjugated saporin (Lep-Sap) or Blank-Saporin (Blk-Sap). After 23 days they were fitted with 4V infusion cannula and one week later adapted to housing in a calorimeter before they were infused with 0.9 mg leptin/day for 14 days. There was no effect of VMH Lep-Sap on weight gain or glucose clearance before leptin infusion. Leptin inhibited food intake and respiratory exchange ratio in Blk-Sap, but not Lep-Sap rats. Leptin had no effect on energy expenditure or brown adipose tissue temperature of either group. Inguinal and epididymal fat were significantly reduced in leptin-treated Blk-Sap rats, but the response was greatly attenuated in Lep-Sap rats. VMH pSTAT3 was increased in leptin-treated Blk-Sap, but not Lep-Sap rats. These results support the concept that leptin-induced weight loss results from an integrated response across different brain areas. They also support previous reports that VMH leptin receptors do not play a significant role in maintaining energy balance in basal conditions, but limit weight gain during positive energy balance.

Adaptive induction of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is essential for the survival of mammals after birth. We herein show that G-coupled receptor protein-120 (GPR120) expression is dramatically induced after birth in mouse BAT. GPR120 expression in neonatal BAT is the highest among GPR120-expressing tissues in mouse at any developmental stage tested. The induction of GPR120 in neonatal BAT is caused by the postnatal thermal stress rather than by the initiation of suckling. GPR120-null neonates were found to be relatively intolerant to cold: close to one-third did not survive at 21ºC, but all such pups survived at 25ºC. Heat production in BAT was significantly impaired in GPR120-null pups. Deficiency in GPR120 did not modify brown adipocyte morphology or the anatomical architecture of BAT, as assessed by electron microscopy, but instead impaired the expression of UCP1 and the fatty acid oxidation capacity of neonatal BAT. Moreover, GPR120 deficiency impaired FGF21 gene expression in BAT and reduced plasma FGF21 levels. These results indicate that GPR120 is essential for neonatal adaptive thermogenesis through the control of the FGF21 system.

OBJECTIVE: Surgical manipulations of adipose tissue by removal, or partial lipectomy, have demonstrated body fat compensation and recovered body weight, suggesting that the body is able to resist changes to body composition. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are not well understood. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an update on what is currently known about the regulation of energetics and body fat after surgical manipulations of adipose tissue in small mammals.METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were searched to identify 64 eligible studies. Outcome measures included body fat, body weight, food intake, and circulating biomarkers.RESULTS: Surgeries performed included lipectomy (72%) or transplantation (12%) in mice (35%), rats (35%), and other small mammals. Findings suggested that lipectomy did not have consistent long-term effects on reducing body weight and fat because regain occurred within 12 to 14 weeks post surgery. Hence, biological feedback mechanisms act to resist long-term changes of body weight or fat. Furthermore, whether this weight and fat regain occurred because of &quot;passive&quot; and &quot;active&quot; regulation under the &quot;set point&quot; or &quot;settling point&quot; theories cannot fully be discerned because of limitations in study designs and data collected.CONCLUSIONS: The regulation of energetics and body fat are complex and dynamic processes that require further studies of the interplay of genetic, physiological, and behavioral factors.

Surgery of the chest wall is potentially required to cover large defects after  removal of malignant tumours. Usually, inert and non-degradable Gore-Tex serves to replace the missing tissue. However, novel biodegradable materials combined with stem cells are available that stimulate the healing. Based on poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles (PLGA/aCaP) and pure PLGA, a dual layer biodegradable hybrid nanocomposite was generated. Mouse adipose-derived stem cells were cultered on electrospun disks (ASCs of C57BL/6), and biomechanical tests were performed. The cell-seeded scaffolds were engrafted in C57BL/LY5.1 mice to serve as a chest wall substitute. Cell invasion into the bi-layered material, extent of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, inflammatory response, neo-vascularization and ECM composition were determined at 1 and 2 months post-surgery, respectively. The bi-layered hybrid nanocomposite was stable after a 2-week in vitro culture, in contrast to PLGA/aCaP without a PLGA layer. There was a complete biointegration and good vascularization in vivo. The presence of ASCs attracted more CD45<sup>+</sup> cells (hematopoietic origin) compared to cell-free scaffolds. Inflammatory reaction was similar for both groups (±ASCs) at 8 weeks. A bi-layered hybrid nanocomposite fabricated of electrospun PLGA/aCaP and a reinforcing layer of pristine PLGA is an ideal scaffold for chest wall reconstruction. It is stable and allows a proper host tissue integration. If ASCs are seeded, they attract more CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, supporting the regeneration process.

Sow litter sizes have increased, subjecting more small piglets to intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). Research on the development and growth of IUGR pigs is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the body composition and organ development of IUGR pigs at weaning, and to estimate their growth performance from birth to 30 kg. A total of 142 IUGR and 142 normal piglets were classified at birth based on their head morphology. At weaning, 20 IUGR and 20 normal piglets were collected, a whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorption scan was performed, and the piglets were euthanized for organ measurements. Body weight (BW) was measured weekly from birth to 30 kg, rectal temperature and whole-blood glucose levels were measured weekly from birth to weaning, and blood samples were collected at days 7, 14 and 21 for IGF-1 analysis. Results showed that IUGR pigs have a similar percentage of adipose tissue (P &amp;gt; 0.05) compared to normal pigs at 24 days of age. Organs were smaller (P 0.05) from weaning to 30 kg. Rectal temperature of IUGR piglets was greater (P 0.05) between IUGR and normal piglets. In conclusion, IUGR piglets exhibited some relatively larger organs at weaning compared to normal pigs, but body composition was similar between IUGR and normal pigs. In addition, IUGR pigs had a reduced ADG from birth to 30 kg, and, although they exhibited a greater FADG during nursing, IUGR pigs still require six additional days to reach a BW of 30 kg in comparison to normal pigs.

BACKGROUND: The diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most prevalent complications of diabetes mellitus and often develops severe effects that can lead to amputation. A non-healing &quot;minor&quot; amputation often precedes a major amputation resulting in a negative impact on the function and quality of life of the patients. Stem cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising option to improve healing, and the adipose tissue is an abundant and easy to access source. The injection of autologous micro-fragmented adipose tissue at the amputation stump of a diabetic population undergoing a lower limb minor amputation was evaluated and compared with the standard care.METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial with two arms (parallel assignment) and no masking, 114 patients undergoing a lower limb minor amputation were randomized to standard of care or to micro-fragmented adipose tissue injection prepared using a minimal manipulation technique (Lipogems®) in a closed system. Clinical outcomes were determined monthly up to 6<U+2009>months. Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of the healing rate and time after the minor amputation. Secondary endpoints included the assessment of safety, feasibility, technical success, relapse rate, skin tropism, and intensity of pain.RESULTS: At 6<U+2009>months, 80% of the micro-fragmented adipose tissue-treated feet healed and 20% failed as compared with the control group where 46% healed and 54% failed (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0064). No treatment-related adverse events nor relapses were documented, and technical success was achieved in all cases. The skin tropism was improved in the treatment group, and the pain scale did not differ between the two groups.CONCLUSION: The results of this randomized controlled trial suggest that the local injection of autologous micro-fragmented adipose tissue is a safe and valid therapeutic option able to improve healing rate following minor amputations of irreversible DFU. The technique overcomes several stem cell therapy-related criticisms and its potential in wound care should be better evaluated and the therapeutic indications could be expanded.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT03276312.

Sarcopenia is the main constituent of malnutrition and is a frequent complication of chronic liver diseases, which affects up to 70% of patients with advanced liver diseases. It has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes and prognosis, including poor quality of life, development of other complications and reduction in survival rate of non-transplant patients and transplant recipients. Chronic liver disease causes alteration in glucose metabolism, lipid oxidation, ketogenesis and protein catabolism, leading to the loss of adipose and muscle tissue. In addition, inadequate nutrients intake and limited or lack of physical activity perpetuate the reduction of muscle mass. Recently, the roles and mechanisms of muscle growth-related hormones, hyperammonemia-mediated signaling pathways and gut microbiota have been recognized. In view of its impact in chronic liver disease, sarcopenia can be considered as a powerful prognostic factor and a useful additional tool in the global assessment of patients with advanced liver disease. Rational nutritional intervention, appropriate physical exercise, effective ammonia lowering strategies, hormone supplements and targeted molecular therapy (use of myostatin blockers), and liver transplantation, may improve sarcopenia, but still needs more studies for validation.

Breast cancer often results in the removal of the breast, creating a need for replacement tissue. Tissue engineering offers the promise of generating such replacements by combining cells with biomaterial scaffolds and serves as an attractive potential alternative to current surgical repair methods. Such engineered tissues can also serve as important tools for drug screening and provide in vitro models for analysis. 3D bioprinting serves as an exciting technology with significant implications and applications in the field of tissue engineering. Here we review the work that has been undertaken in hopes of generating the recognized in-demand replacement breast tissue using different types of bioprinting. We then offer suggestions for future work needed to advance this field for both in vitro and in vivo applications.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) bioaccumulate in the food chain and have been detected in human blood and adipose tissue. Experimental studies demonstrated that POPs can cause and promote growth of breast cancer. However, inconsistent results from epidemiological studies do not support a causal relationship between POPs and breast cancer in women. To identify individual POPs that are repeatedly found to be associated with both breast cancer incidence and progression, and to demystify the observed inconsistencies between epidemiological studies, we conducted a systematic review of 95 studies retrieved from three main electronic databases. While no clear pattern of associations between blood POPs and breast cancer incidence could be drawn, POPs measured in breast adipose tissue were more clearly associated with higher breast cancer incidence. POPs were more consistently associated with worse breast cancer prognosis whether measured in blood or breast adipose tissue. In contrast, POPs measured in adipose tissue other than breast were inversely associated with both breast cancer incidence and prognosis. Differences in biological tissues used for POPs measurement and methodological biases explain the discrepancies between studies results. Some individual compounds associated with both breast cancer incidence and progression, deserve further investigation.

Obesity causes various health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. Metabolic organs, particularly white adipose tissue (WAT) and liver, are deeply involved in obesity. WAT contains many adipocytes with energy storage capacity and secretes adipokines depending on the obesity state, while liver plays pivotal roles in glucose and lipid metabolism. This review outlines and underscores the relationship between obesity and lysosomal functions, including lysosome biogenesis, maturation and activity of lysosomal proteases in WAT and liver. It has been revealed that obesity-induced abnormalities of lysosomal proteases contribute to inflammation and cellular senescence in adipocytes. Previous reports have demonstrated obesity-induced ectopic lipid accumulation in liver is associated with abnormality of lysosomal proteases as well as other lysosomal enzymes. These studies demonstrate that lysosomal dysfunction in WAT and liver underlies part of the obesity-related pathology, raising the possibility that strategies to modulate lysosomal function may be effective in preventing or treating the metabolic syndrome.

Obesity is considered to significantly increase the risk of the development of a vast range of metabolic diseases. However, adipogenesis is a complex physiological process, necessary to sequester lipids effectively to avoid lipotoxicity in other tissues, like the liver, heart, muscle, essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and has a crucial role as a component of the innate immune system, far beyond than only being an inert mass of energy storage. In pathophysiological conditions, adipogenesis promotes a pro-inflammatory state, angiogenesis and the release of adipokines, which become dangerous to health. It results in a hypoxic state, causing oxidative stress and the synthesis and release of harmful free fatty acids. In this review, we try to explain the mechanisms occurring at the breaking point, at which adipogenesis leads to an uncontrolled lipotoxicity. This review highlights the types of adipose tissue and their functions, their way of storing lipids until a critical point, which is associated with hypoxia, inflammation, insulin resistance as well as lipodystrophy and adipogenesis modulation by Krüppel-like factors and miRNAs.

Bisphenol A (BPA) and its chlorinated derivatives (Clx-BPA) are environmental pollutants exhibiting endocrine-disrupting (ED) properties suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers. Due to their lipophilic properties, they may accumulate in adipose tissue which could therefore be a suitable matrix to assess long-term exposure to these compounds and relationships with the tumorigenesis of these cancers. An LC-MS/MS assay for the determination of BPA and Clx-BPA in adipose tissue samples was developed and fully validated according to current bioanalytical validation guidelines. Ionization was achieved using an electrospray source operating in the negative mode and quantification of target analytes was obtained in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Both standard and quality control (QC) samples were prepared in blank adipose tissue samples. Linearity was demonstrated over the ranges 0.125 to 8.000 and 0.0125-0.8000<U+202F>ng/mL for BPA and Clx-BPA, respectively. Accuracy and precision were demonstrated over the whole concentration range: intra and inter-day bias values were in the 85-114% range and imprecision of the method did not exceed 14%. Lower limits of quantification were validated using QCs at 0.1250 and 0.0125<U+202F>ng/mL for BPA and Clx-BPA, respectively. Internal standard-corrected matrix effects were comparable in breast and prostate adipose tissues, demonstrating that this method could be used to reliably assay BPA and Clx-BPA in both tissues. The method was sensitive enough to determine BPA and Clx-BPA in breast adipose tissue obtained from women undergoing breast surgery, enabling identification of different patterns of exposure to these ED chemicals. The method enables the reliable quantification of BPA and Clx-BPA in adipose tissue and could be used to assess long-term exposure to these compounds and potential associations with hormone-dependent cancers.

Fine-tuning of transcriptional responses can be critical for long-term outcomes in response to an environmental challenge. The circadian protein Nocturnin belongs to a family of proteins that include exonucleases, endonucleases, and phosphatases and is most closely related to the CCR4 family of deadenylases that regulate the cellular transcriptome via control of poly(A) tail length of RNA transcripts. In this study, we investigate the role of Nocturnin in regulating the transcriptional response and downstream metabolic adaptations during cold exposure in brown adipose tissue. We find that Nocturnin exhibits dual localization within the cytosol and mitochondria, and loss of Nocturnin causes changes in expression of networks of mRNAs involved in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, Nocturnin<sup>-/-</sup> animals display significantly elevated levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, indicating that they have distinct metabolic adaptations during a prolonged cold exposure. We conclude that cold-induced stimulation of Nocturnin levels can regulate long-term metabolic adaptations to environmental challenges.

Ageing populations pose one of the main public health crises of our time. Reprogramming gene expression by altering the activities of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) can ameliorate deleterious effects of age. Here we explore how a circuit of TFs coordinates pro-longevity transcriptional outcomes, which reveals a multi-tissue and multi-species role for an entire protein family: the E-twenty-six (ETS) TFs. In Drosophila, reduced insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) extends lifespan by coordinating activation of Aop, an ETS transcriptional repressor, and Foxo, a Forkhead transcriptional activator. Aop and Foxo bind the same genomic loci, and we show that, individually, they effect similar transcriptional programmes in vivo. In combination, Aop can both moderate or synergise with Foxo, dependent on promoter context. Moreover, Foxo and Aop oppose the gene-regulatory activity of Pnt, an ETS transcriptional activator. Directly knocking down Pnt recapitulates aspects of the Aop/Foxo transcriptional programme and is sufficient to extend lifespan. The lifespan-limiting role of Pnt appears to be balanced by a requirement for metabolic regulation in young flies, in which the Aop-Pnt-Foxo circuit determines expression of metabolic genes, and Pnt regulates lipolysis and responses to nutrient stress. Molecular functions are often conserved amongst ETS TFs, prompting us to examine whether other Drosophila ETS-coding genes may also affect ageing. We show that five out of eight Drosophila ETS TFs play a role in fly ageing, acting from a range of organs and cells including the intestine, adipose and neurons. We expand the repertoire of lifespan-limiting ETS TFs in C. elegans, confirming their conserved function in ageing and revealing that the roles of ETS TFs in physiology and lifespan are conserved throughout the family, both within and between species.

BACKGROUND: Dermal necrosis is a rare yet serious risk associated with cosmetic filler injections, and although current consensus recommends the use of hyaluronidase injections in cases of hyaluronic acid filler, the efficacy of topical nitroglycerin as a treatment has not yet been fully investigated.OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on tissue necrosis resulting from soft tissue augmentation and to highlight the use of topical nitroglycerin as a first-line treatment.METHODS: A review of the literature was performed with no time limitations resulting in 35 articles and 66 patients who experienced tissue necrosis secondary to injectable fillers. Articles were reviewed for pertinent information and presented.RESULTS: Only 7 of the 66 reported cases (10%) used topical nitroglycerin as a treatment. Six of 7 (85%) were successful in halting the impending necrosis. Fifty-nine patients received alternative treatments, with hyaluronidase injection being the most common. Few reports of novel treatments for necrosis included the use of topical growth factors and injection of adipose-derived stem cells.CONCLUSION: Topical nitroglycerin is a potentially effective and underused treatment for tissue necrosis from soft tissue augmentation, but because data are very limited, topical nitroglycerin should be used in conjunction with hyaluronidase injections in cases of hyaluronic acid filler dermal necrosis.

BACKGROUND: The quantity and distribution of adipose tissue may be prognostic measures of mortality in colorectal cancer patients and such associations may vary by patient sex.METHODS: This cohort included 3,262 stage I-III colorectal cancer patients. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues were quantified using computed tomography. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic splines estimated statistical associations with two-sided P values.RESULTS: Visceral adipose tissue was prognostic of mortality in a reverse L-shaped pattern (nonlinear P=0.02); risk flat to a threshold (260<U+2009>cm2), then increased linearly. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was prognostic of mortality in a J-shaped pattern (nonlinear P&lt;0.001); risk was higher at extreme (&lt;50<U+2009>cm2) but lower at intermediate values (&gt;50 to<U+2009>=<U+2009>560<U+2009>cm2). Patient sex modified the prognostic associations between visceral adipose tissue (Pinteraction=0.049) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (Pinteraction=0.04) with mortality. Among men, visceral adiposity was associated with mortality in a J-shaped pattern (nonlinear P=0.003), whereas among women, visceral adiposity was associated with mortality in a linear pattern (linear P=0.008). Among men, subcutaneous adiposity was associated with mortality in an L-shaped pattern (nonlinear P=0.01), whereas among women, subcutaneous adiposity was associated with mortality in a J-shaped pattern (nonlinear P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were prognostic of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer; the shape of these associations were often nonlinear and varied by patient sex. These results offer insight into the potential biological mechanisms that link obesity with clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, suggesting that the dysregulated deposition of excess adiposity is prognostic of mortality.

The high prevalence of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases has heightened the importance of understanding control of adipose tissue development and energy metabolism. In mammals, 3 types of adipocytes with different characteristics and origins have been identified: white, brown, and beige. Beige and brown adipocytes contain numerous mitochondria and have the capability to burn energy and counteract obesity, while white adipocytes store energy and are closely associated with metabolic disorders and obesity. Thus, regulation of the development and function of different adipocytes is important for controlling energy balance and combating obesity and related metabolic disorders. Melatonin is a neurohormone, which plays multiple roles in regulating inflammation, blood pressure, insulin actions, and energy metabolism. This article summarizes and discusses the role of melatonin in white, beige, and brown adipocytes, especially in affecting adipogenesis, inducing beige formation or white adipose tissue browning, enhancing brown adipose tissue mass and activities, improving anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects, regulating adipokine secretion, and preventing body weight gain. Based on the current findings, melatonin is a potential therapeutic agent to control energy metabolism, adipogenesis, fat deposition, adiposity, and related metabolic diseases.

Cytophagic histolytic panniculitis (CHP) is a clinical disorder characterized by nodular panniculitis of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. It was first described in 1980 by Winkelmann. Histologically it is described as an infiltration of the adipose tissue by T- lymphocytes and phagocytic macrophages (also known as &quot;bean bag cells&quot;). Most of the cases are reported under the age of 50 and is a rare cause of panniculitis.

Adipose tissue has been considered as a crucial source of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines; conversely, these pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of adipocytes, promoting lipolysis, inhibiting lipid synthesis and decreasing blood lipids, etc. In recent decades, extensive studies have indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokines play important roles in the development of lipid metabolism of metabolic diseases, including obesity, atherosclerosis, steatohepatitis and hyperlipoproteinemia. However, the involved pro-inflammatory cytokines types and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The &quot;re-discovery&quot; of cancer as a metabolic disorder largely occurred in the last five years. Although pro-inflammatory cytokines have been intensively investigated in cancer research, there are very few studies about the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lipid metabolism of cancer. In the current review, we provide an overview of the progress that has been made in the roles of different pro-inflammatory cytokines in lipid metabolism of metabolic diseases including cancer.

This study examined the effect of pre-germinated brown rice extract (PGBRE), containing no dietary fibers, but <U+03B3>-oryzanol, <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid (GABA), flavonoids, and anthocyanidin, on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome. C57BL/6 mice were divided into five groups: regular diet, HFD, HFD with oral PGBRE 30, 300, or 600 mg/kg per day for 18 weeks. In the HFD group, higher body and liver weight gain, hyperglycemia, HbA1c, and insulin; higher TG, TC, LDL-C, non-HDL, atherosclerosis index, lower HDL, adiponectin in blood; higher TG in the liver; higher TG, bile acid in feces; and lower protein levels of AMP-activated protein kinase, insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, insulin receptor substrate-2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3>, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, Akt/PKB, glucose transporter-1, glucose transporter-4, glucokinase in the skeletal muscle; lower glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in the intestine; higher sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and lower PPAR-a, low-density lipoprotein receptor, cholesterol-7a-hydroxylase in the liver; higher SREBP-1, SCD-1, FAS, and lower PPAR-a, adiponectin in the adipose tissue were found. In HFD + PGBRE groups, the above biochemical parameters were improved. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: According to the results, we suggested that dietary fibers played a minor role in this study. Extract of PGBR, excluding dietary fiber, showed beneficial activity to ameliorate metabolic syndrome. <U+03B3>-oryzanol, GABA, flavonoids, and anthocyanidin in PGBRE can inhibit HFD-induced metabolic syndrome and we demonstrated clearly its action mechanisms. This is the first report to examine the relation between PGBRE, GLP-1, and PCSK9. Taken together, PGBRE can potentially be used to develop a good supplement to control metabolic syndrome.

The National Institute on Aging (NIA)-sponsored Interventions Testing Program (ITP) has identified a number of dietary drug interventions that significantly extend lifespan, including rapamycin, acarbose, and 17-a estradiol. However, these drugs have diverse downstream targets, and their effects on age-associated organ-specific changes are unclear (1). Potential mechanisms by which these drugs extend life could be through their effect on inflammatory processes often noted in tissues of aging mice and humans. Our study focuses on the effects of three drugs in the ITP on inflammation in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) of HET3 mice-including adiposity, adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) M1/M2 polarization, markers of cellular senescence and endoplasmic reticulum stress. We found that rapamycin led to a 56% increase of CD45+ leukocytes in gWAT, where the majority of these are ATMs. Interestingly, rapamycin led to a 217% and 106% increase of M1 (CD45+CD64+CD206-) ATMs in females and males, respectively. Our data suggest rapamycin may achieve lifespan extension in part through adipose tissue inflammation. Additionally, HET3 mice exhibit a spectrum of age-associated changes in the gWAT, but acarbose and 17-a estradiol do not strongly alter these phenotypes-suggesting that acarbose and 17- a estradiol may not influence lifespan through mechanisms involving adipose tissue inflammation.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea increases obesity risk by an unclear mechanism. Here, we explored the effects of upper airway obstruction and its removal on respiratory homeostasis, energy expenditure, and feeding hormones during the sleep/wake cycle from weaning to adulthood.METHODS: The tracheas of 22-day-old rats were narrowed, and obstruction removal was performed on post-surgery day 14. Energy expenditure, ventilation, and hormone-regulated feeding were analyzed during 49 days before and after obstruction.RESULTS: Energy expenditure increased and body temperature decreased in upper airway obstruction and was only partially recovered in obstruction removal despite normalization of airway resistance. Increased energy expenditure was associated with up-regulation of ventilation. Decreased body temperature was associated with decreased brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein 1 level, suppressed energy expenditure response to norepinephrine, and decreased leptin level. Upper airway obstructed animals added less body weight, in spite of an increase in food intake, due to elevated hypothalamic orexin and neuropeptide Y and plasma ghrelin. Animals who underwent obstruction removal fed more due to an increase in hypothalamic neuropeptide Y and plasma ghrelin.CONCLUSIONS: The need to maintain respiratory homeostasis is associated with persistent abnormal energy metabolism and hormonal regulation of feeding. Surgical treatment per se may not be sufficient to correct energy homeostasis, and endocrine regulation of feeding may have a larger effect on weight change.

Distinct oxygenases and their oxylipin products have been shown to participate in thermogenesis by mediating physiological adaptations required to sustain body temperature. Since the role of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family in cold adaptation remains elusive, we aimed to investigate whether, and how, LOX activity is required for cold adaptation and to identify LOX-derived lipid mediators that could serve as putative cold mimetics with therapeutic potential to combat diabetes. By utilizing mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics in mice and humans, we demonstrated that cold and ß3-adrenergic stimulation could promote the biosynthesis and release of 12-LOX metabolites from brown adipose tissue (BAT). Moreover, 12-LOX ablation in mouse brown adipocytes impaired glucose uptake and metabolism, resulting in blunted adaptation to the cold in vivo. The cold-induced 12-LOX product 12-HEPE was found to be a batokine that improves glucose metabolism by promoting glucose uptake into adipocytes and skeletal muscle through activation of an insulin-like intracellular signaling pathway.

Adipose tissue is located in discrete depots that are differentially associated with elevated risk of metabolic complications, with fat accretion in visceral depots being most detrimental to metabolic health. Currently, the regulation of specific adipose depot expansion, by adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and consequently fat distribution, is not well understood. However, a growing body of evidence from in vitro investigations indicates that mature adipocytes secrete factors that modulate the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor, adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). It is therefore plausible that endocrine communication between adipocytes and ADSCs located in different depots influences fat distribution, and may therefore contribute to the adverse health outcomes associated with visceral adiposity. This review will explore the available evidence of paracrine and endocrine crosstalk between mature adipocytes and ADSCs that affects adipogenesis, as a better understanding of the regulatory roles of the extracellular signalling mechanisms within- and between adipose depots may profoundly change the way we view adipose tissue growth in obesity and related comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE: The T-box gene Tbx15 is abundantly expressed in adipose tissues, especially subcutaneous and brown fat. Although its expression is correlated with obesity, its precise biological role in adipose tissue is poorly understood in vivo. Here we investigated the function of Tbx15 in brown adipose thermogenesis and white adipose browning in vivo.METHODS: In the present study, we generated adipose-specific Tbx15 knockout (AKO) mice by crossing Tbx15 floxed mice with adiponectin-Cre mice to delineate Tbx15 function in adipose tissues. We systematically investigated the influence of Tbx15 on brown adipose thermogenesis and white adipose browning in mice, as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanism.RESULTS: Upon cold exposure, adipocyte browning in inguinal adipose tissue was significantly impaired in Tbx15 AKO mice. Furthermore, ablation of Tbx15 blocked adipocyte browning induced by ß3 adrenergic agonist CL 316243, which did not appear to alter the expression of Tbx15. Analysis of DNA binding sites using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that TBX15 bound directly to a key region in the Prdm16 promoter, indicating it regulates transcription of Prdm16, the master gene for adipocyte thermogenesis and browning. Compared to control mice, Tbx15 AKO mice displayed increased body weight gain and decreased whole body energy expenditure in response to high fat diets.CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings suggest that Tbx15 regulates adipocyte browning and might be a potential target for the treatment of obesity.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Obesity is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. In mice, a high-fat diet (HFD) and expression of oncogenic KRAS lead to development of invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by unknown mechanisms. We investigated how oncogenic KRAS regulates the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a metabolic regulator that prevents obesity, and the effects of recombinant human FGF21 (rhFGF21) on pancreatic tumorigenesis.CONCLUSIONS: Normal acinar cells from mice and humans express high levels of FGF21. In mice, acinar expression of oncogenic KRAS significantly reduces FGF21 expression. When these mice are placed on a HFD, they develop extensive inflammation, pancreatic cysts, PanINs, and PDACs, which are reduced by injection of FGF21. FGF21 also reduces the GTP binding capacity of RAS. FGF21 might be used in prevention or treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Fatty acid oxidation is a central fueling pathway for mitochondrial ATP production. Regulation occurs through multiple nutrient- and energy-sensitive molecular mechanisms. We explored if upregulated mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) may be used as a surrogate marker of increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, by indicating an overall shift from glucose to fatty acids as the preferred oxidation fuel. The association between fatty acid oxidation and PDK4 expression was studied in different contexts of metabolic adaption. In rats treated with the modified fatty acid tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), Pdk4 was upregulated simultaneously with fatty acid oxidation genes in liver and heart, whereas muscle and white adipose tissue remained unaffected. In MDA-MB-231 cells, fatty acid oxidation increased nearly three-fold upon peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa, PPARA) overexpression, and four-fold upon TTA-treatment. PDK4 expression was highly increased under these conditions. Further, overexpression of PDK4 caused increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. Pharmacological activators of PPARa and AMPK had minor effects, while the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin potentiated the effect of TTA. There were minor changes in mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic function, and mitochondrial biogenesis under conditions of increased fatty acid oxidation. TTA was found to act as a mild uncoupler, which is likely to contribute to the metabolic effects. Repeated experiments with HeLa cells supported these findings. In summary, PDK4 upregulation implies an overarching metabolic shift towards increased utilization of fatty acids as energy fuel, and thus constitutes a sensitive marker of enhanced fatty acid oxidation.

BACKGROUND AIMS: Tissue engineering technology is a promising therapeutic strategy in peripheral nerve injury. Schwann cells (SCs) are deemed to be a vital component of cell-based nerve regeneration therapies. Many methods for producing SC-like cells derived from adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) have been explored, but their phenotypic and functional characteristics remain unsatisfactory.METHODS: We investigated whether human ADSCs can be induced to differentiate into mature and stable SC-like cells with the addition of insulin, progestero``ne and glucocorticoids. The phenotypic and functional characteristics of new differentiated ADSCs (modified SC-like cells) were evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunocytochemistry in vitro. Cells loaded into collagen sponge biomaterials were implanted around transected sciatic nerves with a 10-mm gap in vivo. The axon regrowth and functional recovery of the regenerated nerves were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Walking footprint analysis.RESULTS: After differentiation induction, the modified SC-like cells showed significantly up-regulated levels of S100B and P0 and enhanced proliferative and migratory capacities. In addition, the modified SC-like cells showed increased secretion of neurotrophic factors, and their functional characteristics were maintained for more than 3 weeks after removing the induction reagents. The modified SC-like cells exhibited significantly enhanced axon regrowth, myelination and functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggest that this modified induction method can induce human ADSCs to differentiate into cells with the molecular and functional properties of mature SCs and increase the promotion of peripheral nerve regeneration.

Dear Editor, Acrochordons are common benign neoplasms found in everyday practice. We present a rare case of a giant and single acrochordon on the lumbar region with signs of ischemia. The correlation of clinical, dermatoscopic, and histopathological analyses may help the clinician differentiate this entity from other benign and malignant dermatoses. A 33-year-old man presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of a lumbar mass that had been growing for two years. The lesion was asymptomatic except for recent discomfort when lying in the supine decubitus position. On examination there was a single, erythematous, non-tender pedunculated lesion, 5.1 cm × 4 cm × 3.2 cm in size, with flaccid bullae on its surface and firm consistency (Figure 1, a-b). Dermoscopy showed regularly arranged dotted vessels in a violaceous background and bullae filled with serous fluid (Figure 1, c-d). His personal and family medical history were unremarkable. Shave excision was performed and the sample was sent for histopathologic analysis. Histopathology revealed a normal epidermis surrounding a core of loose collagen fibers. Papillary dermis showed a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes. Scattered clusters of adipocytes were found in the deep dermis (Figure 2). The diagnosis of a giant ischemic acrochordon was established. Acrochordons, also commonly known as skin tags, are benign pedunculated neoplasms frequently found on the neck, axillae, or groin. They represent fibroepithelial polyps that originate from ectoderm and mesoderm tissue (1). They can be pigmented or skin colored and usually range between 2 to 5 mm in size. Skin tags can affect nearly 46% of the general population (2). Giant and solitary acrochordons are an uncommon clinical variant (2). Differential diagnosis of this pathology may be challenging in the particular clinical context of this patient. Benign neoplasms such as dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, and epidermal inclusion cysts can be clinically similar to giant skin tags (1,2). Histopathological analyses of acrochordons usually show papillomatosis, irregular acanthosis, loose collagen fibers, and dilated capillaries (2). A fibrolipomatous variant of acrochordon may reveal adipose tissue lobules between septa of collagen on pathological examination (1). Local ischemia due to twisting of the stalk may induce the formation of intradermal or subepidermal blisters in these tumors. Histopathologic characteristics found in ischemic acrochordons are neutrophil infiltration, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes (3). Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus (FeP) is a rare variant of basal cell carcinoma that may clinically mimic benign polypoid tumors and has a certain predilection for the lumbosacral area. Dermoscopic characteristics of fibroepithelioma of Pinkus that may aid the clinician in this diagnosis are fine arborizing vessels, either alone or associated with dotted vessels, and white streaks (4). Cosmetically adequate treatment of a giant acrochordon can be performed by shave excision and electrodesiccation of its pedicle. Choudhary et al. reported good results with this technique on a giant acrochordon on the thigh (5).

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have surfaced as ideal candidates for treatment of different therapeutically challenging diseases however their effect on cancer cells is not well determined. In this study, we investigated the effect of MSCs derived from human bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), and umbilical cord derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) on ovarian cancer.Measurements of ovarian tumor marker proteins were computed by ELISA. Proliferative, apoptosis and anti-inflammatory effects of the MSCs were measured by Flow cytometry (FCM). MMPs expression was measured by RT-PCR.The co-culture of cancer cell lines OVCAR3, CAOV3, IGROV3 and SKOV3 with the conditioned media of MSCs (CM-MSC) and MSCs showed an increase in cellular apoptosis, along with a reduction in the level of CA-125 and a decline of LDH and beta-hCG. A decrease in CD24 of the cancer cell lines in co-culture with the CM-MSCs showed a reduction of the cancer tumorigenicity. In addition, the invasion and aggressiveness of cancer cell lines was significantly decreased by CM-MSC; this was translated by a decrease in MMP-2, MMP-9, and CA-125 mRNA expression, and an increase in TIMP 1, 2, and 3 mRNA expression. An increase in IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines, and a decrease in GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-9, were also noted.In conclusion, mesenchymal stem cells derived from different sources and their conditioned media appear to have a major role in inhibition of cancer aggressiveness and might be considered as a potential therapeutic tool in ovarian cancer.

Maternal obesity (MO) predisposes offspring to metabolic disorders, but the mechanisms remain poorly defined. Recent studies emphasize the importance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in maintaining metabolic health, and MO was recently demonstrated to impair BAT thermogenic function in offspring. The current study aimed to investigate the mechanisms leading to the impairment in fetal BAT development due to MO. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet or a 60% high-fat diet for 10<U+202F>weeks, mated and maintained on their respective diets during pregnancy. Fetal tissue was collected at E18.5, the late stage of pregnancy. Fetal BAT contained more triglycerides compared to the control, which was correlated with higher expression of white adipogenic markers. On the other hand, the expression of BAT markers was down-regulated in the MO fetal BAT. Based on RNA-sequencing analyses, genes related to mitochondriogenesis and myogenesis were found to be down-regulated, while those related to white adipocyte differentiation were up-regulated in MO fetal BAT. Because brown adipocytes are derived from myogenic progenitors, the down-regulation of myogenic genes might partially explain hampered brown adipogenesis in MO fetal BAT. Consistently, mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial biogenesis markers were also down-regulated in MO fetal BAT. MicroRNA-sequencing identified that miR-204-5p expression was elevated in MO fetal BAT. This microRNA targeted the 3'-untranslated regions of PGC1a and Sirt1 mRNA to suppress their expression and impair mitochondriogenesis. In summary, MO impaired fetal BAT development through suppressing myogenesis and brown adipogenesis while enhancing white adipogenic commitment, and inhibited mitochondriogenesis partially through enhancing miR-204-5p expression.

PURPOSE: Fatty acid composition in blood and adipose tissue (AT) is a useful biomarker of dietary fat quality. However, circulating saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have been proposed to also reflect carbohydrate-induced de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity. We aimed to test the hypothesis that high carbohydrate intake is related to SFA and MUFA in serum or AT in a Swedish population.METHODS: Fatty acid composition was measured in serum phospholipids (PL) and AT by gas chromatography in 63-year-old men (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>299). Carbohydrate and alcohol intake was assessed (validated 7-day food records) in relation to total SFA, 16:0 (palmitate), 16:1 (palmitoleate), and estimated SCD activity (16:1n-7/16:0-ratio) in serum PL and in AT, respectively.RESULTS: Total carbohydrate intake was inversely associated with 16:0 in PL (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005), independently of BMI. Disaccharides were non-linearly (restricted cubic splines) and weakly associated with 16:1 and SCD activity in PL (nonlinear trend, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02) but not AT. Carbohydrate intake and SCD expression were not associated (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.08, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>81). Alcohol intake was, however, linearly associated with 16:0 in PL (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), and with 16:1 (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and SCD activity (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005) in both PL and AT.CONCLUSIONS: Higher carbohydrate intake from sugar-rich foods or beverages was not clearly reflected by higher SFA or SCD activity in serum PL or AT. Alcohol was, however, associated with higher SFA and MUFA.

Most fatty acids (FAs) making up the adipose tissue in mammals have a dietary origin and suffer little modification when they are stored. However, we propose that some of those FAs, specifically those that can be synthesised or modified by mammals, are also being influenced by thermal forces and used as part of the mechanism to regulate core body temperature. As FA desaturation increases, adipose tissues can reach colder temperatures without solidifying. The ability to cool the superficial fat tissues helps create a thermal gradient, which contributes to body heat loss reduction. Therefore, it is expected that animals exposed to colder environments will possess adipose tissues with higher proportions of desaturated FAs. Here, through a model selection approach that accounts for phylogeny, we investigate how the variation in FA desaturation in 54 mammalian species relates to the thermal proxies: latitude, physical environment (terrestrial, semi-aquatic and fully-aquatic) and hair density.</AbstractText>: Most fatty acids (FAs) making up the adipose tissue in mammals have a dietary origin and suffer little modification when they are stored.

Aquatic mammals had higher FA desaturation compared to terrestrial mammals. Semi-aquatic mammals had significantly higher levels of desaturated FAs when living in higher latitudes whereas terrestrial and fully-aquatic mammals did not. To account for dietary influence, a double bond index was calculated including all FAs, and revealed no correlation with latitude in any of the groups.</AbstractText>: The interaction between the environment (terrestrial, semi- or fully-aquatic) and the latitude in which the animals lived explained best the variation of FA desaturation in mammals.

Potentially this is because, like terrestrial mammals, they experience the greatest air temperature variations across latitudes, but they lack a thick fur coat and rely primarily on their blubber. Unlike fully-aquatic mammals, extremely thick blubber is not ideal for semi-aquatic mammals, as this is detrimental to their manoeuvrability on land. Therefore, the adipose tissue in semi-aquatic mammals plays a more important role in keeping warm, and the modification of FAs becomes crucial to withstand cold temperatures and maintain a pliable blubber.</AbstractText>: We propose that FA modification is an important component of the thermoregulatory strategy, particularly in semi-aquatic mammals.

Aging is a risk factor for adipose tissue dysfunction, which is associated with inflammatory innate immune mechanisms. Since the adipose tissue/liver axis contributes to hepatosteatosis, we sought to determine age-related adipose tissue dysfunction in the context of the activation of the innate immune system fostering fatty liver phenotypes. Using wildtype and immune-deficient mice, we compared visceral adipose tissue and liver mass as well as hepatic lipid storage in young (ca. 14 weeks) and adult (ca. 30 weeks) mice. Adipocyte size was determined as an indicator of adipocyte function and liver steatosis was quantified by hepatic lipid content. Further, lipid storage was investigated under normal and steatosis-inducing culture conditions in isolated hepatocytes. The physiological age-related increase in body weight was associated with a disproportionate increase in adipose tissue mass in immune-deficient mice, which coincided with higher triglyceride storage in the liver. Lipid storage was similar in isolated hepatocytes from wildtype and immune-deficient mice under normal culture conditions but was significantly higher in immune-deficient than in wildtype hepatocytes under steatosis-inducing culture conditions. Immune-deficient mice also displayed increased inflammatory, adipogenic, and lipogenic markers in serum and adipose tissue. Thus, the age-related increase in body weight coincided with an increase in adipose tissue mass and hepatic steatosis. In association with a (pro-)inflammatory milieu, aging thus promotes hepatosteatosis, especially in immune-deficient mice.

Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the carboxylic form of vitamin A, lowers body weight in rodents by promoting oxidative metabolism in multiple tissues including white and brown adipose tissues. We aimed to identify novel markers of the metabolic impact of ATRA through targeted blood metabolomics analyses, with a focus on acylcarnitines and amino acids. Blood was obtained from mice treated with a high ATRA dose (50 mg/kg body weight/day, subcutaneous injection) or placebo (controls) during the 4 days preceding collection. LC-MS/MS analyses with a focus on acylcarnitines and amino acids were conducted on plasma and PBMC. Main results showed that, relative to controls, ATRA-treated mice had in plasma: increased levels of carnitine, acetylcarnitine, and longer acylcarnitine species; decreased levels of citrulline, and increased global arginine bioavailability ratio for nitric oxide synthesis; increased levels of creatine, taurine and docosahexaenoic acid; and a decreased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio. While some of these features likely reflect the stimulation of lipid mobilization and oxidation promoted by ATRA treatment systemically, other may also play a causal role underlying ATRA actions. The results connect ATRA to specific nutrition-modulated biochemical pathways, and suggest novel mechanisms of action of vitamin A-derived retinoic acid on metabolic health.

Bone tissue engineering as an alternative strategy, provides a great opportunity for regeneration of large bone tissue lesions. The use of biodegradable porous scaffolds along with stem cells, cytokines and growth factors improves cell survival, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, clay nanoplates (CNPs) were surface-modified (MCNPs) using phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide, then porous polyurethane (PU) scaffolds and PU-MCNPs nanocomposite scaffolds were synthesized using solvent evaporation-dissolution technique. Physicochemical and morphological properties of scaffolds and MCNPs were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, thermal behavior of scaffolds was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Degradability, water uptake and mechanical behaviors of scaffolds were evaluated and hydrophilicity properties of them were obtained by contact angle technique. MTT assay and Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide (AO/EB) staining were used to assess the biocompatibility of MCNPs and PU scaffolds regarding cell attachment and proliferation support. Osteogenic differentiation of cultured human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) on MCNPs, PU and PU-MCNPs scaffolds was evaluated using common osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium content assay, Alizarin Red staining, immunocytochemical analysis (ICC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). According to the results, the surface modification of CNPs and their presence into the PU scaffolds significantly enhanced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs. These results were obtained by higher ALP enzyme activity, biomineralization and expression of osteogenic related proteins and genes in differentiated hADSCs on PU-MCNPs scaffolds. In conclusion, our results revealed that these biocompatible nanocomposites porous scaffolds with proper cell adhesion and proliferation as well as effective osteogenic differentiation and which are able to provide a new and useful matrix for bone tissue engineering purposes.

Hydrogel fibers are structurally and biologically useful devices for differentiation of stem cells and fabrication of filament-like tissues. We established cell-laden degradable hydrogel fibers through visible light-initiated crosslinking to differentiate stem cells and fabricate filament-like tissue. Human adipose stem cell (hADSC)-laden fibers were fabricated by cross-linking phenolic-substituted alginate and gelatin (Alg-Ph and Gela-Ph respectively) in an aqueous solution containing cells. The crosslinking of phenolic moieties was mediated by ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl dication (Ru(II) bpy and sodium ammonium persulfate (SPS) and irradiating visible light. The hydrogel microfiber fabricated with desirable geometries and dimensions. The encapsulated hADSCs proliferated and grew within hydrogel microfiber, maintained their multipotency ability and formed filament-like constructs. The filament-like tissues covered with an additional heterogeneous cell layer was made by degrading the fiber membrane using alginate-lyase after covering the fiber surface with vascular endothelial cells. Cellular viability is preserved during Alg-Ph and Gela-Ph hydrogel fiber fabrication and filament-like tissue formation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of Alg-based hydrogel fibers obtained through the Ru/SPS-mediated crosslinking system and visible light irradiation for the engineering of filament-like tissues and cell-based therapeutic treatments.

Bioactive glasses have potential applications in the field of regenerative medicine due to their bioactivity that permits interaction with both hard and soft tissues. In the same way, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been experimentally tested as part of engineered constructs considering their self-renewal and multipotent capacities. However, to design an association, it is crucial to investigate the physical properties of bioglass 45S5, as well as its biocompatibility. Therefore, we investigated the structural short range order of the stoichiometric 45S5, by obtaining its total structure factors (S(K)) and total pair distribution function G(r). The in vitro compatibility of human MSCs with 45S5 was verified by viability, morphometry and osteoinduction assays, F-actin staining and scanning electron (SEM) analysis. The compatibility outcome was verified through a subcutaneous implantation in a murine model by grafting the 45S5 as a scaffold for allogeneic MSCs. The cell-substrate modulation includes the maintenance of the MSC viability and osteoinduction potential after being exposed to the 45S5 extract. A low spreading during cell adhesion was detected. Both normal actin cytoskeleton organization and nuclei irregularities were observed, besides an increase of hydroxyapatite (HA) depositions around cells. Cells showed satisfactory compatibility patterns when growing over 45S5 for 7, 30 and 90<U+202F>days. The implant did not show any apparent toxicity for organs, or strong immunogenic reactions, and it was accompanied by a dense capsule formation around the graft. Our results indicate that MSCs can grow in the long term on the 45S5 while maintaining their characteristics. This fact, together with a non-toxicity to animals means that the 45S5 can be implemented in pre-clinical trials aiming MSC's transplantation leading to further bone and tissue repair.

BACKGROUND: The authors present a case of multinodular goiter in an HIV-positive patient affected by lipodystrophy with particular accumulation of adipose tissue in the region of the neck and trunk.CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 53-year-old man, presented with multinodular struma with partial retrosternal engagement, as well as multiple thyroid nodules increasing in size; some of the nodules had suspicious characteristics on ultrasound. Needle aspiration biopsy was difficult to use to determine the presence of lipodystrophy; however, even in the absence of cytology, surgical treatment was necessary due to the presence of dyspnea during exercise, the dimension of the goiter with retrosternal engagement, and the ovalization of the tracheal lumen. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy by anterior cervicotomy with particular attention to patient positioning because of the buffalo hump and taurine neck. Histological examination was positive for adenomatous hyperplasia with outbreaks of papillary microcarcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this case report was to highlight the importance of the perioperative teamwork, with particular attention to patient positioning before surgery, as well as professional collaboration and experience among the operators.

BACKGROUND: Maternal metabolic syndrome during gestation and lactation leads to several Se-status-related metabolic changes in offspring. MS leads to hepatomegaly, liver oxidation, resistance to insulin challenges and selenoptroteins expression upregulation, producing an energy imbalance in hepatocytes. As Se is necessary for correct heart function, Se deposits are depleted and selenoproteins expression downregulated in heart; this depletion being related to cardiovascular damage. Recently, selenoproteins have been directly implicated in the central endocrine regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis.METHODS: To obtain information about how Se is involved in regulating endocrine peripheral energy balance during MS process, two experimental groups of dam rats were used: control (Se: 0.1<U+202F>ppm) and MS (Fructose 65% and Se: 0.1<U+202F>ppm). At the end of lactation (21d old), the pups' appetite profile, tissular Se deposits and peptides from gastrointestinal tract (including pancreas), leptin, skeletal growth markers and cytokines in serum were measured.RESULTS: MS-exposed pups present changes in Se homeostasis, appetite profile and endocrine energy balance signals related to impaired insulin secretion and high leptin serum values. This profoundly affects the pups' growth profile since muscle and bones are in catabolic process and brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass decreases.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the pups are suffering a process similar to diabetes type 1 which appeared when dams received low Se dietary supply and they point to Se as an important marker and key treatment for these disorders during gestation and lactation that affect future adult health.

AIMS: Fibrosis as the hallmark of adipose tissue dysfunction which is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, results from deposition of excess extra cellular matrix components like collagen and increased cell death. Here we investigated the effect of antidiabetic drug, Metformin, on the factors that play role in fibrosis such as; integrin/ERK pathway, collagen VI, MMP2, MMP9, apoptosis markers including DAPK1, DAPK3, DAP, SIVA, necrosis markers including RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL in insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes.METHODS: 3T3-L1 adipocytes after differentiation to insulin resistant and hypertrophied cells, treated with Metformin, and the gene expression of aforementioned factors assayed by real time PCR. The protein expression of collagen VI and ERK assayed by western blotting.KEY FINDINGS: The expression of integrins changed from 0.5 to 6-fold in hypertrophied adipocyte versus adipocyte. Apoptosis and necrosis markers increased &gt;1.5-fold in insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes. Also ECM components and ERK activation increased &gt;2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively in insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes. Metformin caused reduction of activity of integrin/ERK pathway in Metformin treated insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes compared to untreated group. Metformin also reduced collagen VI in both gene and protein expression level, MMP2 and MMP9 in gene expression, and also the expression of apoptosis and necrosis gene.SIGNIFICANCE: Metformin with reduction of ECM component as collagen VI, MMP2 and MMP9, integrin/ERK pathway, necrosis markers as RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL, and apoptosis markers including DAP, DAPK1, DAPK3 and SIVA effects on fibrosis in insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes in vitro.

Despite advances in microsurgical techniques, treatment options to restore prior function following peripheral nerve injury remain unavailable, and autologous nerve grafting remains the therapy of choice. Recent experimental work has focused on the development of artificial constructs incorporating smart biomaterials and stem cells, aspiring to match/improve the outcomes of nerve autografting. Chemically stimulated human adipose-derived stem cells (dhASC) can improve nerve regeneration outcomes; however, these properties are lost when chemical stimulation is withdrawn, and survival rate upon transplantation is low. It is hypothesized that interactions with synthetic hydrogel matrices could maintain and improve neurotrophic characteristics of dhASC. dhASC are cultured on PeptiGel-Alpha 1 and PeptiGel-Alpha 2 self-assembling peptide hydrogels, showing comparable viability to collagen I control gels. Culturing dhASC on Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 substrates allow the maintenance of neurotrophic features, such as the expression of growth factors and neuroglial markers. Both Alpha 1 and Alpha 2 substrates are suitable for the culture of peripheral sensory neurons, permitting sprouting of neuronal extensions without the need of biological extracellular matrices, and preserving neuronal function. PeptiGel substrates loaded with hdASC are proposed as promising candidates for the development of tissue engineering therapies for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries.

External volume expansion (EVE) is an effective method of adipose tissue regeneration. However, it remains unclear how EVE induces adipose tissue regeneration. Here, we developed EVE devices to generate expanded prefabricated adipose tissue (EPAT) in rats and investigated cell proliferation, adipogenesis and the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins during the 12 weeks suction. In addition, EPAT-generated decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) was used to assess the role of ECM proteins in cell proliferation and differentiation. Matrix deposition was significantly increased after EVE suction, with fibronectin and laminin showing the most dramatic changes. Fibronectin expression peaked during weeks 1-4, when Ki67 cells in EPAT peaked. Laminin expression peaked during weeks 8-12, when peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) expression also peaked. In vitro, adipose stem cells (ASCs) displayed a higher proliferation rate in week 1 DAT, when fibronectin expression was highest, whereas ASC adipogenesis was significantly higher on week 12 DAT, when laminin expression was abundant. These results showed that EVE device enhanced ECM deposition which is closely related to cell proliferation and differentiation.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between wrist circumference, markers of adipose dysfunction, and cardiovascular risk in youths with obesity.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we measured body mass composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, wrist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, fasting blood insulin, glucose, lipid profile, adiponectin, and leptin in 280 children with overweight/obesity and without diabetes (age: 7-18 years). Cardiovascular risk was estimated by &quot;metabolic syndrome score&quot; (MetS score).CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that wrist circumference independently relates to adiponectin-leptin ratio and to the prediction of cardiovascular risk, suggesting it as an efficient and adjunctive anthropometric marker of cardiometabolic risk in children with obesity.

INTRODUCTION: miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, some of which are expressed in adipose tissues, are present in the circulation, and are regulated in obesity. Bariatric surgery (BS) has been proposed to lead to activation of brown adipose tissue, an effect that may be related to beneficial effects of BS on systemic metabolism. Here, we evaluated circulating levels of miR-92a and miR-99b, two miRNAs proposed as biomarkers of brown fat activity, in a cohort of patients with severe obesity before and after BS, and studied their potential relationship with BS-associated improvements in metabolic parameters.RESULTS: Basal levels of miR-92a were significantly increased in patients with obesity relative to lean controls. Serum miR-92a levels were strongly reduced at 6 months after BS, reaching levels similar to those in controls. Serum miR-99b levels were unchanged in relation to both the obese condition and BS. Elevated levels of miR-92a were directly correlated with worsened glucose homeostasis parameters and poor BS outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that miR-92a is elevated in conditions of obesity, and its reduction after BS correlates with metabolic improvement. Further studies would be necessary to establish miR-92a as serum biomarker and potential predictor of the BS success in improving the metabolic status of patients with obesity.

Flavonoids are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites and are the most common group of polyphenolic compounds in the human diet. In recent studies, flavonoids have been shown to induce browning of white adipocytes, increase energy consumption, inhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and improve metabolic status. Promoting the activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducing white adipose tissue (WAT) browning are promising means to increase energy expenditure and improve glucose and lipid metabolism. This review summarizes recent advances in the knowledge of flavonoid compounds and their metabolites.</AbstractText>: Flavonoids are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites and are the most common group of polyphenolic compounds in the human diet.

Flavonoids activated the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), promoted the release of adrenaline and thyroid hormones to increase thermogenesis and induced WAT browning through the AMPK-PGC-1a/Sirt1 and PPAR signalling pathways. Flavonoids may also promote brown preadipocyte differentiation, inhibit apoptosis and produce inflammatory factors in BAT.</AbstractText>: We summarized the effects of flavonoids on fat metabolism and the specific underlying mechanisms in sub-categories.

Trehalose is well known as a functional disaccharide with anti-metabolic activities such as suppression of adipocyte hypertrophy in mice and alleviation of impaired glucose tolerance in humans. Recently, a new type of adipocyte beige cells, involved in so-called white adipocyte tissue (WAT) browning, has received much attention as a target for adaptive thermogenesis. To clarify the relationship between adipocyte hypertrophy suppression and beige cells involved in thermogenesis, we examined the effect of trehalose on the changes in beige adipocytes in mice under normal dietary conditions.</AbstractText>: Trehalose is well known as a functional disaccharide with anti-metabolic activities such as suppression of adipocyte hypertrophy in mice and alleviation of impaired glucose tolerance in humans.

BACKGROUND: Cluster analyses have proposed different diabetes phenotypes using age, BMI, glycaemia, homoeostasis model estimates, and islet autoantibodies. We tested whether comprehensive phenotyping validates and further characterises these clusters at diagnosis and whether relevant diabetes-related complications differ among these clusters, during 5-years of follow-up.METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the German Diabetes Study underwent comprehensive phenotyping and assessment of laboratory variables. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps, hepatocellular lipid content using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, hepatic fibrosis using non-invasive scores, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathy using functional and clinical criteria. Patients were reassessed after 5 years. The German Diabetes Study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01055093, and is ongoing.FINDINGS: 1105 patients were classified at baseline into five clusters, with 386 (35%) assigned to mild age-related diabetes (MARD), 323 (29%) to mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), 247 (22%) to severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID), 121 (11%) to severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), and 28 (3%) to severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD). At 5-year follow-up, 367 patients were reassessed, 128 (35%) with MARD, 106 (29%) with MOD, 88 (24%) with SAID, 35 (10%) with SIRD, and ten (3%) with SIDD. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was lowest in patients with SIRD at baseline (mean 4·3 mg/kg per min [SD 2·0]) compared with those with SAID (8·4 mg/kg per min [3·2]; p&lt;0·0001), MARD (7·5 mg/kg per min [2·5]; p&lt;0·0001), MOD (6·6 mg/kg per min [2·6]; p=0·0011), and SIDD (5·5 mg/kg per min [2·4]; p=0·0035). The fasting adipose-tissue insulin resistance index at baseline was highest in patients with SIRD (median 15·6 [IQR 9·3-20·9]) and MOD (11·6 [7·4-17·9]) compared with those with MARD (6·0 [3·9-10·3]; both p&lt;0·0001) and SAID (6·0 [3·0-9·5]; both p&lt;0·0001). In patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, hepatocellular lipid content was highest at baseline in patients assigned to the SIRD cluster (median 19% [IQR 11-22]) compared with all other clusters (7% [2-15] for MOD, p=0·00052; 5% [2-11] for MARD, p&lt;0·0001; 2% [0-13] for SIDD, p=0·0083; and 1% [0-3] for SAID, p&lt;0·0001), even after adjustments for baseline medication. Accordingly, hepatic fibrosis at 5-year follow-up was more prevalent in patients with SIRD (n=7 [26%]) than in patients with SAID (n=5 [7%], p=0·0011), MARD (n=12 [12%], p=0·012), MOD (n=13 [15%], p=0·050), and SIDD (n=0 [0%], p value not available). Confirmed diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy was more prevalent at baseline in patients with SIDD (n=9 [36%]) compared with patients with SAID (n=10 [5%], p&lt;0·0001), MARD (n=39 [15%], p=0·00066), MOD (n=26 [11%], p&lt;0·0001), and SIRD (n=10 [17%], p&lt;0·0001).INTERPRETATION: Cluster analysis can characterise cohorts with different degrees of whole-body and adipose-tissue insulin resistance. Specific diabetes clusters show different prevalence of diabetes complications at early stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetic neuropathy. These findings could help improve targeted prevention and treatment and enable precision medicine for diabetes and its comorbidities.FUNDING: German Diabetes Center, German Federal Ministry of Health, Ministry of Culture and Science of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, German Diabetes Association, German Center for Diabetes Research, Research Network SFB 1116 of the German Research Foundation, and Schmutzler Stiftung.

Aging is the result of two overlapping processes, &quot;intrinsic&quot; and &quot;extrinsic.&quot; Intrinsic structural changes occur as a consequence of physiologic aging and are genetically determined; extrinsic relates to exposure to harmful events and habits, like smoking, bad diet, alcohol consumption, lack of sleep, stress, sun exposure, environmental pollution, etc. Aging may be decelerated by improving bad habits or treating signs of aging with various esthetic methods, food supplements, and antioxidants. It is believed that we cannot stop aging entirely due to the intrinsic part, which leads to irreversible cell damage, as well as tissue and organ damage due to their limited ability to regenerate. Stem cells and their ability to exhibit telomerase activity, to self-renew, and to differentiate into all three embryonic tissues challenges aging as a process, which is not inevitable and can even possibly be reversed. Stem cells can promote regeneration of aged tissues and organs by replacing apoptotic and necrotic cells with healthy ones. In addition, they can have antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic properties by paracrine-secreting growth factors and cytokines on the site of administration. Autologous adipose-derived stem cells are the most promising because they can be easily harvested in huge numbers with minimally invasive liposuction and, as such, represent a powerful tool in anti-aging and regenerative medicine. In this contribution, the author discusses their properties and application in clinical practice.

Although stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to facilitate regeneration of injured tissue, there is no report that evaluates the immune-modulating effect of stem cell-derived EVs on Th2-mediated inflammation. In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of adipose stem cells (ASCs)-derived EVs on Th2-mediated inflammation induced by Aspergillus protease antigen in lung epithelial cells. The EVs were isolated from supernatant of ASCs and the diameters of EVs were measured by using dynamic light scattering. The mice primary lung epithelial cells and mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE12) were pre-treated with 200<U+202F>ng/ml of Aspergillus protease and then treated with 1<U+202F>µg/ml of ASC-derived EVs. Real time PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of eotaxin, IL-25, TGF-ß, and IL-10 mRNAs after EV treatment. To evaluate the role of EVs in macrophage polarization and dendritic cells (DCs) differentiation, in vitro bone marrow-derived macrophage and DCs stimulation assay was performed. EV treatment significantly decreased the expression of eotaxin and IL-25 and increased TGF-ß and IL-10 in both lung epithelial cells. EV treatment significantly increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80, and CD 86 in immature DCs. Furthermore, EV treatment significantly enhanced the gene expression of M2 macrophage marker such as Arg1, CCL22, IL-10, and TGF-ß. In conclusion, EVs of ASCs ameliorated Th2-mediated inflammation induced by Aspergillus protease antigen through the activation of dendritic cells and M2 macrophage, accompanied by down-regulation of eotaxin and IL-25, and up-regulation of TGF-ß and IL-10 in mouse lung epithelial cells.

AIMS: Previous work has demonstrated that ketogenic diets promote white fat browning; however, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenom have yet to be elucidated. Recently, an in vitro study showed that supraphysiological concentrations of ß-hydroxybutyrate (ßHB) had a strong influence on the induction of adipocyte browning. On the other hand, concentrations in the physiological range, achieved through ketogenic diets and prolonged fasting produce values of 1-3<U+202F>mM and 4-7<U+202F>mM, respectively. Herein, we investigated the impact of physiological concentrations of ßHB on metabolism, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and other browning markers in adipose tissues.MAIN METHODS: The effects of ßHB on adipocyte browning were investigated in vitro, using primary cultures of isolated visceral and subcutaneous fat cells and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in vivo.KEY FINDINGS: It was determined that ßHB failed to induce changes in the oxidative capacity, citrate synthase activity or browning gene expression patterns in isolated adipocytes, and did not exert a permissive effect on ß-adrenergic agonist-induced browning. In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated following ßHB treatment exhibited downregulated Ucp1 expression levels, a result that was recapitulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Wistar rats after ßHB salt treatment. Rats administered ßHB salts also presented reduced brown adipose tissue UCP1 protein expression.SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanisms underlying ketogenic diet-induced browning of adipocytes are not known. The results from the present study indicate that physiological concentrations of ßHB are not responsible for this phenomenon, despite the observed ßHB-mediated downregulation of UCP1 expression.

SCOPE: Obesity is a principal causative factor of metabolic syndrome. Niacin potently regulates lipid metabolism. Replacement of saturated fatty acids by MUFAs or inclusion of omega-3 long-chain PUFAs in the diet improves plasma lipid levels. However, the potential benefits of niacin in combination with MUFAs or omega-3 long-chain PUFAs against white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction in the high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome are unknown.CONCLUSION: Niacin in combination with dietary MUFAs can favor WAT homeostasis in the development of HFD-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.

SCOPE: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which affects up to 20% of pregnant women, is associated with maternal peripheral insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress. The flavonoid naringenin has potent anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties; however, its effects in GDM remain unknown. The study aimed to determine the effects of naringenin on glucose metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress associated with GDM both in vitro and in vivo.METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro, human tissue samples obtained at term elective Caesarean section are stimulated with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) to develop a GDM-like environment. Naringenin treatment significantly improves TNF-impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. In placenta and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), naringenin significantly reduces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increases antioxidant mRNA expression. Mechanistically, naringenin suppresses nuclear factor <U+03BA>B activation. In vivo, pregnant heterozygous db/+ mice are used to model GDM. Daily intraperitoneal injections of GDM mice with naringenin from gestational day 10-17 significantly improve glucose tolerance, reduces IL1A mRNA expression, and increases antioxidant mRNA expression in placenta, VAT, and subcutaneous adipose tissue.CONCLUSION: Naringenin is shown to improve insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and oxidative stress associated with GDM and shows promise as a novel preventive therapeutic.

Evidence from randomised controlled trials supports beneficial effects of total dairy products on body weight, fat and lean mass, but evidence on associations of dairy types with distributions of body fat and lean mass is limited. We aimed to investigate associations of total and different types of dairy products with markers of adiposity, and body fat and lean mass distribution. We evaluated cross-sectional data from 12,065 adults aged 30 to 65 years recruited to the Fenland study between 2005 and 2015 in Cambridgeshire UK. Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. We estimated regression coefficients (or % differences) and their 95% CI using multiple linear regression models. The median (interquartile range) of milk, yoghurt, and cheese consumption were 293 (146 - 439), 35.3 (8.8 - 71.8), and 14.6 (4.8 - 26.9) g/d, respectively. Low-fat dairy consumption was inversely associated with visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio estimated with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [-2.58% (-3.91, -1.23%) per serving/day]. Habitual consumption per serving/day (200 g) of milk was associated with 0.33 (0.19, 0.46) kg higher lean mass. Other associations were not significant after false discovery correction. Our findings suggest that the influence of milk consumption on lean mass and of low-fat dairy consumption on fat mass distribution may be potential pathways for the link between dairy consumption and metabolic risk. Our cross-sectional findings warrant further research in prospective and experimental studies in diverse populations.

Both feeding behavior and thermogenesis are regulated by leptin. The sensitivity to leptin's anorexigenic effects on chow diet was previously shown to predict the development of diet-induced obesity. In this study, we determined whether the sensitivity to leptin's anorexigenic effects correlates with leptin's thermogenic response, and if this response is exerted at the level of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), a brain area that plays an important role in thermoregulation. Based on the feeding response to injected leptin on a chow diet, rats were divided into leptin-sensitive (LS) and leptin-resistant (LR) groups. The effects of leptin on core body, brown adipose tissue (BAT) and tail temperature were compared after intravenous versus intra-DMH leptin administration. After intravenous leptin injection, LS rats increased their BAT thermogenesis and reduced heat loss via the tail, resulting in a modest increase in core body temperature. The induction of these thermoregulatory mechanisms with intra-DMH leptin was smaller, but in the same direction as with intravenous leptin administration. In contrast, LR rats did not show any thermogenic response to either intravenous or intra-DMH leptin. These differences in the thermogenic response to leptin were associated with a 1°C lower BAT temperature and reduced UCP1 expression in LR rats under ad libitum feeding. The preexisting sensitivity to the anorexigenic effects of leptin, a predictor for obesity, correlates with the sensitivity to the thermoregulatory effects of leptin, which appears to be exerted, at least in part, at the level of the DMH.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate total, regional, and throwing versus non-throwing arm body composition measures across the 4 major positions of NCAA Division I female softball players using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (n=128). Total and regional total mass (TM), fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and visceral adipose tissue were measured. Athletes were separated into: pitchers (n=32), catchers (n=13), outfielders (n=39), and infielders (n=44). ANOVA and Tukey's HSD assessed total and regional differences between positions. Although no significant total or regional LM differences were observed across positions, outfielders had significantly (p=0.006-0.047) lower total-body, arm, and trunk TM and FM, leg FM, and leg BMC in comparison to pitchers. The throwing arm had significantly (p&lt;0.0001-0.018) greater LM, BMD, and BMC than the non-throwing arm for all positions. Notably, there were minimal body composition differences among softball positions, with the primary differences being that pitchers had larger total and regional fat values than outfielders. The throwing arm of all positions had greater LM, BMD, and BMC than the non-throwing arm. These values can be used by coaches and trainers as descriptive DXA data for collegiate softball players.

BACKGROUND: Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging represents an emerging technology that facilitates the assessment of tissue vascularity, tissue distinction, and tumor localization during surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of ICG imaging during laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy.RESULTS: We investigated six adrenal glands from three patients undergoing bilateral partial adrenalectomy. The indication for surgery was pheochromocytoma in two patients and Cushing's syndrome with bilateral adenomas in one patient. Regarding left adrenalectomies, ICG imaging was helpful in visualizing the adrenal borders and the adrenal vein. Further, it facilitated the identification of the hypofluorescent pheochromocytoma and to resect the entire tumor. On the right side, due to the more apparent anatomy, ICG imaging did not contribute to the conduct of the operation. Four adrenal remnants showed a strong vascularization and two remnants were only reasonably vascularized.CONCLUSION: ICG fluorescence may be helpful in guiding partial adrenalectomy and assessing the vascularity of remaining adrenal tissue.

Due to the increasing clinical application of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC), e.g. lipotransfer for breast reconstruction, this study aimed to gain novel insights regarding ADSC influence on breast tissue remodeling and determine patient-dependent factors affecting lipotransfer as well as begin to address its oncological risks. The ADSC secretome was analyzed from five normal breast reduction patients and contained elevated levels of growth factors, cytokines and proteins mediating invasion. ADSC/ADSC secretomes were tested for their influence on the function of primary mammary epithelial cells, and tumor epithelial cells using cell culture assays. ADSC/ADSC secretomes significantly stimulated proliferation, transmigration and 3D-invasion of primary normal and tumor epithelial cells. IL-6 significantly induced an EMT and invasion. The ADSC secretome significantly upregulated normal epithelial cell gene expression including MMPs and ECM receptors.

D-47 is a newly developed solid dispersion of the arginine salt of (S)-(+)-4-[1-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-oxo-pyrrolidin-4-yl]methoxybenzoic acid (S-2E), which inhibits sterol and fatty acid synthesis. D-47 was recently shown to lower the serum level and hepatic content of both triglyceride and cholesterol in a rabbit model of familial hypercholesterolemia. We here investigated the effects of D-47 on dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in comparison with those of bezafibrate in the db/db mouse model of obesity. Treatment of db/db mice with D-47 or bezafibrate for 14 days lowered the serum triglyceride concentration without affecting that of cholesterol. D-47, but not bezafibrate, almost completely eliminated lipid droplets in hepatocytes and markedly lowered the triglyceride content of the liver in these mice. The two agents induced similar changes in the hepatic expression of genes including those related to ß-oxidation or fatty acid synthesis. D-47 however significantly reduced the mass of white adipose tissue and up-regulated the expression of genes related to energy expenditure, mitochondrial function, fatty acid oxidation or lipolysis in this tissue, indicating that D-47 induced the brown/beige adipocyte-like change in white adipose tissue, whereas bezafibrate had no such effects. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with D-47 provoked the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function, fatty acid oxidation or lipolysis. Our data have thus shown that D-47 ameliorated hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis in an animal model of obesity, and they suggest that this latter effect might be mediated through the change of adipose tissue characteristics.

Viperin is an interferon (IFN)-inducible multifunctional protein. Recent evidence from high-throughput analyses indicates that most IFN-inducible proteins, including viperin, are intrinsically expressed in specific tissues; however, the respective intrinsic functions are unknown. Here we show that the intrinsic expression of viperin regulates adipose tissue thermogenesis, which is known to counter metabolic disease and contribute to the febrile response to pathogen invasion. Viperin knockout mice exhibit increased heat production, resulting in a reduction of fat mass, improvement of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced glucose tolerance, and enhancement of cold tolerance. These thermogenic phenotypes are attributed to an adipocyte-autonomous mechanism that regulates fatty acid ß-oxidation. Under an HFD, viperin expression is increased, and its function is enhanced. Our findings reveal the intrinsic function of viperin as a novel mechanism regulating thermogenesis in adipose tissues, suggesting that viperin represents a molecular target for thermoregulation in clinical contexts.

Recent studies have discovered a selective autophagy-lipophagy, which can selectively identify and degrade lipids and plays an important role in regulating cellular lipid metabolism and maintaining intracellular lipid homeostasis. The process of lipophagy can be directly or indirectly regulated by genes, enzymes, transcriptional regulators and other factors. This review examines the role of lipophagy in reducing liver lipid content, regulating pancreatic lipid metabolism, and regulating adipose tissue differentiation, and summarizes the findings of the molecules (Rab GTPase, enzymes, ion channels, transcription factors, small molecular substances) involved in the regulation of lipophagy, which points to new directions for the treatment of diseases caused by lipid accumulation.

CVD affect about one-third of the population and are the leading cause of mortality. The prevalence of CVD is closely linked to the prevalence of obesity because obesity is commonly associated with metabolic abnormalities that are important risk factors for CVD, including insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and type-2 diabetes, atherosclerotic dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Women have a more beneficial traditional CVD risk profile (lower fasting plasma glucose, less atherogenic lipid profile) and a lower absolute risk for CVD than men. However, the relative risk for CVD associated with hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia is several-fold higher in women than in men. The reasons for the sex differences in CVD risk associated with metabolic abnormalities are unclear but could be related to differences in the mechanisms that cause hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia in men and women, which could influence the pathogenic processes involved in CVD. In the present paper, we review the influence of a person's sex on key aspects of metabolism involved in the cardiometabolic disease process, including insulin action on endogenous glucose production, tissue glucose disposal, and adipose tissue lipolysis, insulin secretion and insulin plasma clearance, postprandial glucose, fatty acid, and triglyceride kinetics, hepatic lipid metabolism and myocardial substrate use. We conclude that there are marked differences in many aspects of metabolism in men and women that are not all attributable to differences in the sex hormone milieu. The mechanisms responsible for these differences and the clinical implications of these observations are unclear and require further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a vital role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, most studies ascribed the function of PVAT in vascular remodeling to adipokines secreted by the perivascular adipocytes. Whether mesenchymal stem cells exist in PVAT and play a role in vascular regeneration remain unknown. Approach and Results: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allowed direct visualization of the heterogeneous PVAT-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PV-ADSCs) at a high resolution and revealed 2 distinct subpopulations, among which one featured signaling pathways crucial for smooth muscle differentiation. Pseudotime analysis of cultured PV-ADSCs unraveled their smooth muscle differentiation trajectory. Transplantation of cultured PV-ADSCs in mouse vein graft model suggested the contribution of PV-ADSCs to vascular remodeling through smooth muscle differentiation. Mechanistically, treatment with TGF-ß1 (transforming growth factor ß1) and transfection of microRNA (miR)-378a-3p mimics induced a similar metabolic reprogramming of PV-ADSCs, including upregulated mitochondrial potential and altered lipid levels, such as increased cholesterol and promoted smooth muscle differentiation.CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allows direct visualization of PV-ADSC heterogeneity at a single-cell level and uncovers 2 subpopulations with distinct signature genes and signaling pathways. The function of PVAT in vascular regeneration is partly attributed to PV-ADSCs and their differentiation towards smooth muscle lineage. Mechanistic study presents miR-378a-3p which is a potent regulator of metabolic reprogramming as a potential therapeutic target for vascular regeneration.

Selenium, an essential trace element known mainly for its antioxidant properties, is critical for proper brain function and regulation of energy metabolism. Whole-body knockout of the selenium recycling enzyme, selenocysteine lyase (Scly), increases susceptibility to metabolic syndrome and diet-induced obesity in mice. Scly knockout mice also have decreased selenoprotein expression levels in the hypothalamus, a key regulator of energy homeostasis. This study investigated the role of selenium in whole-body metabolism regulation using a mouse model with hypothalamic knockout of Scly. Agouti-related peptide (Agrp) promoter-driven Scly knockout resulted in reduced weight gain and adiposity while on a high-fat diet (HFD). Scly-Agrp knockout mice had reduced Agrp expression in the hypothalamus, as measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC also revealed that while control mice developed HFD-induced leptin resistance in the arcuate nucleus, Scly-Agrp knockout mice maintained leptin sensitivity. Brown adipose tissue from Scly-Agrp knockout mice had reduced lipid deposition and increased expression of the thermogenic marker uncoupled protein-1. This study sheds light on the important role of selenium utilization in energy homeostasis, provides new information on the interplay between the central nervous system and whole-body metabolism, and may help identify key targets of interest for therapeutic treatment of metabolic disorders.

Melatonin (MLT) plays a role in preserving bone health, a function that may depend on homeostatic effects on both mature osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of the bone tissue. In this study, these functions of MLT have been investigated in rat bone (femur) and in human adipose MSC (hMSC) during chronic exposure to low-grade cadmium (Cd) toxicity, a serious public health concern. The in vivo findings demonstrate that MLT protects against Cd-induced bone metabolism disruption and accumulation of bone marrow adipocytes, a cue of impaired osteogenic potential of skeletal MSC niches. This latter symptom was recapitulated in hMSCs in which Cd toxicity stimulated adipogenic differentiation and MLT was found to rescue, at least in part, the osteogenic differentiation properties of these cells. This study reports on a new bone cytoprotection function of MLT pertinent to Cd toxicology and its interfering effect on skeletal MSC differentiation properties that is worth investigating for its possible impact on human bone pathophysiology.

OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of hydrocortisone administration on serum leptin and adiponectin concentrations, abdominal fat distribution, and mRNA expression of leptin and adiponectin in abdominal adipose tissue of dogs.ANIMALS: 12 healthy dogs.PROCEDURES: Dogs received hydrocortisone (8.5 mg/kg; n = 6) or a placebo (6) orally every 12 hours for 90 days. Serum leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured with a canine-specific ELISA on the day before (day 0; baseline) and during (days 1, 3, 7, 30, 60, and 90) administration. On days 0, 30, 60, and 90, abdominal fat mass was quantified with CT, and mRNA expression of leptin and adiponectin in abdominal fat was analyzed by use of a PCR assay.RESULTS: Hydrocortisone administration resulted in an increase in visceral fat mass on days 60 and 90, compared with the mass at baseline. Visceral fat mass at the level of L3 increased during hydrocortisone administration. Serum leptin concentration began to increase on day 1 and was significantly higher than the baseline concentration on days 30 and 60. Serum adiponectin concentration on days 30, 60, and 90 was significantly lower than the baseline concentration. Leptin and adiponectin mRNA expression in abdominal fat was greater on day 30, compared with expression at baseline, but lower on days 60 and 90, compared with expression on day 30. Serum leptin concentration and visceral fat mass were correlated.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Hydrocortisone administration affected abdominal fat distribution and serum leptin and adiponectin concentrations through dysregulation of leptin and adiponectin expression.

The following case studies describe the use of the Smith Medical implanted ports and Gripper huber needles. Smiths Medical produces a range of implanted ports that include the Port-A-Cath and P.A.S. Port Power P.A.C. systems. The ports are easy to implant, maintain and remove. They are lightweight and have features that are designed to reduce complication rates, including a highly compressed septum to increase needle retention, a titanium chamber with a gouge-resistant floor, a bevelled chamber for optimal rinsing, a round shape to avoid overturning and the Ultralock connection. They are available in various configurations, with single and dual lumens. There is also a needle for power-injection of contrast media for certain types of diagnostic imaging scans (Smith Medical 18). The Gripper Plus needle is designed with an emphasis on safety, effectiveness and patient comfort. These non-coring needles have a bevelled tip that sits flush with the back of the port without impeding the flow of fluid; this also prevents holes forming in the septum (Barton et al, 2018). The needle is available in different gauges and lengths, which can be tailored to reflect individual patient needs and the amount of adipose tissue present. It is essential to select the correct size, which will reduce the risk of dislodgement. The Gripper needles are compatible with paclitaxel and lipid solutions, and are recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (1999). They are compatible with both the Port-a-Cath and P.A.S. Port Power P.A.C. systems, and can be ordered from the same manufacturer, which has the potential to make ordering, training and support more efficient.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Skeletal muscle is the predominant site for glucose disposal and fatty acid consumption. Emerging evidence indicates the crosstalk between adipose and skeletal muscle is critical in maintaining insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis. The current study was designed to investigate whether myricanol (MY) improves insulin sensitivity and alleviates adiposity through modulating skeletal muscle-adipose crosstalk.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The therapeutic effect of MY was evaluated on palmitic acid (PA)-treated C2C12 myotubes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The crosstalk between myotubes and adipocytes was evaluated using Transwell assay. The cellular lipid content was examined by Nile Red staining. The mitochondrial content was assessed by Mitotracker Green staining and citrate synthase activity; and the mitochondrial function was examined by Seahorse assay. The expression of mitochondria-related and insulin signaling pathway proteins was analyzed by Western blots, and the irisin level was determined by ELISA kit.KEY RESULTS: MY was found to increase mitochondrial quantity and function through activating AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, MY stimulated irisin production and secretion from myotubes to reduce lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In HFD-fed mice, MY treatment alleviated adiposity and insulin resistance through enhancing lipid utilization and irisin production in skeletal muscle, and inducing browning of inguinal fat.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, MY modulates skeletal muscle-adipose crosstalk, to stimulate browning of adipose tissue and improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. MY might be a potential candidate for treating insulin resistance and obesity.

Obesity is increasingly prevalent and is associated with substantial cardiovascular risk. Adipose tissue distribution and morphology play a key role in determining the degree of adverse effects, and a key factor in the disease process appears to be the inflammatory cell population in adipose tissue. Healthy adipose tissue secretes a number of vasoactive adipokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and changes to this secretory profile will contribute to pathogenesis in obesity. In this review, we discuss the links between adipokine dysregulation and the development of hypertension and diabetes and explore the potential for manipulating adipose tissue morphology and its immune cell population to improve cardiovascular health in obesity.

Cardiovascular diseases represent the leading cause of death and moderate physical exercise is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between the amount of exercise recorded daily by a wearable gravitometer for 3 months and selected biochemical and clinical parameters. Nineteen sedentary type 2 diabetics were recruited and distributed into three homogenous groups, low, medium, and high exercise, according to the level of physical exercise monitored and expressed as MOVEs. Data showed an inverse correlation between MOVEs and oxidative stress indexes and a significant improvement in paraoxonase-1 activities and endothelial functionality. Decrease of visceral/total adipose tissue ratio, systolic blood pressure and a down-regulation of the inflammatory microRNA-146a in high exercise group were observed. Finally, a decrease of glycosylated hemoglobin and an up-regulation of the angiogenic microRNA-130a in medium exercise one was obtained. In this study, precise daily monitoring permitted to underline the importance of the amount of physical activity to counteract some cardiovascular risk factors persisting in diabetes. Finally, it identifies new microRNA biomarkers for future investigation on the same topic.

By differentiating into and the balance being regulated between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) heterogeneous populations, macrophages play critical roles during the host immune response in various physiological contexts in both health and diseases. Besides regulating innate and adaptive immune capacity, macrophages are also decisively involved in tissue homeostasis. However, how resident macrophages are regulated after tissue damages is still far from elucidation. In the present study, we found that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) apparently promote bone defect rehabilitation in vivo via skewing differentiation of bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDMs) towards anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. In vitro data demonstrated that although ADSCs have the potential to differentiate to osteoblasts and adipose cells by using standard tissue culture-differentiating conditions, these mesenchymal progenitors are mainly regulated to differentiate into osteoblasts with overexpressed runt-related transcription factor 2, osteoprotegerin, osterix, and downregulated receptor activator of nuclear factor <U+03BA>B ligand in the presence of BMDMs-conditioned medium. Whereas BMDMs are polarized toward M2 macrophages with higher levels of arginase 1 and mannose receptor, but lower levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-a when cocultured with ADSCs. In short, all these findings collectively demonstrated that ADSCs and resident host cells can synergistically contribute to the bony repair through mutual regulation of their differentiation and cytokine secretion.

RESULTS: The LCS diet increased subcutaneous abdominal fat by  20% without causing weight gain, and reduced insulin clearance by  40%, while whole-body glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity were unchanged. In contrast, glucose uptake in the duodenum, liver and brain increased by 57, 66 and 29% relative to the control diet group (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05 for all), while insulin sensitivity increased by 53, 55 and 28% (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05 for all), respectively. In the brain, glucose uptake increased significantly only in the frontal cortex, associated with improved metabolic connectivity towards the hippocampus and the amygdala.CONCLUSIONS: In miniature pigs, the combination of sucralose and acesulfame K is biologically active. While not affecting whole-body insulin resistance, it increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in specific tissues, mimicking the effects of obesity in the adipose tissue and in the brain.

Polyurethane foam (PU foam) is a new material which is being used in producing both macro-anatomical and micro-anatomical specimens. PU foam is simple to use, without need for special equipment. The present study was carried out to evaluate morphology of coronary sinus and its tributaries. During the study, we encountered few problems in carrying out injections. Coronary sinus and its tributaries were difficult to cannulate since the coronary sinus lacks a vascular stem, around which ligature can be tied before injection so that the cannula can be held in place. In contrast, in majority of the organs it is easy to inject since they possess tubular vascular stem to hold the cannula in place. A new device was developed which could be used to cannulate coronary sinus orifice to inject the casting media. The second problem we faced was saponification of adipose tissue. This made corrosion of the soft tissue difficult. Hence in this study, we describe the device we have developed to place in the coronary sinus orifice, and how saponified adipose tissue was taken care during the actual maceration step.

BACKGROUND: Polarized macrophage populations can orchestrate both inflammation of the kidney and tissue repair during CKD. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages initiate kidney injury, but mechanisms through which persistent M1-dependent kidney damage culminates in fibrosis require elucidation. Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc-finger transcription factor that suppresses inflammatory signals, is an essential regulator of macrophage polarization in adipose tissues, but the effect of myeloid KLF4 on CKD progression is unknown.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that macrophage KLF4 ameliorates CKD by mitigating TNF-dependent injury and fibrosis.

Mammographic density (MD) is a strong breast cancer risk factor that reflects fibroglandular and adipose tissue composition, but its biologic underpinnings are poorly understood. Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are markers that may be associated with MD given their hypothesized role in breast carcinogenesis. IGFBPs sequester IGF-I, limiting its bioavailability. Prior studies have found positive associations between circulating IGF-I and the IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio and breast cancer risk. We evaluated the associations of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and six other IGFBPs with MD.</AbstractText>: Mammographic density (MD) is a strong breast cancer risk factor that reflects fibroglandular and adipose tissue composition, but its biologic underpinnings are poorly understood.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disorder and an important risk factor for the onset of several chronic syndromes. Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in the development of obesity, promoting the infiltration and accumulation of leukocytes in the tissue and sustaining adipocyte expansion. Anthocyanins exert a broad range of health benefits, but their effect in improving obesity-related inflammation in vivo has been poorly characterized. We examined the effects of a purple corn cob extract in the context of AT inflammation in a murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.RESULTS: RED extract intake resulted in lower MCP-1 mediated recruitment and proliferation of macrophages into crown-like structures in the AT. AT macrophages (ATM) of HF<U+2009>+<U+2009>RED group upregulated M2 markers (ArgI, Fizz1, TGFß), downregulating inflammatory mediators (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1ß, COX-2) thanks to the suppression of NF-kB signalling. ATM also increased the expression of iron metabolism-related genes (FABP4, Hmox1, Ferroportin, CD163, TfR1, Ceruloplasmin, FtL1, FtH1) associated with a reduction in iron storage and increased turnover. ATM from HF<U+2009>+<U+2009>RED mice did not respond to LPS treatment ex vivo, confirming the long-lasting effects of the treatment on M2 polarization. Adipocytes of HF<U+2009>+<U+2009>RED group improved lipid metabolism and displayed a lower inflammation grade. Liver histology revealed a remarkable reduction of steatosis in the HF<U+2009>+<U+2009>RED group, and Kupffer cell profiling displayed a marked switch towards the M2 phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: RED extract attenuated AT inflammation in vivo, with a long-lasting reprogramming of ATM and adipocyte profiles towards the anti-inflammatory phenotype, therefore representing a valuable supplement in the context of obesity-associated disorders.

BMP-2 is widely used in spinal fusion but can cause adverse effects like the formation of ectopic bone and adipose tissue in vivo. Nel-like molecule-1 (NELL-1) has been shown to suppress BMP-2-induced adverse effects. However, no optimum carriers that control both NELL-1 and BMP-2 releases to elicit long-term bioactivity have been developed. In the present study, we employed polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) as a control release carrier for dual delivery of NELL-1 and BMP-2. An ultra-low dose of BMP-2 synergistically functioned with NELL-1 on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) osteogenic differentiation with greater mineralization in vitro. The osteoinductive ability of NELL-1 and an ultra-low dose of BMP-2 in PEC was investigated in rat posterolateral spinal fusion. Our results showed increased fusion rate, bone architectures and improved bone stiffness at eight weeks after surgery in the combination groups compared to NELL-1 or BMP-2 alone. Moreover, the formation of ectopic bone and adipose tissue was negligible in all the PEC groups. In summary, dual delivery of NELL-1 and an ultra-low dose of BMP-2 in the PEC control release carrier has greater fusion efficiency compared to BMP-2 alone and could potentially be a better alternative to the currently used BMP-2 treatments for spinal fusion.

Injury to parathyroid glands during thyroid and parathyroid surgery is common and postoperative hypoparathyroidism represents a serious complication. Parathyroid glands possess a unique autofluorescence in the near-infrared spectrum which could be used for their identification and protection at an early stage of the operation. In the present study parathyroid autofluorescence was visualized intraoperatively using a standard Storz laparoscopic near-infrared/indocyanine green (NIR/ICG) imaging system with minor modifications to the xenon light source (filtered to emit 690 nm to 790 nm light, less than 1% in the red and green above 470 nm and no blue light). During exposure to NIR light parathyroid tissue was expected to show autofluorescence at 820 nm, captured in the blue channel of the camera. Over a period of 5 years, we investigated 205 parathyroid glands from 117 patients. 179 (87.3%) glands were correctly identified by their autofluorescence. Surrounding structures such as thyroid, lymph nodes, muscle, or adipose tissue did not reveal substantial autofluorescence. We conclude that parathyroid glands can be identified by their unique autofluorescence at an early stage of the operation. This may help to preserve these fragile structures and their vascularization and lower the rate of postoperative hypocalcemia.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is a conserved mechanism to maintain body temperature in mammals. However, since BAT contribution to energy expenditure can represent a relevant modulator of metabolic homeostasis, many studies have focused on the nervous system and endocrine factors that control the activity of this tissue. There is long-established evidence that the counter-regulatory hormone glucagon negatively influences energy balance, enhances satiety, and increases energy expenditure. Despite compelling evidence showing that glucagon has direct action on BAT thermogenesis, recent findings are questioning this conventional attribute of glucagon action. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin secreted by the intestinal tract which strongly decreases feeding, and, furthermore, improves metabolic parameters associated with obesity and diabetes. Therefore, GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1-R) have emerged as a promising target in the treatment of metabolic disorders. In this short review, we will summarize the latest evidence in this regard, as well as the current therapeutic glucagon- and GLP-1-based approaches to treating obesity.

ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is an integral cell-membrane protein that mediates the rate-limiting step of high density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis and suppression of inflammation by triggering a number of signaling pathways via interacting with an apolipoprotein acceptor. The hepatic ABCA1 is involved in regulation of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) production by affecting the apolipoprotein B trafficking and lipidation of VLDL particles. This protein is involved in protecting the function of pancreatic ß-cells and insulin secretion by cholesterol homeostasis. Adipose tissue lipolysis is associated with ABCA1 activity. This transporter is involved in controlling obesity and insulin sensitivity by regulating triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and influencing on adiponectin, visfatin, leptin, and GLUT4 genes expression. The ABCA1 of skeletal muscle cells play a role in increasing the glucose uptake by enhancing the Akt phosphorylation and transferring GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Abnormal status of ABCA1-regulated phenotypes is observed in metabolic syndrome. This syndrome is associated with the occurrence of many diseases. This review is a summary of the role of ABCA1 in HDL and VLDL production, homeostasis of insulin and glucose, suppression of inflammation and obesity controlling to provide a better insight into the association of this protein with metabolic syndrome.

AIMS: Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is suggested as a surrogate marker for visceral adipose tissue dysfunction. It is an empirical-mathematical model, sex-specific, based on metabolic and anthropometric parameters. Diabetes mellitus is growing in an expanding fashion globally. The aim of this study to study the association between VAI and glycemic control in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 300 T2DM female aged (25-60 years) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited from Baghdad medical city during the period from January 2017 to July 2018. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure was measured and fasting blood sample was analyzed for blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin(HbA1c), and lipid profile. VAI was calculated in addition to triglyceride-glucose (TyG) derived indices. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS version 23. The study was ethically approved.RESULTS: Patients with high VAI showed poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, elevated TYG index, TYGWC and TYGBMI. The number of diabetics with poor glycemic control increased across the VAI quartiles. The area under the curve in ROC analysis demonstrated that VAI had a good predictive ability to identify the state of glycemic control as compared to other anthropometric measures (WC, BMI) or combined metabolic and anthropometric measures (TyGWC, TyGBMI).CONCLUSION: increased VAI adversely affects the glycemic control in women with T2DM.

BACKGROUND: Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is a formula to estimate visceral fat accumulation which has been reported to have a better prediction for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Caucasian population. This systematic review is proposed to inquire whether VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with different body composition compared to the Caucasian.METHODS: All studies performed in Asia and published in English on VAI prediction on the incidence of T2DM were included. The search keywords used in Pubmed and Cochrane database were visceral adiposity index, VAI and T2DM.RESULTS: Seven included studies, of which six studies were conducted in China and one in Iran. Four studies were prospective cohorts and the other three were cross-sectional. The largest study population were 7639 subjects, while the longest observation period was 15 years. This study found that VAI can be used as a predictor of T2DM in Asian population with better prediction values compared to Caucasian population. The reported odds ratio or hazard ratio ranged from 1.2 to 3.6.CONCLUSIONS: VAI is a practical formula used to estimate the accumulation of visceral fat which can be used as a predictor for T2DM in Asian population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with metabolic dysfunction and over nutrition. Increased body mass index and obesity are strongly amalgamated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to altered secretion of adipocytokines, inflammatory mediators release as well as chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. The purposes of this study were to review the evidence of how obesity and inflammation may lead to insulin resistance and cancer.SUMMARY: Recent findings suggested that increased level of inflammatory mediators in obesity, plays an introductory and cabalistic role in the development of different types of inflammatory disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Link between elevated body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several of the factors-such as increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, decreased levels of adiponectin, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation etc. consequently result in carcinogenesis and carcinogenic progression too.CONCLUSION: This review summarizes how cytokine production in adipose tissue of obese subject creates a chronic inflammatory environment that favors tumor cell motility and invasion to enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells. High levels of cytokine in the circulation of affected individuals have been associated with a significantly worse outcome. This article also reconnoiters the mechanisms that link obesity to numerous disorders such as inflammation, diabetes, cancers and most specifically combine these processes in a single image. Understanding these mechanisms may assist to understand the consequences of obesity.

Secreted frizzled-related protein (sFRP) 4 is an adipokine with increased expression in white adipose tissue from obese subjects with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Yet, it is unknown whether sFRP4 action contributes to the development of these pathologies. Here, we determined whether sFRP4 expression in visceral fat associates with NAFLD and whether it directly interferes with insulin action and lipid and glucose metabolism in primary hepatocytes and myotubes. The association of sFRP4 with clinical measures was investigated in obese men with or without type 2 diabetes and with or without biopsy-proven NAFLD. To determine the impact of sFRP4 on metabolic parameters, primary human myotubes (hSkMC), or primary hepatocytes from metabolic healthy C57Bl6 and from systemic insulin-resistant mice, i.e. aP2-SREBP-1c, were used. Gene expression of sFRP4 in visceral fat from obese men associated with insulin sensitivity, triglycerides and NAFLD. In C57Bl6 hepatocytes, sFRP4 disturbed insulin action. Specifically, sFRP4 decreased the abundance of IRS1 and FoxO1 together with impaired insulin-mediated activation of Akt-signalling and glycogen synthesis and a reduced suppression of gluconeogenesis by insulin. Moreover, sFRP4 enhanced insulin-stimulated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL). In hSkMC, sFRP4 induced glycolysis rather than inhibiting insulin signalling. Finally, in hepatocytes from aP2-SREBP-1c mice, sFRP4 potentiates existing insulin resistance. Collectively, we show that sFRP4 interferes with hepatocyte insulin action. Physiologically, sFRP4 promotes DNL in hepatocytes and glycolysis in myotubes. These sFRP4-mediated responses may result in a vicious cycle, in which enhanced rates of DNL and glycolysis aggravate hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance.

AIMS: Obesity is not only associated with metabolic diseases but is also a symptom of menopause in women. To date, there are no effective drugs for the management of obesity, and it is important to find new agents with fewer side effects, for the treatment of obesity. This study aimed to determine the anti-obesity effect of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, and its underlying mechanism in rats with ovariectomy-induced obesity.KEY FINDINGS: Compared with sham rats, Ovx rats showed increased weight gain, food intake, WAT mass, TG levels, adipogenic protein expression, and decreased locomotor activity. Furthermore, autophagy-related proteins and Foxo3a of WAT were significantly increased in Ovx rats. However, with the exclusion of increased food intake, the changes induced by Ovx were all reversed in 17-DMAG-treated Ovx rats. In addition, the expression of Hsp70 and phosphorylation of Akt increased in 17-DMAG-treated Ovx rats.SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that 17-DMAG significantly ameliorated obesity induced by Ovx, and this phenomenon is accompanied by the downregulation of adipogenic-related and autophagy-related proteins as well as Akt-phosphorylation and Hsp70 expression. Therefore, 17-DMAG may be a potential agent for preventing or treating obesity in postmenopausal women.

RATIONALE: Primary hepatic myelolipoma is a rare benign neoplasm comprising mature adipose tissue and marrow components in various proportions. Chemical shift imaging (CSI) can distinguish the lipid within the tumor clearly; however, there have been no reports on the CSI of hepatic myelolipoma.PATIENT CONCERN: A 20-year-old woman visited our hospital after discovering a space-occupying lesion in the liver with a history of more than 1 year. She felt distension pain and discomfort under the xiphoid process, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and occasional chest oppression.DIAGNOSIS: The tumor showed a well-defined mass with a pseudocapsule and a heterogeneous appearance on both T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. CSI analysis showed a signal decline within the tumor. Based on the histopathology, the tumor was diagnosed as hepatic myelolipoma.INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The patient underwent a right hepatectomy, and the postoperative vital signs were stable. Two weeks later, the patient was discharged safely.LESSONS: Although hepatic myelolipoma is extremely rare, this condition should be considered in differential diagnosis when CSI shows that hepatic lesions contain fatty.

INTRODUCTION: Transplantation of the keratinocytes, fibroblasts, bone marrow, and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells may improve chronic wound healing by delivery of different cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which play an essential role in wound healing. The purposes of this review were to check which cell lines are potentially beneficial in enhancement of wound healing and to describe the safety and efficacy of cell therapies in the clinical treatment of chronic wounds, as well as to summarize the pertinent literature and research progress in this field.METHODS: PubMed search engine and ClinicalTrials.gov were used to analyze the available data on cell therapies applied in treatment of chronic wound. The analysis included 51 articles, assessing the use of keratinocytes (10), fibroblasts (7), keratinocytes and fibroblasts (10), bone marrow-derived cells (20), and adipose tissue cells (4). Studies on the cell-based products that are currently available on the market (Dermagraft, EpiDex, Apligraf, and HP802-247) were also included, with majority of reports found on fibroblasts and keratinocytes studies.RESULTS: Cell-based therapies have a great potential to improve wound healing without major surgical procedures and donor-site morbidity. There is, however, a lack of guidelines on how the age of the patients, the general health conditions, and the coexistence of different diseases may affect the success of these therapies. Further studies are needed to determine the fate of transplanted cells and the number of cells required to obtain optimal effects and outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Despite many promising clinical trials on application of various stem cell-based therapies for treatment of chronic wounds, there is still a need for multicenter comparative studies assessing the dose response and the cell source response on the efficacy of chronic wound healing.

RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease (RALD) is a recently described noninfectious and nonmalignant clinical syndrome characterized by autoimmune disorders, massive splenomegaly, modest lymphadenopathy, and monocytosis. On the molecular level, RALD is defined by somatic mutations of either NRAS or KRAS gene in a subset of hematopoietic cells. To date, there is a dearth of well-documented histopathologic description of cutaneous involvement by RALD in the literature. In the current case report, a 43-year-old female patient with a history of RALD presented with clinical pictures of sepsis and an erythematous rash in the left lower extremity. Histologic examination revealed a dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of immature myeloid cells admixed with scattered neutrophils involving the dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue, imparting a panniculitis-like histologic pictures. There was a strong angiocentric propensity of the immature hematopoietic cells as well as extensive extravasation of red blood cells, even in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemically, the immature hematopoietic cells were positive for CD43, CD4, and CD68, but negative for CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase. Overall, the histologic and cytologic findings were highly reminiscent of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. Review of the English literature revealed cutaneous involvements by RALD only in patients with KRAS mutation compared with none of its NRAS counterparts. However, larger clinicopathologic studies on cutaneous involvement by RALD are warranted. The term &quot;RALD cutis&quot; with its histologic and molecular features is suggested to serve as a potential groundwork for future studies of this rare phenomenon.

Cytokines, chemokines, C-reactive proteins (CRP) and ferritin are known inflammatory markers. However, cytokines such as interleukin (IL-1ß), (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a) have been reported to interfere with both the bone resorption and bone formation processes. Similarly, immune cell cytokines are known to contribute to inflammation of the adipose tissue especially with obesity. IL-10 but not IL-33 has been linked to lower ferritin levels and anemia. In this study, we hypothesized that specific cytokine levels in the plasma of women with low bone mineral density (BMD) would be higher than those in the plasma of healthy women due to the actions of elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inducing osteoclast formation and differentiation during senescence.</AbstractText>: Cytokines, chemokines, C-reactive proteins (CRP) and ferritin are known inflammatory markers.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested a potential association between low vitamin D serum levels and several pathological conditions apart from the well-known bone disorders. Thus, vitamin D insufficiency has been linked to cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.OBJECTIVE: This review intends to provide an overview of recent evidence from clinical studies on vitamin D [25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)] and cardio-metabolic risk factors in overweight adults. Furthermore, we also discussed potential mechanisms and limits of the retrieved results.METHOD: The search process was based on the selection of publications (RCT) listed in PubMed and Cochrane Library databases Results: Vitamin D status evidenced an inversely strong association with subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adiposity, but not significantly related with other body weight measures (i.e., body mass index). Studies have shown a potential inverse association of hypovitaminosis D with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors.CONCLUSION: The mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency enhances adiposity, as well as putative association with metabolic syndrome features remain still unclear. Further investigation would be required to conclude whether vitamin D has an independent role in the prevention of cardiometabolic disorders.

The function of connective tissues depends on the physical and biochemical properties of their extracellular matrix (ECM), which are in turn dictated by ECM protein composition. With the primary objective of obtaining quantitative estimates for absolute and relative amounts of ECM proteins, we performed a systematic review of papers reporting protein composition of human connective tissues. Articles were included in meta-analysis if they contained absolute or relative quantification of proteins found in the ECM of human bone, adipose tissue, tendon, ligament, cartilage and skeletal muscle. We generated absolute quantitative estimates for collagen in articular cartilage, intervertebral disk (IVD), skeletal muscle, tendon, and adipose tissue. In addition, sulfated glycosaminoglycans were quantified in articular cartilage, tendon and skeletal muscle; total proteoglycans in IVD and articular cartilage, fibronectin in tendon, ligament and articular cartilage, and elastin in tendon and IVD cartilage. We identified significant increases in collagen content in the annulus fibrosus of degenerating IVD and osteoarthritic articular cartilage, and in elastin content in degenerating disc. In contrast, collagen content was decreased in the scoliotic IVD. Finally, we built quantitative whole-tissue component breakdowns. Quantitative estimates improve our understanding of composition of human connective tissues, providing insights into their function in physiology and pathology.

BACKGROUND: Macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity has been identified as a predictor for cardiovascular disease. We assessed the relationship between adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle microRNAs and macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity.RESULTS: Efflux capacity was significantly associated with HDL (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.30, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01) and LDL (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.33, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005) particle size. Multivariate-analysis identified six microRNAs associated (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) with cholesterol efflux capacity: miR-3129-5p (Beta<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.695), miR-20b (0.430), miR9-5p (0.111), miR-320d (-<U+2009>0.190), miR301a-5p (0.042), miR-155-5p (0.004). In response to increasing concentrations (1 µg/mL vs. 3 µg/mL) of VAT extracellular vesicle, cholesterol efflux (66%<U+2009>±<U+2009>10% vs. 49%<U+2009>±<U+2009>2%; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and expression of ABCA1 (FC<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.8 vs 0.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.2; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), CD36 (0.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.4 vs. 2.1<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.8, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02), CYP27A1 (1.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.4 vs. 0.9<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.5; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), and LXRA (1.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.1 vs. 0.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.2; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) was altered in THP-1 cells in vitro.CONCLUSION: Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle microRNAs may, in part, be involved macrophage cholesterol efflux regulation.

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may play a critical role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of human VAT-released pro-inflammatory cytokines on monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. The cytokine effects on monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cells (ECs) were tested using adipose tissue-conditioned media (ATCM) prepared by culturing human VAT. The cytokines concentrations in ATCM, the cytokines expression and adhesion molecules in stimulated ECs were measured. The concentrations of IL-1ß,TNF-a,MCP-1,IL-10,and RANTES measured in ATCM correlated positively with monocyte adhesiveness to ECs. Additionally, ATCM increased the adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) gene expression. Selective inhibitors highlighted the importance of IL-1ß and TNF-a in the process by a significant decrease in monocyte adhesion compared to ATCM preconditioning without inhibitors. Human VAT significantly increased monocyte adhesion to ECs. It was significantly influenced by IL-1ß, TNF-a, MCP-1, IL-10, and RANTES, with IL-1ß and TNF-a having the strongest impact.

INTRODUCTION: Madelungs disease is a rare illness manifested by the uncontrollable proliferation of unencapsulated adipose tissue which accumulates symmetrically in the hypodermis in the area of the neck, shoulders, back and thighs. As part of differential diagnosis it is necessary to investigate tumours in the area of the neck, dysfunction of the thyroid gland, Cushings syndrome and rare lipomatosis.CASE REPORT: In the case report, the authors present the case of a 52-year-old male patient with a large formation on the neck, trunk and the scrotal area. A suspicion of liposarcoma was expressed based on the imaging examinations performed.RESULTS: Excisions of tumorous loci on several occasions were indicated for the patient. Lipomas without abnormalities were proven in all histolo-gical examinations.CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of Madelungs disease is based on the clinical findings, imaging (computed tomography CT, magnetic resonance imaging MRI) and biopsy examination. Laboratory methods tend to focus rather on associated internal diseases. Treatment is only symptomatic and consists in surgical removal of the foci. However, it is often associated with the risk of recurrence.

Arterial hypertension is strongly related to overweight and obesity. In obese subjects, several mechanisms may lead to hypertension such as insulin and leptin resistance, perivascular adipose tissue dysfunction, renal impairment, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system activation and sympathetic nervous system activity. Weight loss (WL) seems to have positive effects on blood pressure (BP). The aim of this review was to explain the mechanisms linking obesity and hypertension and to evaluate the main studies assessing the effect of WL on BP. We analysed studies published in the last 10 years (13 studies either interventional or observational) showing the effect of WL on BP. Different WL strategies were taken into account-diet and lifestyle modification, pharmacological intervention and bariatric surgery. Although a positive effect of WL could be identified in each study, the main difference seems to be the magnitude and the durability of BP reduction over time. Nevertheless, further follow-up data are needed: there is still a lack of evidence about long term effects of WL on hypertension. Hence, given the significant results obtained in several recent studies, weight management should always be pursued in obese patients with hypertension.

CONTEXT: Microscopic measurement of adipocyte size is the gold standard for determining adipose tissue (AT) quality. AT density on computed tomography (CT) may also reflect adipocyte quality (lower density=poorer quality).OBJECTIVE: We used abdominal subcutaneous AT (SAT) specimens and CT scans to validate CT SAT density as a marker of SAT quality in adults living with HIV.SETTING AND DESIGN: Secondary data analysis from completed trial of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation (ACTG A5224s). CT abdominal SAT density was measured in Hounsfield Units (HU). SAT specimens were digitally scanned for calculation of mean adipocyte area.PARTICIPANTS: Included participants had SAT biopsy and CT data at baseline (n=54), and HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL on ART and biopsy or CT data at week 96 (n=30).INTERVENTION: None.OUTCOME MEASURES: Spearman's correlations and linear regression models adjusting for participant characteristics examined associations between SAT density and adipocyte area.RESULTS: Baseline median age was 40 years, CD4+ T lymphocyte count 219 cells/mm3 and BMI 26.0 kg/m2; 89% were male and 67% Caucasian. Median SAT area and density were 199 cm2 and -100 HU. Over 96 weeks, SAT area increased (+18%) and SAT density decreased (-3%). Mean SAT adipocyte area correlated with SAT density (p&lt;0.01) off and on ART after adjusting for SAT area, age, race, sex, CD4+ T lymphocyte count and HIV-1 RNA.CONCLUSIONS: CT SAT density correlates with biopsy-quantified SAT adipocyte size in adults with HIV on and off ART, suggesting that CT is a useful tool for non-invasive assessment of SAT quality.

Cutaneous spindle cell adenolipoma (SCAL) is a recently described rare variant of lipoma with 11 cases reported to date. Here we report a consultation case of a 77-year-old male who presented with a nodule on the right nasolabial fold, diagnosed as apocrine fibroadenoma or sebaceous hyperplasia by an outside pathologist. The specimen revealed an ill-defined dermal tumor composed of mature adipocytes, bland spindle cells, ropey collagen, and dilated eccrine and apocrine glands and ducts in a fibromyxoid stroma. The spindle cells were positive for CD34 and negative for S100 protein and SOX10. These findings are consistent with those of cutaneous SCAL. The pathogenesis of this entity is controversial and includes a hamartomatous process, derivation from adipose tissue surrounding eccrine glands, or preexisting glands entrapment within a growing lipoma. In the present case, the glandular component is extensive and includes both eccrine and apocrine differentiation, which has not been previously described and further supports the hamartomatous nature. Awareness of this rare entity is helpful to prevent confusion with other look-alike primary and metastatic cutaneous lesions.

OBJECTIVE: Abdominal obesity and wall thickness of the central arteries have been associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Despite the higher burden of overweight and cardiovascular disease among African Americans, limited data are available on the association of abdominal obesity with aortic wall thickness in African Americans. We assessed the cross-sectional and the longitudinal associations of abdominal obesity with aortic intima-media thickness (aIMT) in a cohort of African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study.METHODS: Data on aIMT and repeated measures of waist circumference (WC) and waist to height ratio from 1,572 participants, as well as on abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and aIMT from 1,223 participants, were analyzed. aIMT was measured at proximal ascending aorta (PA-aIMT), proximal descending aorta (PD-aIMT), and distal aorta (bifurcation) using cardiac magnetic resonance. SAT and VAT were measured using computerized tomography.RESULTS: WC and WHtR were longitudinally associated with PA-aIMT and PD-aIMT; SAT and VAT were associated with PA-aIMT only. Only WC was associated with distal aIMT.CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal obesity measures are associated with increased proximal aIMT in adult African Americans. Only WC is associated with wall thickness in all three segments of the aorta.

OBJECTIVE: Prepregnancy obesity is an epidemic disorder that seriously threatens both maternal and offspring health. This study investigated the effects of ß3-adrenergic receptor (ß3-AR) activation on the perinatal outcomes in a diet-induced prepregnancy obese (PPO) murine model.METHODS: Four-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were fed high-fat diet or chow diet for 16 weeks to yield PPO mice and chow-fed (CF) lean mice, respectively. After successful mating with CF males, the PPO and CF mice were both randomly divided into vehicle control- or CL316,243 (a highly selective ß3-AR agonist)-treated groups. On gestational day 7, subcutaneous infusion of CL316,243 or saline vehicle (1 mg/kg/d) was provided using osmotic pumps. The perinatal outcomes, adipose tissue morphology, and metabolic and inflammatory markers were examined.RESULTS: Chronic ß3-AR agonist infusion induced brown adipose tissue activation and white adipose tissue browning and countered obesity-induced alterations in lipid profiles, insulin resistance, and systemic and local inflammatory states. Moreover, ß3-AR activation was associated with improved placental perfusion and offspring outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that pharmacological ß3-AR activation may be of therapeutic potential in preventing prepregnancy-obesity-associated adverse maternal and offspring perinatal outcomes.

This study aimed to determine whether autologous orthobiologic tissue source affects pain and functional outcomes in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) who received microfragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) or bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection. We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data from patients who received BMAC or MFAT injection for symptomatic knee OA. Patients completed baseline and follow-up surveys. Each survey included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire, Emory Quality of Life (EQOL) questionnaire, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. The follow-up responses were compared with baseline for all patients and between BMAC and MFAT groups. A total of 110 patients met inclusion criteria, with 76 patients (BMAC 41, MFAT 35) and 106 knees (BMAC 58, MFAT 48) having appropriate follow-up data. The BMAC group included 17 females and 24 males, with a mean age of 59<U+2009>±<U+2009>11. The MFAT group included 23 females and 12 males, with a mean age of 63<U+2009>±<U+2009>11. Minimum follow-up time was 0.5 years. Mean follow-up time was 1.80<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.88 years for BMAC and 1.09<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.49 years for MFAT. Both groups had significant improvement in EQOL, VAS, and all KOOS parameters preprocedure versus postprocedure (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.001). There was not a significant difference when comparing postprocedure scores between groups (p = .09, .38, .63, .94, .17, .15, .70, respectively). These data demonstrate significant improvement in pain and function with both MFAT and BMAC injections in patients with symptomatic knee OA without a significant difference in improvement when comparing the two autologous tissue sources.

Elucidation of the pig microRNAome is essential for interpreting functional elements of the genome and understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits. Here, we extracted small RNAs from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and we compared their expression levels between one Western breed (Yorkshire) and seven indigenous Chinese breeds. We detected the expression of 172 known porcine microRNAs (miRNAs) and 181 novel miRNAs. Differential expression analysis found 92 and 12 differentially expressed miRNAs in adipose and muscle tissue respectively. We found that different Chinese breeds shared common directional miRNA expression changes compared to Yorkshire pigs. Some miRNAs differentially expressed across multiple Chinese breeds, including ssc-miR-129-5p, ssc-miR-30 and ssc-miR-150, are involved in adipose tissue function. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs are associated mainly with signaling pathways rather than metabolic and biosynthetic processes. The miRNA-target gene and miRNA-phenotypic traits networks identified many hub miRNAs that regulate a large number of target genes or phenotypic traits. Specifically, we found that intramuscular fat content is regulated by the greatest number of miRNAs in muscle tissue. This study provides valuable new candidate miRNAs that will aid in the improvement of meat quality and production.

OBJECTIVE: Brown and beige adipocytes in humans and rodents are specialized to burn lipids for heat generation as a natural defense against cold and obesity, which is advantageous to metabolic homeostasis. MicroRNAs as another regulatory layer to regulate metabolic homeostasis attracted a lot of attentions. Our previous work revealed microRNA (miR)-203 as a brown adipocyte-enriched microRNA involved in brown adipocytes development. However, the potential role of miR-203 in adipose tissue metabolic homeostasis has not been determined in vivo. In this study, we investigate the potential role of miR-203 in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sub-WAT) browning and metabolic homeostasis.METHODS: We investigated the relationship between miR-203 and energy homeostasis in adipose tissue from cold exposed, high fat diet (HFD) fed, ob/ob and db/db mice. The functions of miR-203 on sub-WAT browning were validated through miR-203 knockdown or overexpression. The miR-203 targeted signal pathway was screened by RNAseq analysis. Luciferase report assay, western blot, and qPCR were performed to establish the miR-203 related upstream and downstream signal pathway in vivo and in vitro. The functions of miR-203 on obesity and metabolic homeostasis were validated through GTT/ITT and western blot on high fat diet-induced obesity in C57 mice. ELISA was used to determine the concentration of IFN-<U+03B3>. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissue.RESULTS: MiR-203 expression positively correlates with energy expenditure, and overexpression of miR-203 could enhance sub-WAT browning in normal diet (ND) condition. Mechanistically, the expression of miR-203 is activated by cAMP-dependent C/EBPß up-regulation. Subsequently, miR-203 inhibits IFN-<U+03B3> signal pathway activation by directly targeting Lyn, which is an activator of Jak1-Stat1. Moreover, the forced expression of miR-203 could improve insulin sensitivity and resist high fat diet-induced obesity by inhibiting IFN-<U+03B3>.CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-203 (miR-203) promotes white adipose tissue browning in cold exposed mice and improves glucose tolerance in HFD fed mice by repressing IFN-<U+03B3>. Since miR-203 is activated by cAMP-dependent C/EBPß up-regulation and directly represses IFN-<U+03B3> signal pathway, we declare that miR-203 acts as a messenger between cAMP signal pathway and IFN-<U+03B3> signal pathway.

BACKGROUND: The bone marrow (BM) is a major reservoir of resting memory T cells and long-lived plasma cells, capable of providing protection against recurrent infections. Whether the age-related accumulation of adipose tissue in the BM affects the functionality and maintenance of memory cells is not well understood.METHODS: For the first time, we compare human femur marrow adipose tissue (fMAT) and subcutaneous white adipose tissue of the thigh (tsWAT) obtained from the same donors. Therefore, we used microarrays for comparative global gene expression analysis, and employed assays to analyse parameters of adipocyte biology, inflammation and oxidative stress.FINDINGS: We show that fMAT adipocytes differ significantly from tsWAT adipocytes regarding specific gene expression profiles including inflammatory responses and adipogenesis/adipocyte phenotype. Concomitant with considerably lower levels of CD36, a membrane-associated protein important for long-chain fatty acid uptake that is used as maturation marker, fMAT adipocytes are smaller and contain less triglycerides. fMAT adipocytes secrete similar levels of adiponectin and leptin as tsWAT adipocytes, and express increased levels of pro-inflammatory molecules concomitant with an elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired function of plasma cells in the BM.INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that fMAT is a unique type of adipose tissue containing small adipocytes with lower CD36 protein and triglyceride levels than tsWAT but high adipokine secretion. Moreover, fMAT adipocytes secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to inflammation and impairment of plasma cell function in the BM, suggesting that fMAT has more immune regulatory functions than tsWAT.

BACKGROUND: Organ crosstalk can be defined as the complex and mutual biological communication between distant organs mediated by signaling factors. Normally, crosstalk helps to coordinate and maintain homeostasis, but sudden or chronic dysfunction in any organ causes dysregulation in another organ. Many signal molecules, including cytokines and growth factors, are involved in the metabolic dysregulation, and excessive or inappropriate release of these molecules leads to organ dysfunction or disease (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes).AIM AND METHOD: The aim of this review is to reveal the impact of organ crosstalk on the pathogenesis of diseases associated with organ interactions and the role of inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the organ dysfunction. After searching in MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar databases using 'organ crosstalk' as a keyword, studies related to organ crosstalk and organ interaction were compiled and examined.CONCLUSION: The organ crosstalk and the functional integration of organ systems are exceedingly complex processes. Organ crosstalk contributes to metabolic homeostasis and affects the inflammatory response, related pathways and fibrotic changes. As in the case of interactions between adipose tissue and intestine, stimulation of inflammatory mechanisms plays an active role in the development of diseases including insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hepatic steatosis. The increased level of knowledge about the 'crosstalk' between any organ and distant organs will facilitate the early diagnosis of the disease as well as the management of the treatment practices in the short- and long-term organ dysfunction.

Proper waste utilization in order to promote value added product is a promising scientific practice in recent era. Inspiring from the recurring trend, we propose a single step oxidative pyrolysis derived fluorescent carbon dots (C-dots) from Allium sativum peel, which is a natural, nontoxic, and waste raw material. Because of its excellent optical properties, and photostability this C-dots have been used in versatile area of applications. Due to its immediate water dispersing character, C-dots reinforced Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) films revealed improvement in uniaxial stretching behavior and can be used as transparent sunlight conversion film. The nanocomposite film has been tested against rigorous simulated sunlight which proved almost identical sunlight conversion behavior with no photo-bleachable character which is definitely added an extra quality of transparent polymer films. Moreover, the C-dots dispersion has been used as in vitro biomarker for living cells owing to its ease in solubility, biocompatibility, non-cytotoxicity and bright fluorescence even in subcutaneous environment. For this case, adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) have been chosen and injected to rabbit ear skin to perform two-photon imaging experiment. The present work opens a new avenue towards the large-scale synthesis of bio-waste based fluorescent C-dots, paving the way for their versatile applications.

Although obesity has been proven as a risk factor of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, there have been few studies addressing the association between obesity and cerebral white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume with controversial findings. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between abdominal fat distribution and WMH volume in a neurologically healthy population. We performed an observational study in a consecutive series of subjects who were examined during voluntary health check-ups between January 2006 and December 2013. We directly measured both visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) using abdominal computed tomography. The WMH volumes were also recorded quantitatively. A total of 2504 subjects were included in this study. In multivariate analysis, the relationship between SAT and WMH volume remained significant (ß<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.170, standard error [SE]<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.065, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>.006) after adjusting for confounding factors. The protective effects of SAT on the WMH volume were more prominent in female participants (ß<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.295, SE<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.138, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>.033) and in severely obese participants (ß<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.358, SE<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.167, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>.033). Conclusively, we demonstrated a negative association between SAT and WMH volume in a healthy population.

AIM: This study evaluated whether the consumption of locally produced food without additives might have a positive effect on known risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, and levels of fasting glucose and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Attention was focused on various types of cheese, sausages, fresh pasta, pastries, biscuits and chocolate without additives to make them palatable and durable for transport.METHODS: Healthy volunteers were randomized to purchase the foods under study from either local producers not using additives (group 1) or supermarkets (group 2). At baseline and after 6 months, both groups underwent evaluation for weight, blood pressure, VAT, serum sodium, potassium, fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and creatinine levels, and also the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) by examiners blinded to group allocation. At baseline, the state part of the STAI and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV were also performed, and body mass index, HOMA index and estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated.RESULTS: Data for 159 subjects (89 in group 1, 70 in group 2) were analyzed. Baseline evaluations did not differ between groups. At 6 months, HOMA scores and fasting glucose levels were lower in group 1 than in group 2 (P&lt;0.01). Also, in group 1, VAT (P=0.006), systolic blood pressure (P=0.001) and BDI-II score (P=0.0005) were decreased, whereas serum fasting glucose (P=0.04) and C-peptide (P=0.03) levels, and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.02), were increased in group 2.CONCLUSION: Consumption of the locally produced food under study improved some of the major risk factors for NCDs after 6 months.

Obesity is a risk factor for multiple diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Within obese adipose tissue, multiple factors contribute to creating a disease-promoting environment, including metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis. Recent evidence points to fibrotic responses, particularly extracellular matrix remodeling, in playing a highly functional role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Fibroblast activation protein plays an essential role in remodeling collagen-rich matrices in the context of fibrosis and cancer. We observed that FAP-null mice have increased weight compared to wild-type controls, and so investigated the role of FAP in regulating diet-induced obesity. Using genetically engineered mouse models and in-vitro cell-derived matrices, we demonstrate that FAP expression by pre-adipocytes restrains adipogenic differentiation. We further show that FAP-mediated matrix remodeling alters lipid metabolism in part by regulating mTOR signaling. The impact of FAP on adipogenic differentiation and mTOR signaling together confers resistance to diet-induced obesity. The critical role of ECM remodeling in regulating obesity offers new potential targets for therapy.

NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? This review summarizes and synthesizes what is known about the contribution of inflammation to age-related arterial dysfunction. What advances does it highlight? This review details observational evidence for the relationship of age-related inflammation and arterial dysfunction, insight from autoimmune inflammatory diseases and their effects on arterial function, interventional evidence linking inflammation and age-related arterial dysfunction, insight into age-related arterial inflammation from preclinical models and interventions to ameliorate age-related inflammation and arterial dysfunction.ABSTRACT: Advanced age is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the industrialized world. Two major components of arterial ageing are stiffening of the large arteries and impaired endothelium-dependent dilatation in multiple vascular beds. These two alterations are major contributors to the development of overt cardiovascular disease. Increasing inflammation with advanced age is likely to play a role in this arterial dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about inflammation and its relationship to age-related arterial dysfunction. This review discusses both the initial observational evidence for the relationship of age-related inflammation and arterial dysfunction and the evidence that inflammatory autoimmune diseases are associated with a premature arterial ageing phenotype. We next discuss interventional and mechanistic evidence linking inflammation and age-related arterial dysfunction in older adults. We also attempt to summarize the relevant evidence from preclinical models. Lastly, we discuss interventions in both humans and animals that have been shown to ameliorate age-related arterial inflammation and dysfunction. The available evidence provides a strong basis for the role of inflammation in both large artery stiffening and impairment of endothelium-dependent dilatation; however, the specific inflammatory mediators, the initiating factors and the relative importance of the endothelium, smooth muscle cells, perivascular adipose tissue and immune cells in arterial inflammation are not well understood. With the expansion of the ageing population, ameliorating age-related arterial inflammation represents an important potential strategy for preserving vascular health in the elderly.

BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate adipogenesis but it is not clear whether they influence regional adipose tissue (AT) development in humans.OBJECTIVE: To characterise BMP2 expression, BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling, and BMP2's potential effect on proliferation and adipogenesis in human subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal AT and its constituent preadipocytes.METHODS: BMP2 expression was measured in whole AT and immortalised preadipocytes via qPCR and Western blot; secreted/circulating BMP2 was measured by ELISA. The effect of BMP2 on preadipocyte proliferation was evaluated using a fluorescent assay. BMP2's effect on adipogenesis in immortalised preadipocytes was determined via qPCR of adipogenic markers and cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling was assessed in immortalised preadipocytes via Western blot and qPCR of ID1 expression.RESULTS: BMP2 was expressed and released by abdominal and gluteal AT and preadipocytes. Exogenous BMP2 dose dependently promoted adipogenesis in abdominal preadipocytes only; 50<U+2009>ng/ml BMP2 increased PPARG2 expression (10-fold compared to vehicle, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and TAG accumulation (3-fold compared to vehicle; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). BMP2 stimulated SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and ID1 expression in abdominal and gluteal preadipocytes but this was blocked by 500<U+2009>nM K02288, a type 1 BMP receptor inhibitor (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Co-administration of 500<U+2009>nM K02288 also inhibited the pro-adipogenic effect of 50<U+2009>ng/ml BMP2 in abdominal cells; &gt;90% inhibition of TAG accumulation (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and ~50% inhibition of PPARG2 expression (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). The endogenous iron regulator erythroferrone reduced BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling by ~30% specifically in subcutaneous abdominal preadipocytes (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), suggesting it plays a role in restricting the expansion of the body's largest AT depot during energy deficiency. Additionally, a waist-hip ratio-increasing common polymorphism near BMP2 is an eQTL associated with ~15% lower BMP2 expression in abdominal and gluteal AT (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) as well as altered adipocyte size in male abdominal AT (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signalling in depot-specific preadipocyte development and abdominal AT expansion in humans.

An increase in adipose tissue is caused by the increased size and number of adipocytes. Lipids accumulate in intracellular stores, known as lipid droplets (LDs). Recent studies suggest that parameters such as LD size, shape and dynamics are closely related to the development of obesity. Berberine (BBR), a natural plant alkaloid, has been demonstrated to possess anti-obesity effects. However, it remains unknown which cellular processes are affected by this compound or how effective herbal extracts containing BBR and other alkaloids actually are. For this study, we used extracts of Coptis chinensis, Mahonia aquifolium, Berberis vulgaris and Chelidonium majus containing BBR and other alkaloids and studied various processes related to adipocyte functionality. The presence of extracts resulted in reduced adipocyte differentiation, as well as neutral lipid content and rate of lipolysis. We observed that the intracellular fatty acid exchange was reduced in different LD size fractions upon treatment with BBR and Coptis chinensis. In addition, LD motility was decreased upon incubation with BBR, Coptis chinensis and Chelidonium majus extracts. Furthermore, Chelidonium majus was identified as a potent fatty acid uptake inhibitor. This is the first study that demonstrates the selected regulatory effects of herbal extracts on adipocyte function.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning classification approach to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous regions within optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of breast tissue for potential use in an intraoperative setting for margin assessment.METHODS: A custom ultrahigh-resolution OCT (UHR-OCT) system with an axial resolution of 2.7 µm and a lateral resolution of 5.5 µm was used in this study. The algorithm used an A-scan-based classification scheme and the convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented using an 11-layer architecture consisting of serial 3<U+202F>×<U+202F>3 convolution kernels. Four tissue types were classified, including adipose, stroma, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive ductal carcinoma.RESULTS: The binary classification of cancer versus noncancer with the proposed CNN achieved 94% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. The mean five-fold validation F1 score was highest for invasive ductal carcinoma (mean standard deviation, 0.89 ± 0.09) and adipose (0.79 ± 0.17), followed by stroma (0.74 ± 0.18), and ductal carcinoma in situ (0.65 ± 0.15).CONCLUSION: It is feasible to use CNN based algorithm to accurately distinguish cancerous regions in OCT images. This fully automated method can overcome limitations of manual interpretation including interobserver variability and speed of interpretation and may enable real-time intraoperative margin assessment.

INTRODUCTION: Imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted from visceral adipose tissue (VAT) contributes to the pathogenesis of certain cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a form of VAT mainly concentrated along the coronary arteries. It has been shown in various studies that EAT thickness is positively correlated with cardiovascular disease. Due to its high worldwide prevalence, prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a major public health challenge. Metformin, the most widely prescribed drug to treat T2D, has favorable effects on VAT and body weight. As metformin decreases VAT mass, in this prospective study we analyzed the possible positive effect of metformin on EAT mass, which is organ-specific VAT, and body mass index (BMI).METHODS: Subjects were selected from patients admitted to the internal medicine outpatient clinic. Newly diagnosed T2D patients treated with metformin monotherapy were analyzed and 40 patients were included. EAT thickness in the included patients was measured echocardiographically. BMI and EAT thickness were analyzed at the beginning (BMI0 and EAT0) and after three months of metformin monotherapy (BMI3 and EAT3).RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in EAT thickness after three months of metformin monotherapy (EAT0=5.07±1.33 mm vs. EAT3=4.76±1.32 mm; p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, BMI was also significantly decreased (BMI0=28.27±2.71 vs. BMI3=27.29±2.10; p&lt;0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: In this study we show that metformin monotherapy significantly decreases EAT thickness and BMI in T2D patients. This suggests that metformin could reduce the frequency of coronary atherosclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Previous basic research and clinical studies examined the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on regeneration and maintenance of articular cartilage. However, our pilot study suggested that MSCs are more effective at suppressing inflammation and pain rather than promoting cartilage regeneration in osteoarthritis. Adipose tissue is considered a useful source of MSCs; it can be harvested easily in larger quantities compared with the bone marrow. The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and regenerative effects of intra-articularly injected processed lipoaspirate (PLA) cells (containing adipose-derived MSCs) on degenerative cartilage in a rat osteoarthritis model.RESULTS: The early injection group showed less cartilage degradation, whereas the late injection group showed cartilage damage similar to untreated OA group. The relative expression level of CGRP protein in DRG neurons was significantly lower in the two treatment groups, compared with the untreated group.CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular injection of PLA cells prevented degenerative changes in the early injection group, but had little effect in promoting cartilage repair in the late injection group. Interestingly, intra-articular injection of PLA cells resulted in suppression of inflammation and pain in both OA groups. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of intra-articular injection of PLA cells in osteoarthritis.

Experimental and human autopsy studies have associated adventitial lymphangiogenesis with atherosclerosis. An analysis of perivascular lymphangiogenesis in patients with coronary artery disease is lacking. Here, we examined lymphangiogenesis and its potential regulators in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding the heart (C-PVAT) and compared it with PVAT of the internal mammary artery (IMA-PVAT). Forty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were included. Perioperatively collected C-PVAT and IMA-PVAT were analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, real time PCR, and PVAT-conditioned medium using cytokine arrays. C-PVAT exhibited increased PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1)-positive vessel density. The number of lymphatic vessels expressing lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 or podoplanin was also elevated in C-PVAT and associated with higher inflammatory cell numbers, increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, and fibrosis. Significantly higher expression of regulators of lymphangiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF receptor-3 was observed in C-PVAT compared to IMA-PVAT. Cytokine arrays identified angiopoietin-2 as more highly expressed in C-PVAT vs. IMA-PVAT. Findings were confirmed histologically and at the mRNA level. Stimulation of human lymphatic endothelial cells with recombinant angiopoietin-2 in combination with VEGF-C enhanced sprout formation. Our study shows that PVAT surrounding atherosclerotic arteries exhibits more extensive lymphangiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis compared to PVAT surrounding a non-diseased vessel, possibly due to local angiopoietin-2, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D overexpression.

The study of the dielectric properties of tissues plays a key role in understanding the interaction between electromagnetic energy and the human body, for safety assessments of human exposure to electromagnetic fields, as well as for numerous biomedical applications such as Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). TTFields are low-intensity alternating electric fields in the 100-500 kHz frequency range, which have an antimitotic effect on cancerous cells. TTFields are delivered to the body through pairs of transducer arrays placed on a patient's skin in close proximity to the tumor. Therefore, it is essential to understand how the skin's dielectric properties affect TTFields delivery in clinical settings. In this paper, we present a study combining in vivo measurements with numerical simulations that elucidate how different layers of the skin influence TTFields distribution in the body. The dielectric properties of the skin were measured on volunteers using a setup that ensured skin conditions resembled those when TTFields are delivered to patients. The measured properties were incorporated into a realistic human computational phantom and delivery of TTFields to the phantom's abdomen was simulated. The total impedance of the simulated model was within the mid-range of impedance values measured in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with TTFields. A computational study investigating model sensitivity to the dielectric properties of the skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue showed that when skin conductivity increased above a threshold value, the total impedance of the model was largely insensitive to changes in the conductivity of these tissues. Furthermore, for a given current, the field intensity within the internal organs was mostly unaffected by skin properties but was highly sensitive to the conductivity of the organ itself. This study provides a new insight into the role of skin in determining the distribution of TTFields within the body.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a visceral AT, surrounding myocardium and coronary arteries. Its volume is higher in Type 2 diabetic (DM2) patients, associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyses triglycerides (TG) from circulating lipoproteins, supplying fatty acids to AT, contributing to its expansion. We aimed to evaluate LPL expression and activity in EAT from DM2 and no DM2 patients, and its regulators ANGPTL4, GPIHBP1 and PPAR<U+03B3> levels, together with VLDLR expression and EAT LPL association with VLDL characteristics.METHODS: We studied patients undergoing coronary by-pass graft (CABG) divided into CABG-DM2 (n<U+202F>=<U+202F>21) and CABG-noDM2 (n<U+202F>=<U+202F>29), and patients without CABG (No CABG, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>30). During surgery, EAT and subcutaneous AT (SAT) were obtained, in which LPL activity, gene and protein expression, its regulators and VLDLR protein levels were determined. Isolated circulating VLDLs were characterized.RESULTS: EAT LPL activity was higher in CABG-DM2 compared to CABG-noDM2 and No CABG (p=0.002 and p&lt;0.001) and in CABG-noDM2 compared to No CABG (p=0.02), without differences in its expression. ANGPTL4 levels were higher in EAT from No CABG compared to CABG-DM2 and CABG-noDM2 (p&lt;0.001). GPIHBP1 levels were higher in EAT from CABG-DM2 and CABG-noDM2 compared to No CABG (p= 0.04). EAT from CABG-DM2 presented higher PPAR<U+03B3> levels than CABG-noDM2 and No CABG (p=0.02 and p=0.03). No differences were observed in VLDL composition between groups, although EAT LPL activity was inversely associated with VLDL-TG and TG/protein index (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: EAT LPL regulation would be mainly post-translational. The higher LPL activity in DM2 could be partly responsible for the increase in EAT volume.

A reduction in the thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is presently discussed as a possible determinant for the development of obesity in humans. One group of endogenous factors that could potentially affect BAT activity is the glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol). We analyse here studies examining the effects of alterations in glucocorticoid signaling on BAT recruitment and thermogenic capacity. We find that irrespective of which manipulation of glucocorticoid signaling is examined, a seemingly homogeneous picture of lowered thermogenic capacity due to glucocorticoid stimulation is apparently obtained: e.g. lowered uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein levels per mg protein, and an increased lipid accumulation in BAT. However, further analyses generally indicate that these effects result from a dilution effect rather than a true decrease in total capacity; the tissue may thus be said to be in a state of pseudo-atrophy. However, under conditions of very low physiological stimulation of BAT, glucocorticoids may truly inhibit Ucp1 gene expression and consequently lower total UCP1 protein levels, but the metabolic effects of this reduction are probably minor. It is thus unlikely that glucocorticoids affect organismal metabolism and induce the development of obesity through alterations of BAT activity.

Obesity is associated with adipose inflammation, defined by macrophages encircling dead adipocytes, as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and increased risk of breast cancer. Whether ECM affects macrophage phenotype in obesity is uncertain. A better understanding of this relationship could be strategically important to reduce cancer risk or improve outcomes in the obese. Utilizing clinical samples, computational approaches, and in vitro decellularized ECM models, this study quantified the relative abundance of pro (M1)- and anti (M2)-inflammatory macrophages in human breast adipose tissue, determined molecular similarities between obesity and tumor-associated macrophages, and assessed the regulatory effect of obese versus lean ECM on macrophage phenotype. Our results suggest that breast adipose tissue contains more M2-biased than M1-biased macrophages across all body mass index (BMI) categories. Obesity further increased M2-biased macrophages but did not affect M1-biased macrophage density. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that breast tissue macrophages from obese versus lean women are more similar to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). These changes positively correlated with adipose tissue interstitial fibrosis, and in vitro experiments indicated that obese ECM directly stimulates M2-biased macrophage functions. However, mammographic density cannot be used as a clinical indicator of these changes. Collectively, these data suggest that obesity-associated interstitial fibrosis promotes a macrophage phenotype similar to TAMs, which may contribute to the link between obesity and breast cancer.

Cortisol administration during late gestation in ewes, modeling maternal stress, resulted in transcriptomic changes suggesting altered maturation and metabolic changes to the offspring heart. This study investigates the effects of cortisol on epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a visceral fat pad associated with adverse cardiovascular conditions in adults. Pregnant ewes were treated with either 1 mg/kg/day cortisol from 115 days gestation to term and EAT collected from term fetuses (control: n=8, maternal cortisol 1 mg/kg/day: n=6). To compare the effects of cortisol to the normal maturation in EAT, we also modeled the normal changes in gene expression in EAT at the transition from in utero to postnatal life using the EAT from control fetuses and from two-week-old lambs (control: n=7).), Transcriptomic modeling was used to identify pathways altered by maternal cortisol over-exposure. Transcriptomic modeling confirmed the brown fat phenotype of EAT at term and a transition towards white fat at two weeks of age in EAT of control fetuses/lambs, and highlighted a role of immune responses, including complement-coagulation, and serotonin in this transition. Maternal cortisol (1mg/kg/day) increased the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal in EAT of term fetuses, but did not affect the number of activated macrophages or size of the lipid droplets in the depot; transcriptomics suggested an earlier metabolic maturation of EAT via, in part, increased immune responses.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic positive energy balance leads to obesity, and the &quot;excess&quot; weight is usually described as consisting solely of adipose tissue (AT) or its two components, fat and fat-free mass (nonfat cell mass, extracellular fluid). This study aimed to clarify the nature of &quot;obesity&quot; tissue.RESULTS: AT significantly predicted organ-tissue mass in 17 of 18 multiple regression models. In addition to AT and skeletal muscle, the following associations were found: skin, liver, and bone were main contributors to obesity-tissue composition; liver, kidneys, and heart to resting energy expenditure; and skin, liver, and bone to metabolizable energy and protein contents. A pronounced sexual dimorphism was present in all three models.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is characterized not only by excess AT but by increases in the masses of other &quot;companion&quot; organs and tissues and their related metabolic properties.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global epidemic which is associated with several cardiometabolic comorbidities and is characterized by chronic, low grade systemic inflammation. Numerous biomarkers have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease, including transcription factors and coregulators. Steroid Receptor Coactivator (SRC)-family represent the master regulators of metabolic pathways and their dysregulation is strongly associated with numerous metabolic disorders.METHODS: 50 morbidly obese patients participated in the present study. Biopsies were collected from visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, extramyocellular adipose tissue and liver. We evaluated the differential protein expression of NFATc1, SRC-2/TIF-2, SRC-3/AIB-1 and inflammatory biomarkers CD68 and CD3 by immunohistochemistry. The current study was designed to determine any correlations between the transcription factor NFATc1 and the SRC coregulators, as well as any associations with the inflammatory biomarkers.RESULTS: We identified SRC-3 as a hepatic NFATc1 coactivator and we demonstrated its role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we revealed a complex and extensive inter- and intra-tissue network among the three main investigated proteins and the inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting their participation in the obesity-induced inflammatory cascade.CONCLUSIONS: Steroid receptor coactivators are critical regulators of human metabolism with pleiotropic and tissue-specific actions. We believe that our study will contribute to the better understanding of the complex multi-tissue interactions that are disrupted in obesity and can therefore lead in numerous cardiometabolic diseases. Further on, present findings suggest that SRC-3/AIB-1 could constitute possible future drug targets.

Adipose tissue has long been considered to be involved in tumor progression. However, the adipocyte-secreted molecular determinants that regulate hepatocellular cancer progression have not been defined yet. In this study, the expression pattern of exosome miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with high body fat ratio (BFR) were identified by using low-density microarray. And the targets of exosome-miRNAs in HCC cells were predicted by bioinformatics methods and verified by in vitro as well as in vivo experiments. Here, we show that microRNA-23a/b (miR-23a/b) was significantly upregulated in both serum exosomes and tumor tissues of HCC patients with a high body fat ratio than low BFR. Subsequently, in vitro studies suggested that miR-23a/b was most likely to be derived from adipocytes and was transported into cancer cells via exosomes, thus promoting HCC cell growth and migration. Meanwhile, exosome miR-23a and miR-23b confer chemoresistance by targeting the von Hippel-Lindau/hypoxia-inducible factor axis. Our study provides evidence in that high BFR-related exosome miR23-a/b is a promising target for future treatment of HCC.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of RA in participants of the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study.METHODS: The SOS is a longitudinal study aiming to assess the effect of bariatric surgery on mortality and obesity-related diseases. This report includes 2002 subjects with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and 2034 matched controls; none of them had RA at baseline. Cases of incident RA were identified through the Swedish National Patient Register by searching for International Classification of Diseases codes. Both intention-to-treat analyses and per-protocol analyses are reported. In the per-protocol analysis, participants from the control group who underwent bariatric surgery later on during follow-up were censored at the time of surgery.RESULTS: During follow-up, 92 study participants developed RA. The median follow-up was 21 years (range 0-29). Bariatric surgery was neither associated with the incidence of RA in the intention-to-treat analysis [hazard ratio (HR) 0.92 (95% CI 0.59, 1.46), P = 0.74], nor in the per-protocol analysis [HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.54, 1.38), P = 0.53]. Weight change at the 2 year follow-up, expressed as the change in BMI compared with baseline, did not associate with the development of RA. Higher serum CRP levels and smoking associated with the future development of RA independent of other factors.CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect any association between bariatric surgery and the incidence of RA in subjects affected by obesity followed up for up to 29 years.GOV: (http://clinicaltrials.gov): NCT01479452.

In many cases, obesity is associated with metabolic disorders. Recently, natural compounds that may be beneficial for improving obesity have received increasing attention. Bitter melon has received attention as a diabetes treatment. NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase (Sirtuin 1, SIRT1) has emerged as a novel therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. In this study, ethanol extract of bitter melon (BME) suppressed adipocyte differentiation and significantly increased the expression of SIRT1 in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Moreover, it enhanced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed induced-obesity mice, BME suppressed HFD-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue (WAT) weight. BME also increased the expression of SIRT1 and suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 expressions of WAT from HFD-fed mice. These findings suggest that BME prevents obesity by activating the SIRT1 and AMPK pathway and that it may be a useful dietary supplement for preventing obesity.

BACKGROUND: This study reported compliance with 24-hour physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines, and associations with adiposity in the first 2 years of life.METHODS: Participants (N = 119) were recruited from Soweto, South Africa. Visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was measured by ultrasound. Participation in 2 movement behaviors (physical activity and sedentary time) was reported by mothers. Differences in adiposity between those meeting each individual guideline, as well as the combination of both movement guidelines, compared with those not meeting the guidelines were assessed.RESULTS: Only 5% of infants met the sedentary guidelines; however, 58% met the physical activity guidelines. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was significantly higher in those meeting the physical activity guideline (0.50 [0.01] vs 0.47 [0.01] cm, P = .03) compared with those not meeting the guideline. Meeting the screen time component of the sedentary guideline was associated with higher visceral adipose tissue (ß = 0.96, P &lt; .01), while meeting one guideline compared with meeting none was associated with higher subcutaneous adipose tissue (ß = 0.05, P = .01).CONCLUSIONS: Most infants and toddlers from this low- to middle-income setting were not meeting sedentary behavior guidelines. Both behaviors were associated with abdominal adiposity, but not with body mass index z score; implying these movement behaviors may impact abdominal fat deposition rather than body size.

Kynurenic acid (KA) regulates energy homeostasis and alleviates inflammation in adipose tissue but how KA affects the atherosclerotic response in HUVECs remains unclear. We evaluated the effects of KA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and apoptosis in HUVECs. KA enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd) expression in HUVECs and THP-1<U+202F>cells and suppressed LPS-induced atherosclerotic responses through PPARd-mediated signaling. Moreover, KA treatment mitigated LPS-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in HUVECs and THP-1<U+202F>cells, and down-regulated adhesion molecules in HUVECs and adhesion of THP-1<U+202F>cells to HUVECs following LPS treatment. KA treatment decreased LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis, and also promoted heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression, which suppresses inflammation in HUVECs. Suppression of PPARd or HO-1 expression markedly mitigated the effects of KA on atherosclerotic responses in HUVECs. Thus, KA attenuates LPS-induced atherosclerotic responses by suppressing inflammation via the PPARd/HO-1-dependent pathway.

Effective control of white adipose tissue accumulation would provide a therapeutic strategy for obesity, which poses a growing global problem. The plant chemical mangiferin stimulates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits adipogenesis and has therefore been considered a therapeutic target for obesity and related diseases. We previously reported the anti-inflammatory properties of 6'-O-acetyl mangiferin (OAM). In this study, we evaluated the potential of OAM as an AMPK activator in vitro in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. OAM inhibited adipogenesis as indicated by lower intracellular lipid and triglyceride accumulation as well as reduced adipogenic gene and protein expression upon treatment. OAM-treated 3T3-L1 cells excreted more glycerol, indicating increased lipolysis, which was supported by increased expression of lipolysis-related genes, including adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. We determined that OAM upregulates lipolysis via phosphorylation-dependent activation of AMPK. Further, OAM upregulated the ß-oxidation pathway as indicated by enhanced expression of phosphorylated acetyl-CoA-carboxylase and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1. In conclusion, OAM markedly decreased intracellular lipid accumulation by enhancing lipolysis via AMPK activation and by upregulating ß-oxidation. Thus, OAM has potential as a drug for the prevention and/or improvement of obesity and related diseases and deserves further study.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein coding RNAs and post-transcriptionally regulate cellular gene expression. In animal development, miRNAs play essential roles such as stem cell maintenance, organogenesis, and apoptosis. Using gain-of-function (GOF) screening with 160 miRNA lines in Drosophila melanogaster, we identified a set of miRNAs which regulates body fat contents and named them microCATs (microRNAs Controlling Adipose Tissue). Further examination of egg-to-adult developmental kinetics of selected miRNA lines showed a negative correlation between fat content and developmental time. Comparison of microCATs with loss-of-function miRNA screening data uncovered miR-969 as an essential regulator of adiposity. Subsequently, we demonstrated adipose tissue-specific knock-down of gustatory receptor 47b (Gr47b), a miR-969 target, greatly reduced the amount of body fat, recapitulating the miR-969 GOF phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia represents a central obstacle in medical oncology as it is associated with poor therapy response and reduced overall survival. Systemic inflammation is considered to be a key driver of cancer cachexia; however, clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs failed to show distinct cachexia-inhibiting effects. To address this contradiction, we investigated the functional importance of innate immune cells for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated cachexia.METHODS: A transgenic HCC mouse model was intercrossed with mice harbouring a defect in myeloid cell-mediated inflammation. Body composition of mice was analysed via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and microcomputed tomography. Quantitative PCR was used to determine adipose tissue browning and polarization of adipose tissue macrophages. The activation state of distinct areas of the hypothalamus was analysed via immunofluorescence. Multispectral immunofluorescence imaging and immunoblot were applied to characterize sympathetic neurons and macrophages in visceral adipose tissue. Quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum was performed with a multiplex immunoassay. Visceral adipose tissue of HCC patients was quantified via the L3 index of computed tomography scans obtained during routine clinical care.RESULTS: We identified robust cachexia in the HCC mouse model as evidenced by a marked loss of visceral fat and lean mass. Computed tomography-based analyses demonstrated that a subgroup of human HCC patients displays reduced visceral fat mass, complementing the murine data. While the myeloid cell-mediated inflammation defect resulted in reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of HCC-bearing mice, this unexpectedly did not translate into diminished but rather enhanced cachexia-associated fat loss. Defective myeloid cell-mediated inflammation was associated with decreased macrophage abundance in visceral adipose tissue, suggesting a role for local macrophages in the regulation of cancer-induced fat loss.CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid cell-mediated inflammation displays a rather unexpected beneficial function in a murine HCC model. These results demonstrate that immune cells are capable of protecting the host against cancer-induced tissue wasting, adding a further layer of complexity to the pathogenesis of cachexia and providing a potential explanation for the contradictory results of clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs.

The immunogenic collagen V (Col V) and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. Col V is also up-regulated during adipogenesis and can stimulate adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Conditioned medium (CM) generated from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduces bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury in rats, suggesting a crucial role in situ of immunomodulatory factors secreted by MSCs in these beneficial effects. In the present work, we investigated this hypothesis, analyzing levels of plasma inflammatory mediators and inflammatory and fibrotic mediators in the lung tissue of BLM-injured rats after treatment with MSCs and CM. Pulmonary fibrosis was intratracheally induced by BLM. After 10 days, BLM animals were further randomized into subgroups receiving saline, MSCs, or CM intravenously. On days 14 and 21, the animals were euthanized, and the lungs were examined through protein expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), IL-17, transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß), vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin-1, and the immunogenic Col V through histological quantitative evaluation and plasma levels of fibrinogen, Von Willebrand factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Rats that had been injected with MSCs and CM showed a significant increase in weight and significant improvements at 14 and 21 days after intravenous injection at both time points of analysis of plasma fibrinogen, PDGF, and Von Willebrand factor and NOS-2 expression, supporting an early anti-inflammatory action, thus reducing TGF-ß and collagen I fibers. In contrast, intravenous injection of CM was able to significantly increase the deposition of Col V fibers and IL-17 on both day 14 and day 21 as compared with the amount observed in rats from the BLM group and MSC groups. In conclusion, this study reinforces previous observations on the therapeutic properties of MSCs and CM and is the first report to demonstrate the association of its actions with immunomodulatory biomarkers on lung tissue. We concluded that adipose-derived stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells-CM modulate an in situ imbalance between collagen I- and Col V-mediated IL-17 immune response, emerging as a promising therapeutic option for recovering from BLM pulmonary fibrosis.

Panniculitis is a heterogeneous group of diseases that are characterized by a subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) lesion and frequently occur with involvement of the musculoskeletal system and viscera in the process. This is a chronic multiple organ disease. The gold standard for its diagnosis is noted to be a morphological study. The paper presents the current classification of panniculitis.OBJECTIVE: To study the morphological features of idiopathic lobular panniculitis (ILP) in accordance with the nature of the course and clinical forms of the disease.RESULTS: The nature of the morphological parameters of the disease corresponded to the course of ILP. The acute course of the disease was characterized by the predominance of liponecrosis and inflammation concurrent with productive-destructive vasculitis. In the chronic course, there was a preponderance of lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with gigantic macrophages (lipophages) and granuloma-like structures. The above morphological changes were characteristic of the phagocytic morphological stage of node formation. The fibroplastic stage of panniculitis was absent in this study. The morphological features of the disease were shown depending on the form of idiopathic lobular panniculitis, which may be of diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of panniculitis.CONCLUSION: The pathologist must first of all pay attention to the preferential localization of pathological changes (in the SAT septa or slices), the presence or absence of vasculitis and the nature of the infiltrate. The skin in panniculitis is typically intact or has minimal changes following the pattern seen in reactive ones. Panniculitis shows an undulatory course, and therefore all signs of this disease are present in biopsy specimens; however, morphological signs of the acute inflammatory, lipophagic or fibroplastic stage of the disease predominate depending on the stage and activity of the process.

Although the first description of a syndrome defined by the co-existence of atherogenic and diabetogenic metabolic abnormalities is debated in the literature, it was Gerald Reaven who proposed, in his landmark 1988 Banting award lecture, that a significant proportion of individuals (with diabetes or not) were characterised by insulin resistance causing prejudice to cardiovascular health. However, Reaven was influenced by seminal observations made more than 50 years earlier by Himsworth who proposed that there were two forms of diabetes (insulin resistant v. insulin sensitive). Reaven went further in proposing the theory that insulin resistance was the most prevalent cause of CVD associated with metabolic abnormalities that he named syndrome X. Because there was a syndrome X documented in cardiology, the term evolved to insulin resistance syndrome. As Reaven could also find insulin-resistant individuals in non-obese subjects, he did not include obesity as a feature of syndrome X. Imaging studies then revealed that excess adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity, a condition described as visceral obesity, was the form of overweight/obesity associated with insulin resistance and its related abnormalities. As obesity risk assessment and management remain largely based on body weight (BMI) and weight loss, it is proposed that our clinical approaches and public health messages should be revisited. First, patients should be educated about the importance of monitoring their waistline as a crude index of abdominal adiposity. Secondly, public health approaches focussing on 'lifestyle vital signs' including achieving healthy waistlines rather than healthy body weights should be developed.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine if deleting the gene encoding glutaredoxin-2 (GRX2) could protect mice from diet-induced weight gain.RESULTS: Subjecting WT littermates to a high fat diet (HFD) induced a significant increase in overall body mass, white adipose tissue hypertrophy, lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes, and higher circulating insulin and triglyceride levels. In contrast, GRX2 heterozygotes (GRX2+/-) fed a HFD had a body mass, white adipose tissue weight, and hepatic and circulating lipid and insulin levels similar to littermates fed a control diet (CD). Examination of the bioenergetics of muscle mitochondria revealed that this protective effect was associated with an increase in respiration and proton leaks. Muscle mitochondria from GRX2+/- mice had a ~2-3 fold increase in state 3 (phosphorylating) respiration when pyruvate/malate or succinate served as substrates and a ~4-fold increase when palmitoyl-carnitine was being oxidized. Proton leaks were ~2-3-fold higher in GRX2+/- muscle mitochondria. Treatment of mitochondria with either GDP, genipin, or octanoyl-carnitine revealed that the higher rate of O2 consumption under state 4 conditions was associated with increased leaks through uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). GRX2+/- mitochondria also had better protection from oxidative distress.INNOVATION: For the first time, we demonstrate that deleting the Grx2 gene can protect from diet-induced weight gain and the development of obesity-related disorders.CONCLUSIONS: Deleting the Grx2 gene protects mice from diet-induced weight gain. This effect was related to an increase in muscle fuel combustion, mitochondrial respiration, proton leaks, and ROS handling.

The expression levels of many genes change after treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects by antiretroviral drugs. High-throughput analysis of tremendous datasets led to the discovery of genes that are implicated in the treatment pathways. In this study, we performed a gene-enrichment analysis after determining the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between untreated HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects and also between treated HIV-positive subjects with antiretroviral therapy (ART; who receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART) and untreated HIV-positive cases in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), adipose, and muscle tissues. In sum, the genes that activate inflammatory, immune response, proliferation, metabolism, and viral involvement pathways have different expression patterns in the untreated HIV-positive subjects and treated HIV-positive cases. Moreover, the expression levels of the genes including ACLY, ALDH18A1, HADHA, and YARS in the PBMCs tissue and HBEGF, PKN3, DEGS2, and EDN3 in the fat tissue were found to be different in the HIV-infected patients, which can be considered as new biomarkers for HIV infection.

HYPOTHESIS: To treat obesity and related diseases, considerable effort has gone into developing strategies to convert white adipocytes into thermogenic brown-like adipocytes ('browning'). The purpose of this study was to identify the most efficient signal control for browning.METHODS: To identify the most efficient signal control for browning, we examined rat stromal vascular fraction cells. In addition, physiological changes consequent to signal control were examined in vivo using lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice.RESULTS: Combined treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) agonist rosiglitazone, the SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3 and the adrenergic receptor agonist noradrenaline (norepinephrine) synergistically induced Ucp1, Fgf21 and Cited1 expression, triggering brown adipogenesis. Synergistic induction of Ucp1 by the three agents was negatively regulated by forkhead box O (FOXO)3 via the inhibition of PPAR<U+03B3>-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, the administration of rosiglitazone, SIS3 and the selective ß3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 to DIO mice reduced the amount of body-fat deposits (body weight from day 0 to 14, 12.3% reduction), concomitant with morphological changes in white adipose tissue, an increase in mitochondrial biosynthesis and a marked induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Furthermore, administration of the three agents significantly increased serum adiponectin levels (mean 65.56 µg/ml with the three agents vs 20.79 µg/ml in control mice, p &lt;<U+2009>0.05) and improved glucose and lipid tolerance.INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the combined regulation of PPAR<U+03B3>, SMAD and the adrenergic receptor signalling pathway synergistically induces brown adipogenesis and may serve as an effective strategy to treat obesity and related diseases, including type 2 diabetes.

PURPOSE: Lowering of LDL cholesterol levels by plant sterols and stanols is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. Plant sterols and stanols also lower triacylglycerol (TG). However, it is not fully understood how reduction in TG is achieved and what the full potential of plant sterols and stanols is on whole-body metabolism. We here hypothesize that high levels of plant sterols and stanols stimulate whole-body energy expenditure, which can be attributed to changes in mitochondrial function of brown adipose tissue (BAT), skeletal muscle and liver.METHODS: Phytosterolemic mice were fed chow diets for 32 weeks to examine whole-body weight gain. In vitro, 24-h incubation were performed in adipocytes derived from human BAT, human myotubes or HepG2 human hepatocytes using sitosterol or sitostanol. Following mitochondrial function was assessed using seahorse bioanalyzer.RESULTS: Chow feeding in phytosterolemic mice resulted in diminished increase in body weight compared to control mice. In vitro, sitosterol or sitostanol did not change mitochondrial function in adipocytes derived from human BAT or in cultured human myotubes. Interestingly, maximal mitochondrial function in HepG2 human hepatocytes was decreased following sitosterol or sitostanol incubation, however, only when mitochondrial function was assessed in low glucose-containing medium.CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial in vivo effects of plant sterols and stanols on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are well recognized. Our results indicate that alterations in human mitochondrial function are apparently not involved to explain these beneficial effects.

Targeting residual cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention, would allow deployment of novel therapeutic agents, facilitating precision medicine. For example, lowering vascular inflammation is a promising strategy to reduce the residual inflammatory cardiovascular risk in patients already receiving optimal medical therapy, but prescribing novel anti-inflammatory treatments will be problematic due to the lack of specific companion diagnostic tests, to guide their targeted use in clinical practice. Currently available tests for the detection of coronary inflammation are either non-specific for the cardiovascular system (e.g. plasma biomarkers) or expensive and not readily available (e.g. hybrid positron emission tomography imaging). Recent technological advancements in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allow non-invasive detection of high-risk plaque features (positive remodelling, spotty calcification, low attenuation plaque, and napkin-ring sign) and help identify the vulnerable patient, but they provide only indirectly information about coronary inflammation. Perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI), a novel method for assessing coronary inflammation by analysing routine CCTA, captures changes in the perivascular adipose tissue composition driven by inflammatory signals coming from the inflamed coronary artery, by analysing the three-dimensional gradients of perivascular attenuation, followed by adjustments for technical, anatomical, and biological factors. By detecting vascular inflammation, perivascular FAI enhances cardiovascular risk discrimination which could aid more cost-effective deployment of novel therapeutic agents. In this article, we present the existing non-invasive modalities for the detection of coronary inflammation and provide a practical guide for their use in clinical practice.

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that is increasingly being recognized as a disease that not only affects the skin but also has multi-systemic implications. The pathophysiological link between psoriasis and obesity is becoming increasingly elucidated by recent studies. The cross-talk between adipocytes and the immune system via various mediators such as adipokines could explain how obesity contributes to psoriasis. The effects of obesity on adipocytes include upregulation of pro-inflammatory adipokines such as leptin and resistin, downregulation of anti-inflammatory adipokine, and also the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages. This article provides an update on the role of adipose tissues in psoriasis.

The mechanisms by which obesity may alter immune responses to pathogens are poorly understood. The present study assessed whether the intrinsic responsiveness of resident macrophages to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is reprogrammed in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Macrophages from adipose tissue, lung alveoli, and the peritoneal cavity were extracted from obese rats on a HFD or from their lean counterparts, and subsequently studied in culture under identical conditions. CD45<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> cells (macrophages) were abundant in all cultures, and became the main producers of TNF-a upon LPS stimulation. But although all macrophage subpopulations responded to LPS with an M1-like profile of cytokine secretion, the TNF-a/IL-10 ratio was the lowest in adipose tissue macrophages, the highest in alveolar macrophages, and intermediary in peritoneal macrophages. What is more, diet exerted qualitatively distinct effects on the cytokine responses to LPS, with obesity switching adipose tissue macrophages to a more pro-inflammatory program and peritoneal macrophages to a less pro-inflammatory program, while not affecting alveolar macrophages. Such reprogramming was not associated with changes in the inflammasome-dependent secretion of IL-1ß. The study further shows that the effects of diet on TNF-a/IL-10 ratios were linked to distinct patterns of NF-<U+03BA>B accumulation in the nucleus: while RelA was the NF-<U+03BA>B subunit most impacted by obesity in adipose tissue macrophages, cRel was the subunit affected in peritoneal macrophages. It is concluded that obesity causes dissimilar, site-specific changes in the responsiveness of resident macrophages to bacterial LPS. Such plasticity opens new avenues of investigation into the mechanisms linking obesity to pathogen-induced immune responses.

Excessive white adipose tissue (WAT) accumulation due to an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure (EE) characterizes obesity. However, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is highly specialized for the dissipation of energy. Recent evidence indicated that the activation of BAT and the induction of WAT browning might be promising approaches to combat obesity by increasing EE and regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Resveratrol, which is a polyphenolic compound, has been widely acknowledged to have protective effects against obesity and related metabolic disorders. The induction of WAT browning has been considered as one of the crucial factors in the metabolic benefits of resveratrol. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism that is involved is largely unclear. As a prebiotic-like polyphenol, resveratrol is able to modulate the composition of gut microbiota. In addition, in recent years, the impact of gut microbiota on the browning of WAT has received increasing attention and has been initially confirmed to play a role. By considering all these factors, this review explores the potential link between dietary resveratrol and the browning of WAT, which may be modulated by gut microbiota and their metabolites and proposes the &quot;gut microbiota- adipose tissue&quot; axis plays a vital role in the anti-obesity effects of resveratrol. This observation might provide novel insights and targets that could be used for fighting against obesity and associated metabolic disorders.

Obesity is a new risk factor, to which more and more research is devoted, related to the development of cancer. Many studies of recent years have drawn attention to the role of adipose tissue as an important internal endocrine organ. In the adipose tissue proteins are produced, referred to by the common name as adipokines. In the case of obesity, the neoplasm cells are constantly stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines, among which leptin dominates. The studies show that leptin can affect the cancer cells through numerous phenomena, e.g. inflammation, cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis and angiogenesis. In this literature review we examined the role of leptin in the development of the individual cancers: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and brain neoplasms: glioma and meningioma. However, leptin has very complicated mechanisms of action which require better understanding in certain types of cancer.

Dysfunctional epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) secretome can influence the heart's stretch response. However, the molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to clarify how dysfunctional EAT promotes maladaptive heart remodeling in cardiovascular disease (CVD) through ST2 production associated with exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) proteins. A series of 55 CVD males were enrolled and their EAT thickness, LV mass and volumes were measured by echocardiography. Blood, plasma and EAT biopsies were collected for molecular and proteomic assays. Taking EAT thickness as a continuous variable there was a direct correlation between the ST2 cardiac stretch mediator and EAT thickness (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.54, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and an inverse relation between the ST2 gene and IL-33 expression (r -0.50, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). In the CVD population EPAC2 expression directly correlated with the ST2 gene (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.74, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.0001) causing an ST2/IL-33 system local (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and systemic (sST2<U+2009>=<U+2009>57.33<U+2009>±<U+2009>3.22 and IL-33<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.53<U+2009>±<U+2009>017<U+2009>pg/mL; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.0001) protein imbalance associated with maladaptive remodeling. This indicated that dysfunctional EAT is a source of both EPAC and ST2 protein and an EPAC2 isoform seems involved in ST2 production in adipose tissue. Both EPAC2 and ST2 expression were directly related to maladaptive heart remodeling indices, suggesting EAT measurements could be useful in the early assessment of CVD complications.

BACKGROUND: Over 50% of acute stroke patients have hyperglycemia, which is associated with a poorer prognosis and outcome. Our aim was to investigate the impact of hyperglycemia on behavioral recovery and brain repair of delivered human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs) in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).RESULTS: The hyperglycemic group exhibited more severe neurological deficits; lesion size and diffusion coefficient were larger compared with the non-hyperglycemic rats. GFAP, Iba-1, and a-SMA were increased in the hyperglycemic group. The hyperglycemic rats administered hAD-MSCs at 48<U+2009>h after pMCAO had improved neurological impairment. Although T2-MRI did not show differences in lesion size between groups, the rADC values were lower in the treated group. Finally, the levels of GFAP, Iba-1, and arterial wall thickness were lower in the treated hyperglycemic group than in the nontreated hyperglycemic group at 6<U+2009>weeks post-stroke.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that rats with hyperglycemic ischemic stroke exhibit increased lesion size and impaired brain repair processes, which lead to impairments in behavioral recovery after pMCAO. More importantly, hAD-MSC administration induced better anatomical tissue preservation, associated with a good behavioral outcome.

Supplying oxygen to inner areas of cell constructs to support cell proliferation and metabolism is a major challenge in tissue engineering involving stem cells. Developing devices that incorporate oxygen release materials to increase the availability of the localized oxygen supply is therefore key to addressing this limitation. Herein, we designed and developed a 3D-printed oxygen-releasing device composed of an alginate hydrogel scaffold combined with an oxygen-generating biomaterial (calcium peroxide) to improve the oxygen supply of the microenvironment for culturing adipose tissue-derived stem cells. The results demonstrated that the 3D-printed oxygen-releasing device alleviated hypoxia, maintained oxygen availability, and ensured proliferation of the embedded cells, whilst also reducing hypoxia-induced apoptosis. The introduction of this 3D-printed oxygen-releasing device could enhance the survival of embedded stem cells.

Exquisite regulation of energy homeostasis protects from nutrient deprivation but causes metabolic dysfunction upon nutrient excess. In human and murine adipose tissue, the accumulation of ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) accompanies obesity, implicating this receptor in energy metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that mice bearing global- or adipocyte-specific deletion of Ager, the gene encoding RAGE, display superior metabolic recovery after fasting, a cold challenge, or high-fat feeding. The RAGE-dependent mechanisms were traced to suppression of protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of its key targets, hormone-sensitive lipase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, upon ß-adrenergic receptor stimulation-processes that dampen the expression and activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and thermogenic programs. This work identifies the innate role of RAGE as a key node in the immunometabolic networks that control responses to nutrient supply and cold challenges, and it unveils opportunities to harness energy expenditure in environmental and metabolic stress.

Previous researches have emphasized on suitability of decellularized tissues for regenerative applications. The decellularization of cartilage tissue has always been a challenge as the final product must be balanced in both immunogenic residue and mechanical properties. This study was designed to compare and optimize the efficacy of the most common chemical decellularization treatments on articular cartilage. Freeze/thaw cycles, Trypsin, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and Triton-X 100 were used at various concentrations and time durations for decellularization of bovine distal femoral joint cartilage samples. Histological staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), DNA quantification, compressive strength test, and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were performed for evaluation of the decellularized cartilage samples. Treatment with 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA for one day followed by 3% SDS for two days and 3% Triton X-100 for another 2 days resulted in significant reduction in DNA content and simultaneous maintenance of mechanical properties. Seeding the human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) onto the decellularized cartilage confirmed its biocompatibility. According to our findings, an optimized physiochemical decellularization method can yield in a non-immunogenic biomechanically compatible decellularized tissue for cartilage regeneration application.

Oro-facial fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma;SSc) has a major impact on mouth function, facial appearance, and patient quality of life. Lipotransfer is a method of reconstruction that can be used in the treatment of oro-facial fibrosis. The effect of this treatment not only restores oro-facial volume but has also been found to reverse the effects of oro-facial fibrosis. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) within the engrafted adipose tissue have been shown to be anti-fibrotic in SSc and are proposed as the mechanism of the anti-fibrotic effect of lipotransfer. A cohort of 62 SSc patients with oro-facial fibrosis were assessed before and after stem cell enriched lipotransfer treatment. Clinical evaluation included assessment of mouth function using a validated assessment tool (Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Scale-MHISS), validated psychological measurements and pre and post-operative volumetric assessment. In addition, to understand the mechanism by which the anti-fibrotic effect of ADSCs occur, SSc derived fibroblasts and ADSCs from this cohort of patients were co-cultured in direct and indirect culture systems and compared to monoculture controls. Cell viability, DNA content, protein secretion of known fibrotic mediators including growth factor- ß1 (TGF ß-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) using ELISA analysis and fibrosis gene expression using a fibrosis pathway specific qPCR array were evaluated. Mouth function (MHISS) was significantly improved (6.85±5.07) (p&lt;0.0001) after treatment. All psychological measures were significantly improved: DAS 24 (12.1±9.5) (p&lt;0.0001); HADS-anxiety (2.8±3.2) (p&lt;0.0001), HADS-depression (2.0±3.1) (p&lt;0.0001); BFNE (2.9 ± 4.3) (p&lt;0.0001); VAS (3.56±4.1) (p&lt;0.0001). Multiple treatments further improved mouth function (p&lt;0.05), DAS (p&lt;0.0001) and VAS (p = 0.01) scores. SSc fibroblast viability and proliferation was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture via a paracrine effect over 14 days (p &lt; 0.0001). Protein secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF-ß1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture (p &lt; 0.0001). Multiple fibrosis associated genes were down regulated in SSc co-culture compared to monoculture after 14 days including Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMMP-8), Platelet derived growth factor-ß (PDGF-ß) and Integrin Subunit Beta 6 (ITG-ß6). Autologous stem cell enriched lipotransfer significantly improved the effects of oro-facial fibrosis in SSc in this open cohort study. Lipotransfer may reduce dermal fibrosis through the suppression of fibroblast proliferation and key regulators of fibrogenesis including TG-ß1 and CTGF. Our findings warrant further investigation in a randomised controlled trial.

PURPOSE: Obesity, substantially increasing the risk of diseases such as metabolic diseases, becomes a major health challenge. In this study, we, therefore, investigated the effect of modified apple polysaccharide (MAP) on obesity.METHODS: Twelve male C57BL/6J mice were given a 45% high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to replicate an obesity model and six mice were given normal diet as control. Then, 1 g/kg MAP was administrated to six mice by gavage for 15 days. Illumina Miseq PE300 sequencing platform was used to analyze the microbial diversity of fecal samples. Flow cytometry was employed to investigate the effects of MAP on immune cells in adipose tissue. Bacterial culture and qPCR were used to assess the effects of MAP on the growth of whole fecal bacteria and representative microbiota in vitro.RESULTS: MAP could alleviate HFD-induced obesity and decrease body weight of mice effectively. The results of a diversity showed that Shannon index in HFD group was significantly lower than that in control group; Shannon index in MAP group was higher than that in HFD group. The results of ß diversity showed that the microbiota of MAP group was more similar to that of control group. HFD increased the number of T cells and macrophages in adipocytes; while MAP decreased the number of T cells and macrophages. MAP could promote the growth of fecal bacteria, and demonstrated a facilitated effect on the proliferation of Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and an inhibitory effect on Fusobacterium.CONCLUSIONS: MAP could reduce HFD-induced obesity of mice effectively. The possible mechanisms are that MAP restored HFD-induced intestinal microbiota disorder, downregulated the number of T cells and macrophages in adipose tissue.

The increased prevalence of obesity significantly affects human health worldwide. Improvement of glycometabolism by dietotherapy/herbal remedy is an effective approach to ameliorate obesity. In this study, high-fat-diet induced obese (DIO) mice were treated with mulberry leaves for 13 weeks. The results showed that mulberry leaves significantly alleviated adiposity of DIO mice including reducing body weight gain, fat accumulation and fasting blood glucose, and improving insulin sensitivity. In addition, mulberry leaves had protective effects on liver and kidneys. The abundant flavonoids, polyphenols and 1-deoxynojirimycin in mulberry leaves were likely responsible for their beneficial effects. Mechanistically, we found that mulberry leaves could alleviate obesity by enhancing brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity partly indicated by elevated thermogenesis and overexpression of uncoupling protein 1 in BAT. Moreover, mulberry leaves significantly increased the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and Akkermansia level that were closely associated with obesity development and progression, and decreased the potential proinflammatory Proteobacteria in feces. These findings reveal that the mulberry leaf is an edible plant food with therapeutic potential for obesity and may provide dietotherapy/herbal remedy to the treatment of obesity and its complications.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induces the loss of cell-cell interactions in polarized epithelial cells and converts these cells to invasive mesenchymal-like cells. It is also involved in tissue fibrosis including that occurring in some ocular surface diseases such as pterygium and in subepithelial corneal fibrosis in limbal stem cell deficiency. Here, we examined the effects of the secretome of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) on EMT in human corneal epithelial cells (CECs).</AbstractText>: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induces the loss of cell-cell interactions in polarized epithelial cells and converts these cells to invasive mesenchymal-like cells.

Obesity is associated with ~40% of cancer diagnoses but there are currently no effective preventive strategies, illustrating a need for chemoprevention. We previously demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) from adipose tissue stimulates malignant transformation, as measured by growth in soft agar, the gold-standard in vitro transformation assay. Because the soft agar assay is unsuitable for high throughput screens (HTS), we developed a novel method using 3D growth in ultra-low attachment conditions as an alternative to growth in agar to discover compounds that inhibit transformation. Treating non-tumorigenic, skin epithelial JB6 P<sup>+</sup> cells with FGF2 stimulates growth in ultra-low attachment conditions analogous to growth in the soft agar. This transformation HTS identified picropodophyllin, an insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor, and fluvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, as potential chemopreventive agents. These compounds were validated for efficacy using two non-tumorigenic cell lines in soft agar. Another IGF1R inhibitor and other statins were also tested and several were able to inhibit growth in soft agar. This novel 3D HTS platform is fast, robust and has the potential to identify agents for obesity-associated cancer prevention.

The use of porous scaffolds created by additive manufacturing is considered a viable approach for the regeneration of critical-size bone defects. This paper investigates the xenotransplantation of polycaprolactone (PCL) tissue constructs seeded with differentiated and undifferentiated human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) to treat calvarial critical-sized defect in Wistar rats. PCL scaffolds without cells were also considered. In vitro and in vivo biological evaluations were performed to assess the feasibility of these different approaches. In the case of cell seeded scaffolds, it was possible to observe the presence of hADSCs in the rat tissue contributing directly (osteoblasts) and indirectly (stimulation by paracrine factors) to tissue formation, organization and mineralization. The presence of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in the rat tissue treated with cell-seeded PCL scaffolds suggests that the paracrine factors of undifferentiated hADSC cells could stimulate BMP-2 production by surrounding cells, leading to osteogenesis. Moreover, BMP-2 acts synergistically with growth factors to induce angiogenesis, leading to higher numbers of blood vessels in the groups containing undifferentiated and differentiated hADSCs.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of arachidonic acid (AA)-rich ARASCO oil on high-fat diet (HFD)<U+202F>+<U+202F>streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus in male Wistar rats and its possible mechanisms of action.METHODS: Male Wistar rats with HFD<U+202F>+<U+202F>STZ-induced diabetes were employed in the present study. ARASCO oil was administered orally for the first 7 d consecutively, followed by once weekly throughout the study (14 wk). At various time points, blood glucose and body weight and oral glucose tolerance tests were measured. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed to collect plasma and various organs and stored at -80°C. Plasma insulin, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and lipoxin A4 were measured. Expression of the following genes was determined: nuclear factor-<U+03BA><U+0392> (NF-<U+03BA>B), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) in pancreas and lipocalin 2 (LPCLN2) in adipose tissue. Various antioxidants were measured in the plasma and other tissues. Area under the curve and insulin sensitivity index were assessed by computing homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance, quantitative insulin check index, Matsuda, and Belfiore indices.RESULTS: ARASCO oil treatment decreased hyperglycemia, restored insulin sensitivity, suppressed inflammation, enhanced plasma lipoxin A4 levels, and reversed altered antioxidant status to near normal in animals with HFD<U+202F>+<U+202F>STZ-induced diabetes.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ARASCO, a rich source of AA, can prevent HFD<U+202F>+<U+202F>STZ-induced diabetes in Wistar rats owing to its anti-inflammatory action. It remains to be seen whether ARASCO oil is useful in preventing or postponing the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.

BACKGROUND: The fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) rs9939609 A-allele has been associated with obesity risk. Although the exact mechanisms involved remain unknown, the FTO rs9939609 A-allele has been associated with an impaired postprandial suppression of appetite.OBJECTIVES: To explore the influence of FTO rs9939609 genotype on fasting and postprandial appetite-related hormones and perceived appetite in a heterogeneous sample of men and women.DESIGN: 112 healthy men and women aged 18-50-years-old completed three laboratory visits for the assessment of FTO rs9939609 genotype, body composition, aerobic fitness, resting metabolic rate, visceral adipose tissue, liver fat, fasting leptin, and fasting and postprandial acylated ghrelin, total PYY, insulin, glucose and perceived appetite. Participants wore accelerometers for seven consecutive days for the assessment of physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Multivariable general linear models quantified differences between FTO rs9939609 groups for fasting and postprandial appetite outcomes, with and without the addition of a priori selected physiological and behavioural covariates. Sex-specific univariable Pearson's correlation coefficients were quantified between the appetite-related outcomes and individual characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: Associations between the FTO rs9939609 genotype and fasting or postprandial appetite-related outcomes were weak in healthy men and women.

The synthesis of lipid and sterol species through de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is regulated by two functionally overlapping but distinct transcription factors: the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). ChREBP is considered to be the dominant regulator of DNL in adipose tissue (AT); however, the SREBPs are highly expressed and robustly regulated in adipocytes, suggesting that the model of AT DNL may be incomplete. Here we describe a new mouse model of inducible, adipocyte-specific overexpression of the insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig1), a negative regulator of SREBP transcriptional activity. Contrary to convention, Insig1 overexpression did block AT lipogenic gene expression. However, this was immediately met with a compensatory mechanism triggered by redox activation of mTORC1 to restore SREBP1 DNL gene expression. Thus, we demonstrate that SREBP1 activity sustains adipocyte lipogenesis, a conclusion that has been elusive due to the constitutive nature of current mouse models.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory peptide that is upregulated in obesity. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that ET-1 signaling promotes visceral adipose tissue (AT) inflammation and disrupts glucose homeostasis. We also tested if reduced ET-1 is a required mechanism by which exercise ameliorates AT inflammation and improves glycemic control in obesity. We found that (i) diet-induced obesity, AT inflammation, and glycemic dysregulation were not accompanied by significant increased levels of ET-1 in AT or circulation in wild-type mice; and that endothelial overexpression of ET-1 and consequent increased ET-1 levels did not cause AT inflammation yet impaired glucose tolerance; (ii) reduced AT inflammation and improved glucose tolerance with voluntary wheel running was not associated with decreased levels of ET-1 in AT or circulation in obese mice, nor did endothelial overexpression of ET-1 impede such exercise-induced metabolic adaptations; (iii) chronic pharmacological blockade of ET-1 receptors did not suppress AT inflammation in obese mice but improved glucose tolerance; and (iv) in a cohort of human subjects with a wide range of BMI, ET-1 levels in AT or circulation were not correlated with markers of inflammation in AT. In aggregate, we conclude that ET-1 signaling is not implicated in the development of visceral AT inflammation but promotes glucose intolerance, thus representing an important therapeutic target for glycemic dysregulation in conditions characterized by hyperendothelinemia. Furthermore, we show that the salutary effects of exercise on AT and systemic metabolic function are not contingent on the suppression of ET-1 signaling.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate changes in body tissue composition with obesity surgery regarding visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, and skeletal muscle.DESIGN: Prospective non-randomized single-center cohort study METHODS: Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measured volumes of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and skeletal muscle (SM) in 31 patients with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, 20) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, 11) preoperatively, at three- and 12-months follow-up.CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, there was higher net loss of SAT but higher relative loss of VAT with weight loss. SM was lost only during the first three months. MRI provides accurate evaluation of surgeries' effect on individual patients' tissue composition. This can benefit risk assessment for related cardiovascular and metabolic health but cost-related factors will likely reserve the used methods for research.

PURPOSE: This prospective clinical case series aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidal adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) implantation in patients with optic nerve diseases.METHODS: This prospective, single-center, phase 1/2 study enrolled 4 eyes of 4 patients with optic atrophy of various reasons who underwent suprachoroidal implantation of ADMSCs. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study was HM at 1 m. The worse eye of the patient was operated. Patients were evaluated on the first day, first week, first month, third and sixth months postoperatively. BCVA, anterior segment and fundus examination, color photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field examination were carried out at each visit. Fundus fluorescein angiography and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) recordings were performed at the end of the first, third and sixth months and anytime if necessary during the follow-up.RESULTS: All 4 patients completed the six-month follow-up. None of them had any systemic or ocular complications. All of the patients experienced visual acuity improvement, visual field improvement and improvement in the mfERG recordings. We found choroidal thickening in OCT of the 4 patients.CONCLUSION: Even though the sample size is small, the improvements were still encouraging. Stem cell treatment with suprachoroidal implantation of ADMSCs seems to be safe and effective in the treatment for optic nerve diseases that currently have no curative treatment options.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of chronic pain and disability. Regenerative therapies using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide an option for OA treatment as it could potentially regenerate the damaged cartilage. Bone marrow, adipose tissue and synovium are common MSC sources. The aim is to compare the therapeutic effect of MSCs from bone marrow, adipose tissue and synovium; combining its differentiation potential and accessibility, to decide the optimal source of MSCs for the treatment of knee OA. A comparison of preclinical and clinical studies using MSCs has been made with regard to treatment outcomes, isolation procedure and differentiation potential. All types of MSCs are effective at improving the clinical and structural condition of OA patients, but the longevity of the treatment, i.e. an effect that is maintained for at least 2 years, cannot be guaranteed. This review highlighted great variations in selection criteria and culture expansion conditions of MSCs between the literature and clinical trials. It also emphasised a substantial diversity and lack of consistency in the assessment mythology of clinical outcome after completion of MSC therapies procedures. A more cohesive methodology is required to evaluate the outcome of MSC treatments using quantitative and standardised frameworks in order to be able to directly compare results. Larger population of patients are recommended to assess the quality of MSC when designing studies and clinical trials to reaffirm the efficacy of MSC treatment prior to and within the clinical trials and follow up studies.

HYPOTHESIS: Circulating succinate and 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME) were recently shown to promote brown adipocyte thermogenesis and protect against metabolic disorders in rodents. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between plasma levels of these metabolites and adiposity and metabolic profile in humans.RESULTS: A one-SD higher plasma succinate and 12,13-diHOME concentration was associated with a 0.15 SD (95% CI 0.28, 0.03) and 0.08 SD (0.15, 0.01) lower total fat mass respectively. Additionally, a one-SD higher plasma 12,13-diHOME level was associated with a 0.09 SD (0.16, 0.02) lower fasting plasma insulin and 0.10 SD (0.17, 0.04) lower plasma triacylglycerol. In Mendelian randomisation analyses, genetically determined higher BMI, fasting hyperinsulinaemia and elevated lipid levels were not associated with changes in either plasma succinate or plasma 12,13-diHOME concentrations. No indications of bias due to directional pleiotropy were detected in the Mendelian randomisation analyses.INTERPRETATION: Our findings tentatively suggest that plasma succinate and 12,13-diHOME may play a role in the regulation of energy metabolism and brown adipose tissue activation in humans. Further studies encompassing direct assessment of brown adipose tissue activity and dietary supplementation are necessary to investigate the potential beneficial effects of these metabolites on systemic metabolism.

HYPOTHESIS: In the context of diabetes, the health benefit of antioxidant treatment has been widely debated. In this study, we investigated the effect of antioxidant treatment during the development of insulin resistance and hyperphagia in obesity and partial lipodystrophy.METHODS: We studied the role of antioxidants in the regulation of insulin resistance using the tamoxifen-inducible fat-specific insulin receptor knockout (iFIRKO) mouse model, which allowed us to analyse the antioxidant's effect in a time-resolved manner. In addition, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were used as a hyperphagic, chronically obese and diabetic mouse model to validate the beneficial effect of antioxidants on metabolism.RESULTS: Acute induction of insulin receptor knockout in adipocytes changed the substrate preference to fat before induction of a diabetic phenotype including hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia. In healthy chow-fed animals as well as in morbidly obese mice, this diabetic phase could be reversed within a few weeks. Furthermore, after the induction of insulin receptor knockout in mature adipocytes, iFIRKO mice were protected from subsequent obesity development through high-fat diet feeding. By genetic tracing we show that the persistent fat mass loss in mice after insulin receptor knockout in adipocytes is not caused by the depletion of adipocytes. Treatment of iFIRKO mice with antioxidants postponed and reduced hyperglycaemia by increasing insulin sensitivity. In ob/ob mice, antioxidants rescued both hyperglycaemia and hyperphagia.INTERPRETATION: We conclude that fat mass reduction through insulin resistance in adipocytes is not reversible. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that adipocytes undergo apoptosis during the process of extreme lipolysis, as a consequence of insulin resistance. Antioxidants have a beneficial health effect not only during the acute phase of diabetes development, but also in a temporary fashion once chronic obesity and diabetes have been established.

Dietary fatty acids (FAs) affect certain metabolic routes, including pathways controlled by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), but tissue-specific effects are not well-defined. Thus, the aim was to compare the metabolic response in hepatic, adipose, and cardiac tissues after treatment with specific PPAR agonists. Male Wistar rats were randomized into three groups: a control group receiving placebo (n=8); a PPAR<i>a</i> agonist group receiving WY-14,643 (n=6); and a PPAR<i><U+03B3></i> agonist group receiving rosiglitazone (n=6) for 12 days. All animals received a low-fat standard chow diet and were given a daily dose of placebo or agonist orally. Lipids and FA methyl esters were measured in plasma, liver, and heart and gene expression was measured in liver and adipose tissue, while enzyme activities were measured in liver. Treatment with the PPAR<i>a</i> agonist was associated with higher liver mass relative to body weight (liver index), lower plasma, and hepatic total cholesterol, as well as lower plasma carnitine and acylcarnitines, compared with control. In heart, PPAR<i>a</i> activation leads to overall lower levels of free FAs and specific changes in certain FAs, compared with control. Furthermore, <i>ß</i>-oxidation in liver and the enzymatic activities of well-known PPAR<i>a</i> targeted genes were higher following PPAR<i>a</i> administration. Overall, rats treated with the PPAR<i>a</i> agonist had higher hepatic saturated FAs (SFAs) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) and lower n-6 and n-3 PUFAs, compared to control. Treatment with the PPAR<i><U+03B3></i> agonist was associated with a lower liver index, lower plasma triglycerides (TAG) and phospholipids, and higher hepatic phospholipids, compared with control. PPAR<i><U+03B3></i> target genes were increased specifically in adipose tissue. Moreover, lower total cardiac FAs and SFA and higher cardiac n-6 PUFA were also associated with PPAR<i><U+03B3></i> activation. Altogether, there were characteristic effects of PPAR<i>a</i> activation in liver and heart, as well as in plasma. PPAR<i><U+03B3></i> effects were not only confined to adipose tissue, but specific effects were also seen in liver, heart, and plasma. In conclusion, short-term treatment with PPAR agonists induced tissue-specific effects on FA composition in liver and heart. Moreover, both PPAR<i>a</i> and PPAR<i><U+03B3></i> activation lowered plasma TAG and phospholipids, most likely through effects on liver and adipose tissue, respectively. In future studies we aim to reveal whether similar patterns can be found through diet-induced activation of specific pathways.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develops when the liver is unable to oxidize or export excess free fatty acids generated by adipose tissue lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis, or dietary intake. Although treatment has generally been centered on reversing metabolic risk factors that increase the likelihood of NAFLD by influencing lifestyle modifications, therapeutic modalities are being studied at the cellular and molecular level. The endocannabinoid system has been of recent focus. The agonism and antagonism of cannabinoid receptors play roles in biochemical mechanisms involved in the development or regression of NAFLD. Exocannabinoids and endocannabinoids, the ligands which bind cannabinoid receptors, have been studied in this regard. Exocannabinoids found in cannabis (marijuana) may have a therapeutic benefit. Our recent study demonstrated an inverse association between marijuana use and NAFLD among adults in the United States. This commentary combines knowledge on the role of the endocannabinoid system in the setting of NAFLD with the findings in our article to hypothesize different potential mechanisms that may influence the inverse relationship between cannabis and NAFLD.

Adipocytes have unique morphological traits in insulin sensitivity control. However, how the appearance of adipocytes can determine insulin sensitivity has not been understood. Here, we demonstrate that actin cytoskeleton reorganization upon lipid droplet (LD) configurations in adipocytes plays important roles in insulin-dependent glucose uptake by regulating GLUT4 trafficking. Compared to white adipocytes, brown/beige adipocytes with multilocular LDs exhibited well-developed filamentous (F)-actin structure and potentiated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of insulin. In contrast, LD enlargement and unilocularization in adipocytes downregulated cortical F-actin formation, eventually leading to decreased F-actin to globular (G)-actin ratio, and suppression of insulin-dependent GLUT4 trafficking. Pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization accompanied with impaired F/G-actin dynamics reduced glucose uptake in adipose tissue and conferred systemic insulin resistance in mice. Thus, our study reveals that adipocyte remodeling with different LD configurations could be an important factor to determine insulin sensitivity by modulating F/G-actin dynamics.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: CD68+ cells are a potent source of inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue and myocardium. The development of low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. The main aim of the study was to characterize and quantify myocardial and adipose tissue CD68+ cells and adipose tissue crown-like structures (CLS) in patients with obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD) and T2DM.CONCLUSIONS: Regional-based increases in the frequency of CD68+ cells and changes of their phenotype in CLS were detected in obese patients and CAD patients. Therapeutic modulation of adipose tissue inflammation may represent a target for treatment of obesity.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health priority, particularly for populations of black African-Caribbean ethnicity, who suffer disproportionately high rates of the disease. While the mechanisms underlying the development of T2D are well documented, there is growing evidence describing distinctions among black African-Caribbean populations. In the present paper, we review the evidence describing the impact of black African-Caribbean ethnicity on T2D pathophysiology. Ethnic differences were first recognised through evidence that metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria fail to detect T2D risk in black populations due to less central obesity and dyslipidaemia. Subsequently more detailed investigations have recognised other mechanistic differences, particularly lower visceral and hepatic fat accumulation and a distinctly hyperinsulinaemic response to glucose stimulation. While epidemiological studies have reported exaggerated insulin resistance in black populations, more detailed and direct measures of insulin sensitivity have provided evidence that insulin sensitivity is not markedly different to other ethnic groups and does not explain the hyperinsulinaemia that is exhibited. These findings lead us to hypothesise that ectopic fat does not play a pivotal role in driving insulin resistance in black populations. Furthermore, we hypothesise that hyperinsulinaemia is driven by lower rates of hepatic insulin clearance rather than heightened insulin resistance and is a primary defect rather than occurring in compensation for insulin resistance. These hypotheses are being investigated in our ongoing South London Diabetes and Ethnicity Phenotyping study, which will enable a more detailed understanding of ethnic distinctions in the pathophysiology of T2D between men of black African and white European ethnicity.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work was to determine the specific mechanisms by which resveratrol inhibits lipogenesis and stimulates lipolysis.METHODS: Twelve male mice were individually introduced into a metabolic cage for 24<U+2009>h to measure basal metabolic rate, prior to intervention. They were randomly divided into two groups, resveratrol (RSV) and control (C), and administered resveratrol intraperitoneally or vehicle, respectively, for two consecutive days. After 24<U+2009>h, the metabolic energy expenditure was again determined for 24<U+2009>h, before mice were sacrificed. Protein and gene expression of different enzymes related to metabolism in the hepatic tissue, adipose tissue and gastrocnemius of mice were analyzed by RT-PCR, western blot or ELISA.RESULTS: We report that resveratrol lowers the respiratory quotient in old mice and that this may be due to the activation of fatty acid mobilization from white adipose tissue (because hormone-activated lipase expression is increased) and fatty acid transport into mitochondria and eventual oxidation in muscle and liver (because transport enzymes and beta oxidation enzymes are also increased). Indeed, we have observed that resveratrol in vivo causes an increase in the expression and phosphorylation of AMPKa in liver, muscle and adipose tissue and an increase in the expression of acyl-CoA synthetase, of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 and of carnitine acylcarnitine translocase, all enzymes involved in lipid catabolism. On the other hand, the levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase as well as those its product, i.e. malonyl CoA, are decreased.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a controlled dose of resveratrol activates fatty acid mobilization and degradation and inhibits fatty acid synthesis in old mice. This is the first time that these effects of resveratrol in lipid metabolism in healthy old (non-obese) animals are reported.

Obesity and ancylostomiasis are considered public health problems. Recent studies have shown that infection by intestinal helminths in obese individuals can ameliorate metabolic disorder and improve glucose tolerance by decreasing both insulin resistance and low-intensity inflammation. However, few helminth species have been studied in this context, and some modulation mechanisms still require deeper investigation. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the role of experimental infection with Ancylostoma ceylanicum in the modulation of the immune response in an obese experimental model. Four groups of hamsters were used as follows: two groups were submitted to a hyperlipidic and hypercaloric diet capable of inducing obesity, one infected and the other uninfected; and two normonourished control groups, one infected and one uninfected by A. ceylanicum. Biochemical, haematological, parasitological and immunological parameters were evaluated. The results demonstrated that A. ceylanicum infection accentuated weight loss in obese animals compared to normonourished animals. However, obesity reduced the recovery of worms and oviposition of the females, and both infected groups showed decreased levels of haemoglobin, albumin, iron and erythrocytes. Significant relations were observed for pathogenesis in the following cases: infection interfered in lipid metabolism, which increased levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides in the obese group, and caused a decrease in HDL levels in both groups. Obesity led to an increase in glucose levels, and the infection exacerbated this parameter in both the normonourished and obese groups. Inflammation was intensified in obese animals that showed elevated macrophage and neutrophil activation in adipose tissue, enlargement of the spleen and accumulation of lipids in the liver and faeces. Despite the decrease in IFN-<U+03B3> levels, the infection did not potentiated the expression of the Foxp3, IL-10 and IL-2 transcription factor for any of the infected groups, markers that could positively compensate the host from the damage caused by obesity.

The present &quot;obesogenic' environment has favored excessive energy intake resulting in the current obesity epidemic and its associated diseases. The epidemic has incentivized scientists to develop novel behavioral and pharmacological strategies that enhance energy expenditure to compensate for excessive energy intake. Although physical activity is effective to increase total energy expenditure, it is insufficient to induce negative energy balance and weight loss. With the discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans, BAT activation soon emerged as a potential strategy for elevating energy expenditure. BAT is the only tissue that expresses uncoupling protein 1, conferring on this tissue high thermogenic capacity due to a low efficiency for mitochondrial ATP generation. Potential manipulation of BAT mass and activity has fueled the interest in altering whole-body energy balance through increased energy expenditure. Remarkable advances have been made in quantifying the amount and activity of BAT in humans. Many studies have concluded that the amount of active BAT appears insufficient to induce meaningful increases in energy expenditure. Thus, the majority of studies report that BAT activation does not influence body weight and metabolic control in humans. Strategies to increase BAT mass and/or to potentiate BAT activity seem necessary.

Leptin is an adipokine that regulates adipose tissue mass through membrane-anchored leptin receptor (Ob-R). Extracellular domain of Ob-R in plasma is called soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R), and is the main leptin-binding protein. Based on a previous DNA microarray analysis that showed induction of hepatic Ob-R mRNA in low-protein diet-fed mice, this study aimed to clarify the effect of dietary protein restriction on hepatic Ob-R mRNA and plasma sOb-R levels. First, the effect of protein restriction on hepatic Ob-R mRNA level was examined together with fasting and food restriction using male rats as common experimental model for nutritional research. Hepatic Ob-R mRNA level was increased by feeding low-protein diet for 7 d, although not significantly influenced by 12-h fasting and sixty percent restriction in food consumption. Then, effect of protein restriction on liver Ob-R and plasma sOb-R was investigated using male mice because specific sOb-R ELISA was more available for mice. Hepatic Ob-R mRNA level was also increased in protein restricted-mice although it did not increase in hypothalamus. Hepatic Ob-R protein was decreased, whereas plasma sOb-R was increased by protein restriction. Because the concentration of sOb-R increased without changing plasma leptin concentration, free leptin in plasma was significantly reduced. The direct effect of amino acid deprivation on Ob-R mRNA level was not observed in rat hepatoma cells H4IIE cultured in amino acid deprived medium. In conclusion, dietary protein restriction increased hepatic Ob-R mRNA, resulting in increased plasma sOb-R concentration, which in turn, reduces plasma free leptin level and may modulate leptin activity.

We report the case of a 23-year-old man presenting a right hypersecreting pheochromocytoma, falsely negative on F-FDG PET/CT and on I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (I-MIBG) scintigraphy but strongly positive on F-FDOPA PET/CT. Functional imaging has a key role in diagnosis and prognosis of pheochromocytomas, but choosing the most relevant modality remains difficult. Despite its high specificity, I-MIBG has a limited sensitivity. F-FDG can be used, but it is an unspecific tracer, and F-FDG uptake in brown adipose tissue can hinder the analysis. However, F-FDOPA shows very high sensitivity and specificity in pheochromocytomas with fewer drug interferences than I-MIBG.

Tissue-resident iNKT cells maintain tissue homeostasis and peripheral surveillance against pathogens; however, studying these cells is challenging due to their low abundance and poor recovery from tissues. We here show that iNKT transnuclear mice, generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer, have increased tissue resident iNKT cells. We examined expression of PLZF, T-bet, and ROR<U+03B3>t, as well as cytokine/chemokine profiles, and found that both monoclonal and polyclonal iNKT cells differentiated into functional subsets that faithfully replicated those seen in wild-type mice. We detected iNKT cells from tissues in which they are rare, including adipose, lung, skin-draining lymph nodes, and a previously undescribed population in Peyer's patches (PP). PP-NKT cells produce the majority of the IL-4 in Peyer's patches and provide indirect help for B-cell class switching to IgG1 in both transnuclear and wild-type mice. Oral vaccination with a-galactosylceramide shows enhanced fecal IgG1 titers in iNKT cell-sufficient mice. Transcriptional profiling reveals a unique signature of PP-NKT cells, characterized by tissue residency. We thus define PP-NKT as potentially important for surveillance for mucosal pathogens.

AIMS: We evaluated the relationship between epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and coronary vascular function assessed by rubidium-82 (82Rb) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included 270 patients with suspected CAD and normal myocardial perfusion at stress-rest 82Rb PET/CT. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and EAT volume were measured. Absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) was computed in mL/min/ from the dynamic rest and stress imaging. Myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was defined as the ratio of hyperaemic to baseline MBF and it was considered reduced when &lt;2. MPR was normal in 177 (65%) patients and reduced in 93 (35%). Patients with impaired MPR were older (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and had higher CAC score values (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.033), EAT thickness (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009), and EAT volume (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). At univariable logistic regression analysis, age, heart rate reserve (HRR), CAC score, EAT thickness, and EAT volume resulted significant predictors of reduced MPR, but only age (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002), HRR (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021), and EAT volume (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.043) were independently associated with reduced MPR, at multivariable analysis. In patients with CAC score 0 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>114), a significant relation between EAT volume and MPR (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.014) was observed, while the relationship was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.21) in patients with CAC score &gt;0 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>156).CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected CAD and normal myocardial perfusion, EAT volume predicts hyperaemic MBF and reduced MPR, confirming that visceral pericardium fat may influence coronary vascular function. Thus, EAT evaluation has a potential role in the early identification of coronary vascular dysfunction.

Clinical use of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine (OLA) is associated with metabolic side effects to variable degrees. N-desmethyl-olanzapine (DMO) is one major metabolite of OLA, but its potential involvement in the metabolic responses remains unclear. Here we examined whether DMO can directly impact the metabolic, endocrinal and inflammatory parameters under conditions of metabolic disturbance. DMO administration (2<U+202F>mg/kg, i.g.) to high-fat diet induced obesity mice for 4 weeks induced a remarkable loss of body weight and fat mass. DMO improved insulin resistance and energy expenditure in mice, but had no significant effects on dyslipidemia or hepatic steatosis. Moreover, DMO induced morphological changes in the white adipose tissue, accompanied by reduced interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) production and increased UCP1 expression. These findings demonstrate that DMO is devoid of the metabolic side effects commonly observed for OLA during obesity, which suggests that the N-desmethyl metabolism may function to regulate the metabolic responses to OLA.

Previously, we showed that loss of ovarian function in mice fed high-fat diet exacerbated insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation. In the current study, we tested whether consumption of luteolin, an anti-inflammatory flavonoid, could mitigate adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in obese ovariectomized mice. Nine-week-old ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 0.005% luteolin (HFD+L) for 16 weeks. Results showed no difference in body weight or fat mass between mice fed HFD+L and those fed HFD. However, luteolin supplementation resulted in lower CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages in gonadal adipose tissue, as well as a trend toward lower macrophage infiltration. Luteolin supplementation also significantly lowered mRNA expression of inflammatory and M1 markers MCP-1, CD11c, TNF-a and IL-6, while maintaining expression of M2 marker MGL1. Consistent with this, the in vitro luteolin treatment, with or without the presence of estrogen, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced polarization of RAW 264.7 cells toward M1 phenotype. We further found that luteolin supplementation protected mice from insulin resistance induced by HFD consumption; this improved insulin resistance was correlated with reductions in CD11c<sup>+</sup> adipose tissue macrophages. Taken together, these findings indicate that dietary luteolin supplementation attenuates adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance found in mice with loss of ovarian function coupled with an HFD intake, and this effect may be partly mediated through suppressing M1-like polarization of macrophages in adipose tissue. These results have clinical implication in implementing dietary intervention for prevention of metabolic syndrome associated with postmenopause and obesity.

OBJECTIVE: Mineralocorticoid receptor activation of the epithelial sodium channel in endothelial cells (ECs) (EnNaC) is accompanied by aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated arterial relaxation. Recent data support enhanced activity of the alpha subunit of EnNaC (aEnNaC) mediates this aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and associated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation. There is mounting evidence that diet induced obesity diminishes expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase a (AMPKa), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which would be expected to lead to impaired downstream eNOS activation. Thereby, we posited that enhanced EnNaC activation contributes to diet induced obesity related increases in stiffness of the endothelium and diminished NO mediated vascular relaxation by increasing oxidative stress and related inhibition of AMPKa, Sirt1, and associated eNOS inactivation.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that endothelial specific EnNaC activation mediates WD-induced endothelial stiffness, impaired eNOS activation, aortic fibrosis and remodeling through increased aortic oxidative stress and increased inflammation related to a reduction of AMPKa and Sirt 1 mediated eNOS phosphorylation/activation and NO production.

OBJECTIVE: Elimination of food calories as heat could help redress the excess accumulation of metabolic energy exhibited as obesity. Prior studies have focused on the induction of thermogenesis in beige and brown adipose tissues as the application of this principle, particularly because the ß-adrenergic environment associated with thermogenic activation has been shown to have positive health implications. The counterpoint to this strategy is the regulation of heat loss; we propose that mammals with inefficient heat conservation will require more thermogenesis to maintain body temperature.METHODS: Surface temperature thermography and rates of trans-epidermal water loss were integrated to profile the total heat transfer of genetically-engineered and genetically variable mice.RESULTS: These data were incorporated with energy expenditure data to generate a biophysical profile to test the significance of increased rates of evaporative cooling.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of daily calorie restriction (DR) versus intermittent fasting (IF) on markers of inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in a controlled feeding trial in women with overweight or obesity.METHODS: Women (N<U+202F>=<U+202F>76) were randomised to one of three diets and provided with all foods at 100% (IF100) or 70% (IF70 and DR70) of calculated energy requirements for 8<U+202F>weeks. IF groups ate breakfast prior to fasting for 24-h on 3 non-consecutive days/week. Weight, body composition, serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), M1- and M2-macrophage markers by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were measured following a 12-h overnight fast (fed day, all groups) and a 24-h fast (IF groups only).CONCLUSIONS: Unlike caloric restriction, IF transiently elevated markers of macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, possibly in response to marked increases in adipose tissue lipolysis.

Findings from epidemiological studies over the past 30 years have shown that visceral adipose tissue, accurately measured by CT or MRI, is an independent risk marker of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence also suggests that ectopic fat deposition, including hepatic and epicardial fat, might contribute to increased atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic risk. This joint position statement from the International Atherosclerosis Society and the International Chair on Cardiometabolic Risk Working Group on Visceral Obesity summarises the evidence for visceral adiposity and ectopic fat as emerging risk factors for type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease, with a focus on practical recommendations for health professionals and future directions for research and clinical practice. We discuss the measurement of visceral and ectopic fat, pathophysiology and contribution to adverse health outcomes, response to treatment, and lessons from a public health programme targeting visceral and ectopic fat. We identify knowledge gaps and note the need to develop simple, clinically applicable tools to be able to monitor changes in visceral and ectopic fat over time. Finally, we recognise the need for public health messaging to focus on visceral and ectopic fat in addition to excess bodyweight to better combat the growing epidemic of obesity worldwide.

The physiological control of lactation through coordinated adaptations is of fundamental importance for mammalian neonatal life. The putative actions of reduced insulin sensitivity and responsiveness and enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis spare glucose for the mammary synthesis of milk. However, severe insulin antagonism and body fat mobilization may jeopardize hepatic health and lactation in dairy cattle. Interestingly, lipolysis- and dietary-derived fatty acids may impair insulin sensitivity in cows. The mechanisms are undefined yet have major implications for the development of postpartum fatty liver disease. In nonruminants, the sphingolipid ceramide is a potent mediator of saturated fat-induced insulin resistance that defines in part the mechanisms of type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In ruminants including the lactating dairy cow, the functions of ceramide had remained virtually undescribed. Through a series of hypothesis-centered studies, ceramide has emerged as a potential antagonist of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues in dairy cattle. Importantly, bovine data suggest that the ability of ceramide to inhibit insulin action likely depends on the lipolysis-dependent hepatic synthesis and secretion of ceramide during early lactation. Although these mechanisms appear to fade as lactation advances beyond peak milk production, early evidence suggests that palmitic acid feeding is a means to augment ceramide supply. Herein, we review a body of work that focuses on sphingolipid biology and the role of ceramide in the dairy cow within the framework of hepatic and fatty acid metabolism, insulin function, and lactation. The potential involvement of ceramide within the endocrine control of lactation is also considered.

BACKGROUND: The discovery of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) has prompted an increase in research aimed at understanding their biological roles including regulation of appetite and energy metabolism. However, a knowledge gap remains to understand the effect of dietary components on NAE levels, in particular, heterogeneity in dietary fatty acid (DFA) profile, on NAE levels across various organs.OBJECTIVE: To identify and elucidate the impact of diet on NAE levels in seven different tissues/organs of male hamsters, with the hypothesis that DFA will act as precursors for NAE synthesis in golden Syrian male hamsters.METHOD: A two-month feeding trial was performed, wherein hamsters were fed various dietary oil blends with different composition of 18-C fatty acid (FA).RESULTS: DFA directly influences tissue FA and NAE levels. After C18:1n9-enriched dietary treatments, marked increases were observed in duodenal C18:1n9 and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) concentrations. Among all tissues; adipose tissue brown, adipose tissue white, brain, heart, intestine-duodenum, intestine-jejunum, and liver, a negative correlation was observed between gut-brain OEA concentrations and body weight.CONCLUSION: DFA composition influences FA and NAE levels across all tissues, leading to significant shifts in intestinal-brain OEA concentrations. The endogenously synthesized increased OEA levels in these tissues enable the gut-brain-interrelationship. Henceforth, we summarize that the brain transmits anorexic properties mediated via neuronal signalling, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy body weight. Thus, the benefits of OEA can be enhanced by the inclusion of C18:1n9-enriched diets, pointing to the possible nutritional use of this naturally occurring bioactive lipid-amide in the management of obesity.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The pathogenesis of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. We undertook this study to elucidate the interplay between macrophage activation, insulin resistance (IR) in target organs/tissues and hepatic damage.METHODS: In 40 non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD we assessed 1) Endogenous Glucose Production (EGP), Glucose Clearance and indexes of IR in the adipose tissue (Adipo-IR and Lipo-IR) and in the liver (Hep-IR) by tracers infusion ([6,6-2H2]glucose and [2H5]glycerol); 2) macrophage activity (by soluble sCD163) and 3) hepatic expression of CD163 (hCD163).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may suggest a link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, possibly in response to FFA overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes. Conversely, our findings do not support a link between activated hepatic macrophages and glucose metabolism (EGP or Hep-IR). The relationship between adipose tissue IR and hepatic macrophages should be considered in defining therapeutic targets for NAFLD. Lay summary The pathogenesis of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in insulin resistant state. This study providesin vivosupport of a possible link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, most likely in response to FFA overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes.

Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is a member of secreted protein family with sequence similarity to frizzled receptors of wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling pathways. These proteins control diverse functions from embryonic development to adults in many organisms including humans. Initially, SFRPs were recognized as antagonists of Wnt signaling and supposed to interact with Wnts. Further research demonstrated their interactions to frizzled receptors and a functional diversity was related to these proteins, Wnt signaling potentiation in addition to modulation. SFRP4 is the largest member of SFRP family and is implicated in many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cancer. SFRP4 acts as a biomarker for T2D and was expressed several years before clinical diagnosis of disease. This review mainly focusses on the role of SFRP4 in obesity and how it can lead to ß-cell failure and ultimately to T2D. The role of SFRP4 in adipose tissues causing increased production of adipokines lead to the oxidative stress in pancreas that particularly have low amount of antioxidant enzymes in pancreatic ß-cells leading to failure in exocytosis of insulin containing granules causing T2D. Obesity-induced inflammation is a principal factor in pathogenesis of insulin resistance as well as metabolic syndrome. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have potential to cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscles, adipose tissue, and liver via inhibition of insulin signal transduction. Secretion of SFRP4 is mediated by interleukin 1-ß (IL1-ß). This review highlights the molecular mechanisms by which SFRP4 leads to T2D. Understanding of molecular mechanism and targeting SFRP4 could help to eradicate or reduce chances of developing T2D.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the associations of positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance (MR), and infrared thermography (IRT) imaging modalities with energy expenditure (EE) after brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation using capsinoid ingestion and cold exposure.METHODS: Twenty participants underwent PET-MR, IRT imaging, and whole-body calorimetry after capsinoid ingestion and cold exposure. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and the fat fraction (FF) of the supraclavicular brown adipose tissue regions were estimated. The anterior supraclavicular temperature (Tscv) from IRT at baseline and postintervention was measured. Two-hour post-capsinoid ingestion EE and post-cold exposure EE served as a reference to correlate fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, FF, and Tscv for BAT assessment. IRT images were geometrically transformed to overlay on PET-MR for visualization of the hottest regions.RESULTS: The supraclavicular hot spot identified on IRT closely corresponded to the area of maximal fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET images. Controlling for body weight, post-cold exposure Tscv was a significant variable associated with EE (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025). The SUV was significantly inversely correlated with FF (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.012) and significantly correlated with peak of Tscv during cold exposure in BAT-positive participants (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.022).CONCLUSIONS: Tscv correlated positively with EE and was also significantly correlated with SUV after cold exposure. Both IRT and MR FF are promising methods to study BAT activity noninvasively.

Deteriorating weight loss in patients with Huntington's disease (HD) is a complicated peripheral manifestation and the cause remains poorly understood. Studies suggest that body weight strongly influences the clinical progression rate of HD and thereby offers a valuable target for therapeutic interventions. Mutant huntingtin (mHTT) is ubiquitously expressed and could induce toxicity by directly acting in the peripheral tissues. We investigated the effects of selective expression of mHTT exon1 in fat body (FB; functionally equivalent to human adipose tissue and liver) using transgenic Drosophila. We find that FB-autonomous expression of mHTT exon1 is intrinsically toxic and causes chronic weight loss in the flies despite progressive hyperphagia, and early adult death. Moreover, flies exhibit loss of intracellular lipid stores, and decline in the systemic levels of lipids and carbohydrates which aggravates over time, representing metabolic defects. At the cellular level, besides impairment, cell death also occurs with the formation of mHTT aggregates in the FB. These findings indicate that FB-autonomous expression of mHTT alone is sufficient to cause metabolic abnormalities and emaciation in vivo without any neurodegenerative cues.

Exposure to maternal obesity during early development programmes adverse metabolic health in rodent offspring. We assessed the relative contributions of obesity during pregnancy and suckling on metabolic health post-weaning. Wistar rat offspring exposed to control (C) or cafeteria diet (O) during pregnancy were cross-fostered to dams on the same (CC, OO) or alternate diet during suckling (CO, OC) and weaned onto standard chow. Measures of offspring metabolic health included growth, adipose tissue mass, and 12-week glucose and insulin concentrations during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT). Exposure to maternal obesity during lactation was a driver for reduced offspring weight post-weaning, higher fasting blood glucose concentrations and greater gonadal adiposity (in females). Males displayed insulin resistance, through slower glucose clearance despite normal circulating insulin and lower mRNA expression of PIK3R1 and PIK3CB in gonadal fat and liver respectively. In contrast, maternal obesity during pregnancy up-regulated the insulin signalling genes IRS2, PIK3CB and SREBP1-c in skeletal muscle and perirenal fat, favouring insulin sensitivity. In conclusion exposure to maternal obesity during lactation programmes offspring adiposity and insulin resistance, overriding exposure to an optimal nutritional environment in utero, which cannot be alleviated by a nutritionally balanced post-weaning diet.

BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue defects leading to severe functional (disability) and morphological (disfigurement) morbidity are often treated in plastic surgery with fat grafting, which can be limited by resorption, necrosis, and cyst formation. Our study aimed to assess whether adipose scaffolds could provide an environment for in situ autologous fat grafting, and to study whether adipose cell migration and proliferation (adipogenesis) within scaffolds could be enhanced by preliminarily increasing the vascularity (preconditioning) of the surrounding tissues recipient of the scaffolds.METHODS: Using an established rodent model of subcutaneous tissue/scaffold grafting, we tested the potential of a human-derived, shelf-ready, injectable, decellularized allograft adipose matrix (AAM) to reconstruct soft tissue defects when used in combination with non-invasive mechanical (suction-induced) skin preconditioning.RESULTS: Combined use of the AAM and non-invasive skin preconditioning significantly improved long-term volume retention (50-80% higher at a 12-week follow-up) and histological quality of reconstructed tissues compared to standard of care (autologous adipose grafts). The components of the AAM supported adipogenesis and angiogenesis. Combining the AAM to living adipose grafts mitigated negative outcomes (lower long-term volume retention, higher presence of cystic-like areas).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the synergistic use of the AAM and non-invasive tissue preconditioning provides an effective solution to improve fat grafting. These strategies can easily be tested in clinical trials and could establish the basis for a novel therapeutic paradigm in reconstructive surgery.

Energy balance is essential for all species. Ligand-receptor interactions mediate processes that regulate body activities like reproduction and metabolism based on the energy status. Such receptors are the heparan sulfate proteoglycans and specifically the family of syndecans. Therefore we investigated the differences of metabolic parameters of heterozygous Syndecan 1 mice (Sdc1+/-) with reduced expression of Sdc1 and the corresponding wild type mice. Sdc1+/- mice have a reduced body weight although they show increased leptin and decreased corticosterone levels. Furthermore, their food and water intake is increased. This is accompanied with less adipose tissue, smaller adipocytes and thus an increased density of adipocytes. For the detailed analysis of the metabolism the automated PhenoMaster system has been used, which allowed continuous and undisturbed recording of food and water intake, energy expenditure and movement. The reason for the lower body weight was the higher energy expenditure of these animals compared to controls. Additionally, female Sdc1+/- mice showed an increased locomotor activity. Referring to organs, the intestine in Sdc1+/- mice was heavier and longer, but no differences at the cellular level could be observed. These findings were independent of normal mating or vice versa embryo transfers of Sdc1+/- and wild type embryos in recipient females of the other genotype. Herein we showed that the reduced expression of Sdc1 led to an altered metabolism on fetal as well as on maternal side, which may play a role in the growth restriction observed in human pregnancy pathologies and in mice lacking Sdc1.

CONTEXT: Oxidative stress and insulin resistance are often present in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).OBJECTIVE: We determined the effect of saturated fat ingestion on leukocytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and p47phox expression, and circulating thiobarituric substances (TBARS) in women with PCOS.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Academic medical center.PATIENTS: Twenty reproductive-age women with PCOS (10 lean, 10 obese) and 19 ovulatory controls (10 lean, 9 obese).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ROS generation and p47phox mRNA and protein content were quantified in leukocytes, and TBARS was measured in plasma from blood drawn fasting and 2, 3 and 5 hours after saturated fat ingestion. Insulin sensitivity was derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (ISOGTT). Androgen secretion was assessed from blood drawn fasting and 24, 48 and 72 hours after HCG administration.RESULTS: Lean and obese women with PCOS exhibited lipid-induced increases in leukocytic ROS generation and p47phox mRNA and protein content as well as plasma TBARS compared with lean control subjects. Both PCOS groups exhibited lower ISOGTT and greater HCG-stimulated androgen secretion compared with control subjects. The ROS generation, p47phox and TBARS responses were negatively correlated with ISOGTT, and positively correlated with HCG-stimulated androgen secretion.CONCLUSION: In PCOS, increases in ROS generation, p47phox gene expression and circulating TBARS in response to saturated fat ingestion are independent of obesity. Circulating MNC and excess adipose tissue are separate and distinct contributors to oxidative stress in this disorder.

SCOPE: To identify the age-dependent effect of diets containing elevated amounts of either saturated or unsaturated fatty acids on cardiac steatosis in mice.METHODS AND RESULTS: Five- and eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice cohorts are given free access to either a saturated or an unsaturated fatty-acid-enriched diet during 8 weeks. Body weight (BW) and food intake are monitored during this period. Cardiac lipid content, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) activity, and the amount of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3) are analyzed and correlated with blood leptin concentration. Leptin and PPAR<U+03B3> gene expression is quantified in white adipose tissue (WAT). Both diets have a similar effect on food intake, BW, and adiposity, independently of the age. Nevertheless, cardiac steatosis is specifically identified in adolescent mice consuming the saturated diet. These animals also display lower activity of cardiac CPT-I, a down-regulation of cardiac UCP2, together with lower concentration of plasma leptin. Accordingly, leptin gene expression is reduced in the visceral WAT.CONCLUSION: Consumption of diets containing elevated amounts of saturated fat during adolescence and early adult life promotes cardiac steatosis in mice. An insufficient endocrine activity of WAT, in terms of leptin production, may account for such an effect.

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is now a well-known factor which initiates many metabolic derangements in various tissues and organs including liver, muscle, pancreas, adipose tissue, cardiovascular and nervous system. Cardiovascular complications are most important, and they are so intensively affected that their derangement leads to cardiac failure even in the absence of ischemic heart diseases. This entity of cardiac pathology in DM is often regarded as diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recently many plant derived drugs have been tested to control and alleviate DCM. Wogonin is one of the drugs whose characteristics has intensely been studied. Wogonin is a flavonoid which means they have yellow color pigment in their leaves and is obtained from the roots of plant Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi. Wogonin has long been used as an active anti-cancer drug in Chinese medicine practice. In recent past wogonin has shown to possess notable anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic properties also. Wogonin has demonstrated to possess anti-oxidant, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and also anti-thrombotic properties. Wogonin has shown to alleviate apoptosis, and ER stress in the cells and this property can also be used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Notably, Wogonin has been documented to have an extensive margin of safety as well as displays little or no organ toxicity following extended intravenous administration. In this review we have discussed recently discovered therapeutic potential of wogonin in the treatment of DCM.

Adipose tissue development is regulated by a serial of developmental signaling pathways. The Hippo pathway is a novel signaling cascade closely associated with adipogenesis. While most of Hippo pathway components had been verified that have a vital role in preadipocytes proliferation and differentiation, little is known about the function of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in mammalian adipose tissue development. Therefore, we investigated the role of YAP1 in ovine adipose tissue development by in vitro and in vivo experiments. We observed that the adipocyte size in subcutaneous adipose tissue increased with development. YAP1 expression increased during adipose tissue development, while decreased during the differentiation of ovine preadipocytes in vitro. YAP1 knockdown notably promoted lipid accumulation and suppressed ovine preadipocyte proliferation. In addition, we observed that YAP1 deficiency significantly upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) expression. By contrast, overexpression of YAP1 led to the suppression of preadipocyte differentiation, lipid droplets formation, and PPARG expression. In brief, our findings demonstrated that YAP1 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of ovine preadipocyte via altering PPARG and RXR alpha expression.

KEY POINTS: Mice are commonly housed at room temperatures below their thermoneutral zone meaning they are exposed to chronic thermal stress. Endurance exercise induces browning and mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipose tissue of rodents, but there are conflicting reports of this phenomenon in humans. We hypothesized that the ambient room temperature at which mice are housed could partially explain these discrepant reports between humans and rodents. We housed mice at room temperature or thermoneutrality and studied their physiological responses to acute and chronic exercise. We found that thermoneutral housing altered running behaviour and glucose homeostasis, and further, that exercise-induced markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and the browning of white adipose tissue were reduced in mice housed at thermoneutrality.ABSTRACT: Mice are often housed at temperatures below their thermoneutral zone resulting in compensatory increases in thermogenesis. Despite this, many studies report housing mice at room temperature (RT), likely for the convenience of the researchers studying them. As such, the conflicting reports between humans and rodents regarding the ability of exercise to increase mitochondrial and thermogenic markers in white adipose tissue may be explained by the often-overlooked variable, housing temperature. To test this hypothesis, we housed male C57BL/6 mice at RT (22°C) or thermoneutrality (TN) (29°C) with or without access to a voluntary running wheel for 6 weeks or subjected them to an acute exhaustive bout of treadmill running. We examined the gene expression and protein content of select mitochondrial and thermogenic markers in skeletal muscle, epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). We also assessed adipocyte morphology and indices of glucose homeostasis. Housing temperature influenced glucose tolerance and insulin action in vivo, yet the beneficial effects of exercise, both acute and chronic, remained intact in eWAT, BAT and skeletal muscle irrespective of housing temperature. Housing mice at TN led to an attenuation of some of the effects of exercise on iWAT. Collectively, we present data characterizing the acute and chronic metabolic adaptations to exercise at different housing temperatures and demonstrate, for the first time, that temperature influences the ability of exercise to increase markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and the browning of white adipose tissue.

BACKGROUND: Scarring is a distressing outcome of acne, as it causes cosmetic and psychological problems to the patients. Unfortunately no single treatment is satisfactory; instead, employing multiple modalities may have better outcome. Autologous adipose tissue-derived adult stem cells (AT-ASCs) and their secretory factors can stimulate collagen synthesis; angiogenesis and migration of fibroblasts thus regenerate damaged tissues. Also, conventional treatments for acne scarring, such as lasers and topical regimens, induce new collagen synthesis via activation of dermal fibroblasts or growth factors. The aim of the study was to verify the effectiveness of AT-ASCs for the treatment of acne scarring vs. the fractional carbon dioxide laser (FxCR).SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Split face comparative study included 10 adult patients with post-acne scars on both sides of the face. One side received AT-ASCs single injection while the other received three sessions of FxCR. Scars were then assessed using the global scoring system Goodman and Baron, scar area percent using NIH ImageJ software and functional assessment by measuring the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin hydration. Both sides were followed for three months.RESULTS: A significant improvement in the degree of scar severity, scar area percent, skin hydration, and TEWL after 3 months of treatment on both sides of the face with insignificant differences between both treatment modalities, provided that AT-ASCs treatment was employed once vs. three sessions of FxCR.CONCLUSION: One injection of AT-ASCs is as effective as three sessions of FxCR in the treatment of atrophic acne scars.

There is a dual relationship between bone and tissues involved in energy metabolism (fat tissue and beta-pancreatic cells). Thus, bone remodeling is an energy consuming process, but osteocalcin, the main on-collagenic protein, synthesized by osteoblas during bone formation exerts a number of biological effects on beta-pancreatic and adipose cells. With this data, we wanted to see if the presence of a chronic metabolic disorder such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influence this complex dual relationship. For this, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the relation between osteocalcin and energetic metabolism in a group of 146 postmenopausal womens with and without T2DM at CI Parhon National Institute of Endocrinology, Bucharest. Clinical, metabolic and hormonal parameters were evaluated. For statistical analysis we used Student t-test and the Spearman correlation (statistical significance: p &lt;0.05). Results: 63 patients with T2DM (63.88±8.56 years) and 83 women in the control group (60.21±8.77 years) were included. Diabetic women showed a lower level of serum total osteocalcin (p&lt;0.05) HDL-cholesterol (p=0.02), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). The body mass index (BMI), glycemic metabolism parameters and triglyceride levels (p&lt;0.05) were higher in this group. We found correlations between osteocalcin and metabolic elements: negative with BMI (r=-0.329, p&lt;0.05), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (r=-0.398, p&lt;0.05), and serum triglycerides (r=-0.329, p&lt;0.05) respectively positive with HDL-cholesterol (r=0.279, p=0.001) for the entire group of patients. Conclusions: Our study indicated the presence of significant correlations between serum osteocalcin and glycemic and lipid metabolism parameters, independent of the presence of diabetes.

In addition to their role in glucose and lipid metabolism, adipocytes respond differentially to physiological cues or metabolic stress by releasing endocrine factors that regulate diverse processes, such as energy expenditure, appetite control, glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, inflammation and tissue repair. Both energy-storing white adipocytes and thermogenic brown and beige adipocytes secrete hormones, which can be peptides (adipokines), lipids (lipokines) and exosomal microRNAs. Some of these factors have defined targets; for example, adiponectin and leptin signal through their respective receptors that are expressed in multiple organs. For other adipocyte hormones, receptors are more promiscuous or remain to be identified. Furthermore, many of these hormones are also produced by other organs and tissues, which makes defining the endocrine contribution of adipose tissues a challenge. In this Review, we discuss the functional role of adipose tissue-derived endocrine hormones for metabolic adaptations to the environment and we highlight how these factors contribute to the development of cardiometabolic diseases. We also cover how this knowledge can be translated into human therapies. In addition, we discuss recent findings that emphasize the endocrine role of white versus thermogenic adipocytes in conditions of health and disease.

Age-specific differences in the pharmacokinetics of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and its metabolite 3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene (3-OHBaP) potentially affect time courses of tissue concentration; however, the quantitative impact of these differences is not well characterized. Our objective was to quantify the effect of age-specific differences in physiological and biochemical parameters on the pharmacokinetics of BaP and 3-OHBaP from newborn at birth to adulthood following inhalation exposure. The time courses of BaP and 3-OHBaP were simulated by using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model with Advanced Continuous Simulation Language (ACSLX). The concentrations of BaP increased with age in the liver but decreased with age in most tissues, urine, and blood. The concentrations of 3-OHBaP were the highest in the newborns. Our results also showed that the concentration of BaP has almost reached a steady state in the kidney, liver, lung, rapidly perfused tissues, slowly perfused tissues, and skin except for adipose tissues. However, the concentration of 3-OHBaP has reached a steady state in all tissues. This study suggests that age-specific parameters have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of BaP and 3-OHBaP. In particular, tissue concentration in the newborns is higher than other age groups, which indicates that the newborns are susceptible to environmental BaP exposure.

Metabolic characterization of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) is of importance in stem cell research. The monitoring of the cell status often requires cell destruction. An analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the headspace above cell cultures might be a noninvasive and nondestructive alternative to in vitro analysis. Furthermore, VOC analyses permit new insight into cellular metabolism due to their view on volatile compounds. Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare VOC profiles in the headspace above nondifferentiating and adipogenically differentiating ASCs. To this end, ASCs were cultivated under nondifferentiating and adipogenically differentiating conditions for up to 21 days. At different time points the headspace samples were preconcentrated by needle trap micro extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Adipogenic differentiation was assessed at equivalent time points. Altogether the emissions of 11 VOCs showed relevant changes and were analyzed in more detail. A few of these VOCs, among them acetaldehyde, were significantly different in the headspace of adipogenically differentiating ASCs and appeared to be linked to metabolic processes. Furthermore, our data indicate that VOC headspace analysis might be a suitable, noninvasive tool for the metabolic monitoring of (mesenchymal stem) cells in vitro.

OBJECTIVE: we assessed the relationship between serum and human foremilk and hindmilk concentrations of ghrelin and leptin in nursing mothers according to the type of feeding.METHODS: this cohort design was carried out on 131 mother-newborn dyads admitted to a physiological puerperium ward. The independent variables were the type of feeding, full breastfeeding (FBF, 56.5%) and partial breastfeeding (PBF, 43.5%). The dependent variables were the concentration of total ghrelin (pg/ml) and leptin (ng/ml) in serum, foremilk and hindmilk at eight and 16 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained from the nursing mothers at four months for serum assays. Unpaired Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's correlation tests, coefficient of determination and linear regression were used.RESULTS: the concentration of ghrelin and leptin in hindmilk was higher than that of foremilk in both groups at eight and 16 weeks. The concentration of ghrelin and leptin was higher in serum than in foremilk in both groups. These values showed a direct and significant linear correlation with the exception of ghrelin in the FBF group. The serum concentration of leptin in mothers explained 32% of the variance of its concentration in foremilk in the FBF and 13% in the PBF groups.CONCLUSION: the hindmilk/foremilk gradient suggests an intake regulating mechanism during the fed. The concentration of ghrelin and leptin was higher in the serum than in foremilk and its correlation and determination coefficients could suggest plasma-milk transfer in addition to synthesis regulation by the mammary gland, adipose tissue or other organs.

Catecholamine effects via ß3-adrenergic receptors are important for the metabolism of the adipose tissue. Physical exercise is a core component of antiobesity regimens. We have tested the hypothesis that voluntary wheel running results in enhancement of ß3-adrenergic receptor gene expression in the white and brown adipose tissues. The secondary hypothesis is that dietary tryptophan depletion modifies metabolic effects of exercise. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned for sedentary and exercise groups with free access to running wheels for 3 weeks. All animals received normal control diet for 7 days. Both groups were fed either by low tryptophan (0.04%) diet or by control diet (0.2%) for next 2 weeks. The ß3-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels in response to running increased in the retroperitoneal and epididymal fat pads. The gene expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) was increased in the brown, while unchanged in the white fat tissues. Unlike control animals, the rats fed by low tryptophan diet did not exhibit a reduction of the white adipose tissue mass. Tryptophan depletion resulted in enhanced concentrations of plasma aldosterone and corticosterone, but had no influence on exercise-induced adrenal hypertrophy. No changes in ß3-adrenergic receptor and cell proliferation measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation in left heart ventricle were observed. The reduced ß3-adrenergic receptor but not enhanced uncoupling protein-1 gene expression supports the hypothesis on hypoactive brown adipose tissue during exercise. Reduction in dietary tryptophan had no major influence on the exercise-induced changes in the metabolic parameters measured.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), but the association between fat distribution, i.e., visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and coronary artery plaque morphology remains unclear. This study explored the association between abdominal fat distribution and coronary artery plaques.METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 4327 consecutive patients without CAD history, undergoing coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography. Plaques were assessed using segment stenosis score (SSS) and segment involvement score (SIS). We evaluated abdominal VAT and SAT areas using CT images. Patients were categorized into four groups: low VAT (&lt;median)/low SAT (&lt;median); low VAT/high SAT (=median); high VAT (=median)/low SAT; and high VAT/high SAT.RESULTS: Mean age was 65 years (men, 66.4%). VAT area correlated with SSS (ß-coefficient<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.11, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001) and SIS (ß-coefficient<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.006, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001), whereas SAT area was inversely correlated with SSS (ß-coefficient<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.007,p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001) and SIS (ß-coefficient<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.004, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001). The low VAT/high SAT group had the lowest risk of higher SSS (=5) and SIS (=5) (odds ratio [OR] using low VAT/low SAT group as the reference category, 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.95, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05; OR, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.53-0.88, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.01, respectively) in multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and traditional CAD risk factors. In the obese population (body mass index =25, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>1694), the low VAT/high SAT group had the lowest risk of higher coronary plaque scores.CONCLUSIONS: Higher SAT and lower VAT were inversely correlated with the extent and severity of coronary artery plaques. Fat distribution may be useful for evaluating risk and prognosis of CAD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce obesity, female CD-1 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 14<U+202F>weeks. The test compound at the doses of 10 or 15<U+202F>mg/kg, i.p. was administrated for 21<U+202F>days. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests was performed at the beginning of week 15. At the end of study, amount of intraperitoneal fat pads, AlAT, IL-6 and TNF-a plasma levels were determined.RESULTS: Animals fed with high-fat diet and treated with test compound at the dose of 15<U+202F>mg/kg showed significantly less weight gain, than mice from the control group. The use of KSK19 for 21<U+202F>days in obese mice also significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. In the tested doses KSK19 did not affect locomotor activity neither in lean nor in obese mice after single i.p. administration, but spontaneous activity increased during three hour after twentieth administrations.

Butyrate, a key metabolite fermented by gut microbiota mainly from undigested carbohydrates such as dietary fibers is widely used as feed additive. However, mechanisms of its contributions in maintaining host health are relatively poorly revealed. The aim of this study was to investigate how butyrate impacts gut microbiota and immunity response in high-fat diet-fed mice. Gut microbial analysis exhibited that butyrate intervention increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria and decreased pathogenic bacteria, such as endotoxin-secreting bacteria. Our result also demonstrated that butyrate intervention enhanced fecal SCFAs concentrations, and inhibited endotoxin levels in feces and serum. Correlation analysis indicated positive relation between endotoxin level and Desulfovibrionaceae abundance. Furthermore, butyrate intervention inhibited expressions of IL-1ß, IL-6 and MCP1/CCL2 in liver, as well as TLR4 in adipose tissue. Apart from inhibiting expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, butyrate exerted anti-inflammation effect through selectively modulating gut microbiota, such as increasing SCFAs-producing bacteria and decreasing endotoxin-secreting bacteria, as well as via regulating levels of microbiota-dependent metabolites and components, such as SCFAs and endotoxin.

Aims Heart failure (HF) is associated with increased large conduit artery stiffness and afterload resulting in stiffening of the coronary arteries. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) both promote arterial stiffness, yet the mechanisms by which coronary PVAT promotes arterial stiffness and the efficacy of exercise to prevent coronary stiffness are unknown. We hypothesized both chronic continuous and interval exercise training would prevent coronary PVAT-mediated AGE secretion and arterial stiffness. Methods and Results Yucatan mininature swine were divided into four groups: control-sedentary (CON), aortic-banded sedentary heart failure (HF), aortic-banded HF continuous exercise trained (HF+CONT), and aortic-banded HF interval exercise trained (HF+IT). The left circumflex (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA) underwent ex vivo mechanical testing, and arterial AGE, elastin and collagen were assessed. Coronary elastin elastic modulus (EEM) and elastin protein were lower, and AGE was increased with HF compared to CON that was prevented by both HF+CONT and HF+IT. Mouse aortic segments treated with swine coronary PVAT-conditioned media had lower EEM, elastin content, greater AGE secretion and arterial AGE accumulation in HF compared with CON, which was prevented by both HF+CONT and HF+IT. Aminoguanidine (AMG), an AGE inhibitor, prevented the reduction in the EEM, arterial elastin content and AGE accumulation in mouse aortic segments treated with PVAT conditioned media in the HF group. Conclusions Our data demonstrate efficacy for chronic continuous and interval exercise to prevent coronary artery stiffness via inhibition of PVAT-derived AGE secretion in a pre-clinical mini-swine model of pressure overload-induced HF.

The natural product colletoic acid (CA) is a selective inhibitor of 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11ß-HSD1), which primarily converts cortisone to the active glucocorticoid (GC) cortisol. Here, CA's mode of action and its potential as a chemical tool to study intracellular GC signaling in adipogenesis are disclosed. 11ß-HSD1 biochemical studies of CA indicated that its functional groups at C-1, C-4, and C-9 were important for enzymatic activity; an X-ray crystal structure of 11ß-HSD1 bound to CA at 2.6 Å resolution revealed the nature of those interactions, namely, a close-fitting and favorable interactions between the constrained CA spirocycle and the catalytic triad of 11ß-HSD1. Structure-activity relationship studies culminated in the development of a superior CA analogue with improved target engagement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CA selectively inhibits preadipocyte differentiation through 11ß-HSD1 inhibition, suppressing other relevant key drivers of adipogenesis (i.e., PPAR<U+03B3>, PGC-1a), presumably by negatively modulating the glucocorticoid signaling pathway. The combined findings provide an in-depth evaluation of the mode of action of CA and its potential as a tool compound to study adipose tissue and its implications in metabolic syndrome.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Epicardial adipose thickness (EAT) is increased in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is thought to contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population. Given that CVD risk factors emerge early in life, the purpose of this study was to identify whether EAT is increased in pediatric patients with T1D compared with non-diabetic controls.METHODS: Anthropometric data, blood pressure (BP), and EAT were evaluated in 20 youth with T1D and 20 age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) matched healthy controls between the ages of 5 and 18 years.RESULTS: EAT was 18.5% higher among youth with T1D compared to healthy controls (1.65<U+2009>± 0.44<U+2009>mm vs 1.37<U+2009>± 0.27<U+2009>mm, P =<U+2009>.02). In the entire cohort, EAT was correlated with age (r = 0.71, P &lt;<U+2009>.001), BMI (r =<U+2009>.69, P &lt;<U+2009>.001), waist circumference (r = 0.60, P &lt;<U+2009>.001), systolic BP (r =<U+2009>.34, P<U+2009>= .03), and diastolic BP (r = 0.41, P<U+2009>= .009). Among youth with T1D, there were no significant correlations between EAT and HbA1c (r =<U+2009>-0.16, P =<U+2009>.50), insulin dose (r =<U+2009>.09, P =<U+2009>.71), or duration of disease (r = 0.06, P =<U+2009>.82).CONCLUSIONS: Youth with T1D exhibited significantly higher EAT compared to controls. Increased EAT was associated with adiposity and BP, but not duration of disease, insulin dose, or glycemic control. Increased EAT may represent a pathophysiologic mechanism leading to premature CVD in pediatric patients with T1D.

BACKGROUND: Olanzapine, regarded as one of the most efficacious antipsychotic medications for the treatment of schizophrenia, is associated with a high risk of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. ALKS 3831, a clinical candidate for treatment of schizophrenia, is a combination of olanzapine and samidorphan, an opioid receptor antagonist. The addition of samidorphan is intended to mitigate weight gain and the metabolic dysregulation associated with the use of olanzapine.METHODS: Non-clinical studies were conducted to assess the metabolic effects of olanzapine and samidorphan alone and in combination at clinically relevant exposure levels.RESULTS: Chronic olanzapine administration in male and female rats shifted body composition by increasing adipose mass, which was accompanied by an increase in the rate of weight gain in female rats. Co-administration of samidorphan normalized body composition in both sexes and attenuated weight gain in female rats. In hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp experiments conducted prior to measurable changes in weight and/or body composition, olanzapine decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in muscle while increasing uptake in adipose tissue. Samidorphan appeared to normalize glucose utilization in both tissues, but did not restore hepatic insulin sensitivity. In subsequent studies, samidorphan normalized olanzapine-induced decreases in whole-body glucose clearance following bolus insulin administration. Results from experiments in female monkeys paralleled the effects in rats.CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine administration increased weight gain and adiposity, both of which were attenuated by samidorphan. Furthermore, the combination of olanzapine and samidorphan prevented olanzapine-induced insulin insensitivity. Collectively, these data indicate that samidorphan mitigates several metabolic abnormalities associated with olanzapine in both the presence and the absence of weight gain.

Brown and brown-like adipocytes (BBAs) control thermogenesis and are detected in adult humans. They express UCP1, which transforms energy into heat. They appear as promising cells to fight obesity. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms leading to the browning of human white adipocytes or the whitening of BBAs represents a goal to properly and safely control the pathways involved in these processes. Here, we analyzed how drugs endowed with therapeutic potential affect the differentiation of human adipose progenitor-cells into BBAs and/or their phenotype. We showed that HIV-protease inhibitors (PI) reduced UCP1 expression in BBAs modifying their metabolic profile and the mitochondria functionality. Lopinavir (LPV) was more potent than darunavir (DRV), a last PI generation. PPAR<U+03B3> and PGC-1a were decreased in a PI or cell-specific manner, thus altering UCP1's constitutive expression. In addition, LPV altered p38 MAPK phosphorylation, blunting then the ß-adrenergic responses. In contrast, low doses of resveratrol stimulated the activatable expression of UCP1 in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner and counteracted the LPV induced loss of UCP1. This effect was independent of the resveratrol-induced sirtuin-1 expression. Altogether our results uncover how drugs impact crucial components of the networks regulating the expression of the thermogenic signature. They provide important information to control the relevant pathways involved in energy expenditure.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) constitute a promising tool in regenerative medicine and can be isolated from different human tissues. However, their biological properties are still not fully characterized. Whereas MSCs from different tissue exhibit many common characteristics, their biological activity and some markers are different and depend on their tissue of origin. Understanding the factors that underlie MSC biology should constitute important points for consideration for researchers interested in clinical MSC application.AIM: To characterize the biological activity of MSCs during longterm culture isolated from: bone marrow (BM-MSCs), adipose tissue (AT-MSCs), skeletal muscles (SM-MSCs), and skin (SK-MSCs).METHODS: MSCs were isolated from the tissues, cultured for 10 passages, and assessed for: phenotype with immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, multipotency with differentiation capacity for osteo-, chondro-, and adipogenesis, stemness markers with qPCR for mRNA for Sox2 and Oct4, and genetic stability for p53 and c-Myc; 27 bioactive factors were screened using the multiplex ELISA array, and spontaneous fusion involving a co-culture of SM-MSCs with BM-MSCs or AT-MSCs stained with PKH26 (red) or PKH67 (green) was performed.RESULTS: All MSCs showed the basic MSC phenotype; however, their expression decreased during the follow-up period, as confirmed by fluorescence intensity. The examined MSCs express CD146 marker associated with proangiogenic properties; however their expression decreased in AT-MSCs and SM-MSCs, but was maintained in BM-MSCs. In contrast, in SK-MSCs CD146 expression increased in late passages. All MSCs, except BM-MSCs, expressed PW1, a marker associated with differentiation capacity and apoptosis. BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs expressed stemness markers Sox2 and Oct4 in long-term culture. All MSCs showed a stable p53 and c-Myc expression. BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs maintained their differentiation capacity during the follow-up period. In contrast, SK-MSCs and SM-MSCs had a limited ability to differentiate into adipocytes. BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs revealed similarities in phenotype maintenance, capacity for multilineage differentiation, and secretion of bioactive factors. Because AT-MSCs fused with SM-MSCs as effectively as BM-MSCs, AT-MSCs may constitute an alternative source for BM-MSCs.CONCLUSION: Long-term culture affects the biological activity of MSCs obtained from various tissues. The source of MSCs and number of passages are important considerations in regenerative medicine.

Antimicrobial drugs of several classes play an important role in the treatment of bone and joint infections. In addition to fighting pathogenic microorganisms, the effects of drugs on local tissues and cells are also related to the course and prognosis of bone and joint infections. The multi-directional differentiation potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is essential for tissue repair after local injury, which is directly related to the recovery of bone, cartilage, and medullary adipose tissue. Our previous studies and the literature indicate that certain antimicrobial agents can regulate the differentiation potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs. Here, in order to systematically analyze the effects of various antimicrobial drugs on local tissue regeneration, we comprehensively review the studies on the effects of these drugs on MSC differentiation, and classify them according to the three differentiation directions (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis). Our review demonstrates the specific effects of different antimicrobial agents on bone marrow-derived MSCs and the range of concentrations at which they work, and provides a basis for drug selection at different sites of infection.

Juvenile-onset systemic sclerosis (jSSc) is a rare and severe autoimmune disease with associated life-threatening organ inflammation and evidence of fibrosis. The organ manifestations of jSSc resemble adult SSc, but with better outcomes and survival. The etiology of jSSc appears to reflect adult-onset SSc, with similar inflammatory mediators and autoantibodies, but with a significant population of children with uncharacterized anti-nuclear antibodies. The genetics of patients with jSSc differ from women with SSc, resembling instead the genes of adult males with SSc, with additional HLA genes uniquely associated with childhood-onset disease. Current treatments are aimed at inhibiting the inflammatory aspect of disease, but important mechanisms of fibrosis regulated by dermal white adipose tissue dendritic cells may provide an avenue for targeting and potentially reversing the fibrotic stage.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the leading cause of chronic liver injury and the third most common reason for liver transplantations in Western countries. It is unclear so far how different fat sources in Western diets (WD) influence the development of NASH. Our study investigates the impact of non-trans fat (NTF) and corn oil (Corn) as fat source in a WD mouse model of steatohepatitis on disease development and progression. C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) mice were fed &quot;standard&quot; WD (WD-Std), WD-NTF or WD-Corn for 24 weeks. WT animals treated with WD-NTF exhibit distinct features of the metabolic syndrome compared to WD-Std and WD-Corn. This becomes evident by a worsened insulin resistance and elevated serum ALT, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels compared to WD-Corn. Animals fed WD-Corn on the contrary tend to a weakened disease progression in the described parameters. After 24 weeks feeding with WD-NTF and WD-Std, WD-Corn lead to a comparable steatohepatitis initiation by histomorphological changes and immune cell infiltration compared to WD-Std. Immune cell infiltration results in a significant increase in mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a, which is more pronounced in WD-NTF compared to WD-Std and WD-Corn. Interestingly the fat source has no impact on the composition of accumulating fat within liver tissue as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging of multiple lipid classes. The described effects of different fat sources on the development of steatohepatitis finally resulted in variations in fibrosis development. Animals treated with WD-NTF displayed massive collagen accumulation, whereas WD-Corn even seems to protect from extracellular matrix deposition. Noteworthy, WD-Corn provokes massive histomorphological modifications in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and severe accumulation of extracellular matrix which are not apparent in WD-Std and WD-NTF treatment. Different fat sources in WD-Std contribute to strong steatohepatitis development in WT mice after 24 weeks treatment. Surprisingly, corn oil provokes histomorphological changes in eWAT tissue. Accordingly, both WD-NTF and WD-Corn appear suitable as alternative dietary treatment to replace &quot;standard&quot; WD-Std as a diet mouse model of steatohepatitis whereas WD-Corn leads to strong changes in eWAT morphology.

Adipose tissue (AT) is composed not only of adipocytes, but also of macrophages, endothelial cells and preadipocytes. Macrophages are an important component of AT, and are involved in tissue homeostasis, tissue repair and fibrosis. AT-resident macrophages are categorized into two subtypes, the M1-like and M2-like macrophages. M2-like macrophages are reported to play anti-inflammatory roles, and to be involved in clearing and removal of dying/dead adipocytes, and recruiting adipocyte progenitors (APs). M2-like macrophages are also reported to be involved in the promotion of fibrosis in a transforming growth factor-ß-dependent manner. However, the precise roles of M2-like macrophages in the AT have not yet been clearly delineated. Recently, we generated genetically engineered transgenic mice in which CD206<sup>+</sup> M2-like macrophages can be conditionally depleted. Unexpectedly, we found that the depletion of CD206<sup>+</sup> M2-like macrophages resulted in the enhanced generation of smaller adipocytes, improved insulin sensitivity and proliferation of APs. We further clarified that the CD206<sup>+</sup> M2-like macrophages directly interact with the APs to regulate their growth/differentiation and adipogenesis, thereby controlling adiposity and systemic insulin sensitivity. In the present review, we discuss how CD206<sup>+</sup> M2-like macrophages provide a niche for APs and maintain glucose homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a systemic catabolic condition affecting skeletal muscle and fat. We aimed to determine whether cardiac atrophy occurs in this condition and assess its association with cardiac function, symptoms, and clinical outcomes.METHODS: Treatment naïve metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients (n = 50) were assessed prior to and 4 months after commencement of carboplatin-based palliative chemotherapy. Methods included echocardiography for left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV function [LV ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain (GLS), diastolic function], computed tomography to quantify skeletal muscle and total adipose tissue, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), validated questionnaires for dyspnoea and fatigue, plasma biomarkers, tumour response to therapy, and overall survival.RESULTS: During 112 ± 6 days, the median change in LVM was -8.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -10.8 to -4.8, P &lt; 0.001]. Quartiles of LVM loss were -20.1%, -12.9%, -4.8%, and +5.5%. Losses of muscle, adipose tissue, and LVM were frequently concurrent; LVM loss &gt; median value was associated with loss of skeletal muscle [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4-14.8, P=0.01] and loss of total adipose tissue (OR = 10.0, 95% CI: 2.7-36.7, P &lt; 0.001). LVM loss was associated with decreased GLS (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9-22.7, P=0.003) but not with LV ejection fraction or diastolic function. In the population overall, plasma levels of C-reactive protein (P=0.008), high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) (P=0.03), and galectin-3 (P=0.02) increased over time, while N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and hs-cTnI did not change over time. C-reactive protein was the only biomarker associated with LVM loss but at the univariate level only. Independent predictors of LVM loss were prior weight loss (adjusted OR = 10.2, 95% CI: 2.2-46.9, P=0.003) and tumour progression (adjusted OR = 14.6, 95% CI: 1.4-153.9, P=0.02). LVM loss was associated with exacerbations of fatigue (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9-22.7, P=0.003), dyspnoea (OR = 9.3, 95% CI: 2.4-35.8, P&lt;0.001), and deterioration of performance status (OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.3-18.3,P=0.02). Patients with concurrent loss of LVM, skeletal muscle, and fat were more likely to deteriorate in all three symptom domains and to have reduced survival (P=0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Intense LVM atrophy is associated with non-small cell lung cancer-induced cachexia. Loss of LVM was associated with emerging alterations of GLS, indicating subtle changes in left ventricular function. Longer term studies are needed to assess the full scope of cardiac atrophy and its impact. LVM atrophy arises in conjunction with losses of fat and skeletal muscle and is temporally associated with meaningful declines in performance status, worsening of fatigue, and dyspnoea, as well as poorer tumour response and decreased survival. The specific contribution of LVM atrophy to these outcomes requires further study.

Promoting brown adipose tissue (BAT) formation and function reduces obesity. Ellagic Acid (EA), located abundantly in plant extracts and fruits, has been shown to modulate formation and differentiation of adipocytes, although its role in the process of browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has not been elucidated. In this study, fifty-six five-week old SD rats were randomly assigned to receive normal diet (ND, 10% lipids) or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% lipid) with or without various dosages of EA for 24 weeks. Our results showed that high fat diet intake triggered overweight, glucose intolerance and white adipocyte hypertrophy, the effects of which were mitigated by EA treatment. Meanwhile, EA supplementation reduced serum resistin levels, improved hepatic steatosis and serum lipid profile in DIO (high fat diet induced obesity) rats. Moreover, EA supplementation significantly decreased mRNA expression of Zfp423 and Aldh1a1, the key determinants of WAT plasticity. EA also increased mRNA expression of brown adipocyte markers including UCP1, PRDM16, Cidea, PGC1a, Ppar-a; beige markers including CD137and TMEM26; mitochondrial biogenesis markers including TFAM in inguinal WAT (iWAT) when compared to their counterparts. EA treatment significantly improved mitochondrial function, as measured by citrate synthase activity. More importantly, EA markedly elevated the expression of UCP1 in iWAT, which is a specific protein of brown adipocyte. In conclusion, our results provided evidence that EA improved obesity-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in DIO rats via browning of iWAT through suppressing white adipocyte maintaining genes and promoting expression of key thermogenic genes. These findings suggest that EA could be a promising therapeutic avenue to treat metabolic diseases.

Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2O (UBE2O) is expressed preferentially in metabolic tissues, but its role in regulating energy homeostasis has yet to be defined. Here we find that UBE2O is markedly upregulated in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes and show that whole-body disruption of Ube2o in mouse models in vivo results in improved metabolic profiles and resistance to high-fat diet-induced (HFD-induced) obesity and metabolic syndrome. With no difference in nutrient intake, Ube2o-/- mice were leaner and expended more energy than WT mice. In addition, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies revealed that Ube2o-/- mice were profoundly insulin sensitive. Through phenotype analysis of HFD mice with muscle-, fat-, or liver-specific knockout of Ube2o, we further identified UBE2O as an essential regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism programs in skeletal muscle, but not in adipose or liver tissue. Mechanistically, UBE2O acted as a ubiquitin ligase and targeted AMPKa2 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation in skeletal muscle; further, muscle-specific heterozygous knockout of Prkaa2 ablated UBE2O-controlled metabolic processes. These results identify the UBE2O/AMPKa2 axis as both a potent regulator of metabolic homeostasis in skeletal muscle and a therapeutic target in the treatment of diabetes and metabolic disorders.

Kindlin-2 regulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion to and migration on the extracellular matrix. Our recent studies demonstrate important roles of kindlin-2 in regulation of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and skeletal development. In this study, we generated adipose tissue-specific conditional knockout of kindlin-2 in mice by using Adipoq-Cre BAC-transgenic mice. The results showed that deleting kindlin-2 expression in adipocytes in mice caused a severe lipodystrophy with drastically reduced adipose tissue mass. Kindlin-2 ablation elevated the blood levels of nonesterified fatty acids and triglycerides, resulting in massive fatty livers in the mutant mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). Furthermore, HFD-fed mutant mice displayed type II diabetes-like phenotypes, including elevated levels of fasting blood glucose, glucose intolerance, and peripheral insulin resistance. Kindlin-2 loss dramatically reduced the expression levels of multiple key factors, including PPAR<U+03B3>, mTOR, AKT, and ß-catenin proteins, and suppressed adipocyte gene expression and differentiation. Finally, kindlin-2 loss drastically reduced leptin production and caused a high bone mass phenotype. Collectively, these studies establish a critical role of kindlin-2 in control of adipogenesis and lipid metabolism as well as bone homeostasis.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cisplatin is an important chemotherapy to lung cancer, but it usually induces severe cachexia and acute kidney injury in patients. Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SB), commonly known as a skullcap, is a popular Chinese herbal medicine mainly used to treat inflammation, infection, and malignancy. In this study, we report the synergic effect of SB and cisplatin to Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, and the ameliorative effect of SB to cisplatin-induced cachexia and acute kidney injury.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extract of SB was applied by water boiling and lyophilization. The MTS assay was used to exam the in-vitro effects of SB and cisplatin on the LLC viability. In the animal experiment, male C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with LLC cells, and then treated by cisplatin intraperitoneally and the SB extract orally. Tumor volume, weights of tumor, murine body, white adipose tissue and gastrocnemius muscle, as well as serum levels of BUN and creatinine were measured during the experiment. Murine kidney sample was observed after the H&amp;E and annexin V staining.RESULTS: SB provided an enhancement of cisplatin action to inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In the animal experiment, SB improved the loss of murine body weight and gastrocnemius muscle, the elevating BUN level, and the apoptosis of renal tubular cells in mice receiving cisplatin therapy. Meanwhile, the current treatment of SB did not further interfere with the blood cell counts of mice receiving chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: SB can enhance the anti-cancer effect of cisplatin. It also attenuates cisplatin-induced cachexia and acute kidney injury.

Acellular matrices are widespread biomaterials used in surgical practice as tissue reinforcement and anatomical support to favor tissue regeneration. It is clear that a fundamental role in the regeneration of tissue is played by cell-material interaction. In this work, the interaction between a bovine pericardium membrane and human adult stem cells was investigated by microscopy analysis and gene expression analysis. Parallel cell cultures were prepared on the pericardium membrane or tissue culture plate. They were incubated in basal growth medium or in adipogenic differentiation medium to perform experiments on the seventh and the fourteenth day of culture. Results demonstrated that the membrane allows cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation of human stem cells. During adipogenic commitment on the membrane, the accumulation of cytoplasmatic lipid droplets and the expression of adipogenic gene PPARG, CEBPA, GLUT4, FABP4 and ADIPOQ were detected. Concurrently, a downregulation of mesenchymal stem cell gene CD29, CD90 and CD105 was detected. In basal medium, the adipogenic gene expression was up regulated while the mesenchymal markers were indifferently expressed. These findings suggest that the bovine pericardium membrane is a biocompatible matrix, and that their rough surface allows cell adhesion, spreading and proliferation. The surface morphology activates mechanochemical signals that stimulate the adipogenic commitment of stem cells in basal medium, and potentiate their commitment in adipogenic differentiation medium.

Nerve grafting has always been necessary when the contralateral C7 nerve root is transferred to treat brachial plexus injury. Acellular nerve allograft is a promising alternative for the treatment of nerve defects, and results were improved by grafts laden with differentiated adipose stem cells. However, use of these tissue-engineered nerve grafts has not been reported for the treatment of brachial plexus injury. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the outcome of acellular nerve allografts seeded with differentiated adipose stem cells to improve nerve regeneration in a rat model in which the contralateral C7 nerve was transferred to repair an upper brachial plexus injury. Differentiated adipose stem cells were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats and transdifferentiated into a Schwann cell-like phenotype. Acellular nerve allografts were prepared from 15-mm bilateral sections of rat sciatic nerves. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: acellular nerve allograft, acellular nerve allograft + differentiated adipose stem cells, and autograft. The upper brachial plexus injury model was established by traction applied away from the intervertebral foramen with micro-hemostat forceps. Acellular nerve allografts with or without seeded cells were used to bridge the gap between the contralateral C7 nerve root and C5-6 nerve. Histological staining, electrophysiology, and neurological function tests were used to evaluate the effect of nerve repair 16 weeks after surgery. Results showed that the onset of discernible functional recovery occurred earlier in the autograft group first, followed by the acellular nerve allograft + differentiated adipose stem cells group, and then the acellular nerve allograft group; moreover, there was a significant difference between autograft and acellular nerve allograft groups. Compared with the acellular nerve allograft group, compound muscle action potential, motor conduction velocity, positivity for neurofilament and S100, diameter of regenerating axons, myelin sheath thickness, and density of myelinated fibers were remarkably increased in autograft and acellular nerve allograft + differentiated adipose stem cells groups. These findings confirm that acellular nerve allografts seeded with differentiated adipose stem cells effectively promoted nerve repair after brachial plexus injuries, and the effect was better than that of acellular nerve repair alone. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University of China (approval No. 2016-150) in June 2016.

In the current study, we developed resveratrol (RES)-loaded solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN-RES) in order to improve insulin resistance through the upregulation of SNARE protein complex in rats with type 2 diabetes. The SLN-RES characteristics include the following: the average size of 248 nm, the zeta potential of - 16.5 mV, and 79.9% RES entrapment efficiency. The release profile of SLN-RES showed an initial burst followed by a sustained release in natural condition. Infrared spectroscopy results revealed good incorporation of RES into core SLN. Spherical nanoparticle with less aggregation was observed under electronic microscopic examination. Oral administration of SLN-RES prevented weight loss and showed better hypoglycemic effect than RES. Serum oxidative stress status was restored to the normal level by SLN-RES. Furthermore, expression of synaptosomal-associated protein 23 (Snap23), syntaxin-4 (Stx4), and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (Vamp2) as the major elements of SNARE protein complex were reduced by SLN-RES more significantly than RES treatment in muscle tissue. However, SLN-RES has a similar effect to RES treatment in adipose tissue. Taken together, our results revealed SLN-RES could be a modern and interestingly therapeutic approach for the improvement of insulin resistance through targeting the expression of Snap23, Stx4, and Vamp2 in adipose and muscle tissues.

Immune cells infiltrate adipose tissues and provide a framework to regulate energy homeostasis. However, the precise underlying mechanisms and signaling by which the immune system regulates energy homeostasis in metabolic tissues remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the AT-rich interactive domain 5A (Arid5a), a cytokine-induced nucleic acid binding protein, is important for the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis. Long-term deficiency of Arid5a in mice results in adult-onset severe obesity. In contrast, transgenic mice overexpressing Arid5a are highly resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Inhibition of Arid5a facilitates the in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and fibroblasts to adipocytes, whereas its induction substantially inhibits their differentiation. Molecular studies reveal that Arid5a represses the transcription of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 (Ppar-<U+03B3>2) due to which, in the absence of Arid5a, Ppar-<U+03B3>2 is persistently expressed in fibroblasts. This phenomenon is accompanied by enhanced fatty acid uptake in Arid5a-deficient cells, which shifts metabolic homeostasis toward prolipid metabolism. Furthermore, we show that Arid5a and Ppar-<U+03B3>2 are dynamically counterregulated by each other, hence maintaining adipogenic homeostasis. Thus, we show that Arid5a is an important negative regulator of energy metabolism and can be a potential target for metabolic disorders.

Sclerosing mesenteritis is a rare benign disease presenting with chronic inflammation of the mesenteric adipose tissue and variable degrees of fibrosis. A 47-year-old black man presented to the emergency department with symptoms of small bowel obstruction, requiring surgical treatment. The laparotomy revealed a stenosis of the distal ileum with mesenteric thickening and an enterectomy was performed. The postoperative period was complicated by the maintenance of bowel obstruction. The patient underwent a second laparotomy, in which the fibrosing process of the mesentery was much aggravated, and an ileo-colic resection was needed. After knowledge of the histological diagnosis, the patient was started on immunomodulators with clinical improvement. At 26 months of follow-up, patient is asymptomatic under medical treatment. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient with progressive fibrosis in such short period of time requiring surgical re-intervention for bowel obstruction, owing to sclerosing mesenteritis.

OBJECTIVE: Growth differentiation factors (GDFs) and bone-morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor ß (TGFß) superfamily and are known to play a central role in the growth and differentiation of developing tissues. Accumulating evidence, however, demonstrates that many of these factors, such as BMP-2 and -4, as well as GDF15, also regulate lipid metabolism. GDF10 is a divergent member of the TGFß superfamily with a unique structure and is abundantly expressed in brain and adipose tissue; it is also secreted by the latter into the circulation. Although previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of GDF10 reduces adiposity in mice, the role of circulating GDF10 on other tissues known to regulate lipid, like the liver, has not yet been examined.CONCLUSION: Our work delineates a hepatoprotective role of GDF10 as an adipokine capable of regulating hepatic lipid levels by blocking de novo lipogenesis to protect against ER stress and liver injury.

BACKGROUND: South Asians have a high risk to develop type 2 diabetes, which may be related to substantial ectopic fat deposition. Since glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues can reduce ectopic fat accumulation, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of treatment with liraglutide for 26 weeks on ectopic fat deposition and HbA1c in South Asian patients with type 2 diabetes.METHODS: In a placebo-controlled trial, 47 South Asian patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to treatment with liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) or placebo added to standard care. At baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment we assessed abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, epicardial and paracardial adipose tissue volume using MRI. Furthermore, myocardial and hepatic triglyceride content were examined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.CONCLUSIONS: While the intention-to-treat analysis did not show effects of liraglutide on ectopic fat and HbA1c, per-protocol analysis showed that liraglutide decreases visceral adipose tissue volume, which was associated with improved glycaemic control in South Asians.

Circumference measurements have been used to estimate muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) in clinical settings. Measurements of thigh circumference are affected by muscle and subcutaneous fat (SF). In fact, SF could increase over a short period. Therefore, clarifying the relationship between thigh circumference and muscle and SF following ACL reconstruction is important. This study's primary purpose was to examine pre- and post-operative changes in thigh circumference, thigh muscles and SF CSAs in both legs. Secondary, the relationship between thigh circumference and muscle and SF CSAs was examined to demonstrate that circumference measurements could be used to detect atrophy. Quadriceps, hamstrings, and SF CSAs at 15, 10, and 5<U+2009>cm proximal to the patella were measured by MRI pre- and 4 weeks postoperatively to examine how reconstruction affected those tissues in the thighs. The results showed increases in SF CSA (r=0.72 at 10<U+2009>cm, r=0.67 at 15<U+2009>cm) greatly affected thigh circumference in females on the surgical side. In males, increases in SF CSA (r=0.83) at 15- and 5-cm and decreases in quadriceps muscle CSA (r=0.73) at 5 cm affected thigh circumference on the surgical side. Thigh circumference measurements might not reflect actual muscle CSA in ACL patients.

Obesity, a risk factor for the development of type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hepatic steatosis and some cancers, has been ranked in the top 10 health risk in the world by the World Health Organization. Despite the growing body of literature evidencing an association between the obesity epidemic and specific chemical exposure across a wide range of animal taxa, very few studies assessed the effects of chemical mixtures and environmental samples on lipid homeostasis. Additionally, the mode of action of several chemicals reported to alter lipid homeostasis is still poorly understood. Aiming to fill some of these gaps, we combined an in vivo assay with the model species zebrafish (Danio rerio) to screen lipid accumulation and evaluate expression changes of key genes involved in lipid homeostasis, alongside with an in vitro transactivation assay using human and zebrafish nuclear receptors, retinoid X receptor a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3>. Zebrafish larvae were exposed from 4 th day post-fertilization until the end of the experiment (day 18), to six different treatments: experimental control, solvent control, tributyltin at 100<U+202F>ng/L Sn and 200<U+202F>ng/L Sn (positive control), and wastewater treatment plant influent at 1.25% and 2.5%. Exposure to tributyltin and to 2.5% influent led to a significant accumulation of lipids, with white adipose tissue deposits concentrating in the perivisceral area. The highest in vitro tested influent concentration (10%) was able to significantly transactivate the human heterodimer PPAR<U+03B3>/RXRa, thus suggesting the presence in the influent of HsPPAR<U+03B3>/RXRa agonists. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of complex environmental samples from a municipal waste water treatment plant influent to induce lipid accumulation in zebrafish larvae.

The subset of pro-inflammatory B cells, called late memory, tissue-like or double negative (DN), accumulates in the blood of elderly individuals. Here we show that DN B cells do not proliferate and do not make antibodies to influenza antigens, but they secrete antibodies with autoimmune reactivity, in agreement with their membrane phenotype (CD95+CD21-CD11c+) and their spontaneous expression of the transcription factor T-bet. These cells also increase in the blood of individuals with obesity and autoimmune diseases, but causative mechanisms and signaling pathways involved are known only in part. In the present paper we compare frequencies and metabolic requirements of these cells in the blood of healthy individuals of different ages and in the blood and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of individuals with obesity. Results show that DN B cells from young individuals have minimal metabolic requirements, DN B cells from elderly and obese individuals utilize higher amounts of glucose to perform autoimmune antibody production and enroll in aerobic glycolysis to support their function. DN B cells from the SAT have the highest metabolic requirements as they activate oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. DN B cells from the SAT also show the highest levels of ROS and the highest levels of phosphorylated AMPK (5'-AMP activated kinase) and Sestrin 1, both able to mitigate stress and cell death. This metabolic advantage drives DN B cell survival and function (secretion of autoimmune antibodies).

PURPOSE: To examine the possible relationship between abdominal adiposity parameters and the presence of colorectal cancer (CRC) and between these adiposity parameters and various histopathological findings of the tumor.METHODS: A total of 60 control subjects and 111 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), 63 with early-stage and 48 with advanced-stage disease, were enrolled. Medical data and abdominopelvic CT examinations of each study group were retrospectively reviewed. Abdominal adiposity parameters, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volume, and total adipose tissue (TAT) volume, were calculated on all slices of the CT examinations with specialized software, and results for each study group were compared. Adiposity parameters were also compared with tumor histopathologic findings.RESULTS: We found lower VAT and higher SAT volumes in advanced-stage CRC patients, compared to the early-stage group. However, this relationship was not statistically significant (P = 0.721 for VAT and P = 0.432 for SAT volumes). We detected significantly lower VAT and SAT volumes in the early-stage CRC group, when compared with the control group (P = 0.014 for both). There was no significant relationship between TAT volumes and the study groups (P = 0.06). No statistically significant relationship was detected between adipose tissue parameters and histopathological features of the CRC group (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: We found statistically significant lower VAT and SAT volumes in patients with early-stage CRC compared to the control group. Volumetric adipose tissue measurements may be more accurate than area measurements and can easily be performed on abdominopelvic CT examination, which is the routine imaging modality for CRC patients.

A better understanding of the differential mechanisms regulating the deposition and release of fat between intramuscular and external adipose tissues is very important to the quality of beef. Resveratrol is a natural activator of sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1), a NAD-dependent deacetylase involved in regulating the cell cycle, energy homeostasis and apoptosis in adipose tissue. To compare the molecular mechanisms underlying differential apoptosis in bovine intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes, we evaluated the effect of resveratrol on differentiated adipocytes. We found that resveratrol-induced apoptosis in bovine adipocytes by regulating SIRT1 activity. In addition, we report that bovine intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes exhibited differential responses to resveratrol. In particular, gene and protein expression of Bcl-2 was higher, whereas that of SIRT1, AMPKa, FOXO1, Bax and caspase-3 were lower in bovine subcutaneous adipocytes than in intramuscular adipocytes. After resveratrol-treatment, the extent of up- or down-regulation was higher in subcutaneous adipocytes than in intramuscular adipocytes. These data indicate that bovine subcutaneous adipocytes are more sensitive to apoptosis than intramuscular adipocytes following treatment with resveratrol by regulating SIRT1 activity.

BACKGROUND: Chronic consumption of most drugs of abuse leads to brain oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which inhibit the glutamate transporter GLT-1, proposed to perpetuate drug intake. The present study aimed at inhibiting chronic ethanol and nicotine self-administration and relapse by the non-invasive intranasal administration of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory secretome generated by adipose tissue-derived activated mesenchymal stem cells. The anti-addiction mechanism of stem cell secretome is also addressed.METHODS: Rats bred for their alcohol preference ingested alcohol chronically or were trained to self-administer nicotine. Secretome of human adipose tissue-derived activated mesenchymal stem cells was administered intranasally to animals, both (i) chronically consuming alcohol or nicotine and (ii) during a protracted deprivation before a drug re-access leading to relapse intake.RESULTS: The intranasal administration of secretome derived from activated mesenchymal stem cells inhibited chronic self-administration of ethanol or nicotine by 85% and 75%, respectively. Secretome administration further inhibited by 85-90% the relapse &quot;binge&quot; intake that occurs after a protracted drug deprivation followed by a 60-min drug re-access. Secretome administration fully abolished the oxidative stress induced by chronic ethanol or nicotine self-administration, shown by the normalization of the hippocampal oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio, and the neuroinflammation determined by astrocyte and microglial immunofluorescence. Knockdown of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 by the intracerebral administration of an antisense oligonucleotide fully abolished the inhibitory effect of the secretome on ethanol and nicotine intake.CONCLUSIONS: The non-invasive intranasal administration of secretome generated by human adipose tissue-derived activated mesenchymal stem cells markedly inhibits alcohol and nicotine self-administration, an effect mediated by the glutamate GLT-1 transporter. Translational implications are envisioned.

Obesity predisposes the affected individuals to several metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular and malignant pathologies and is a top risk factor for premature mortality. It is now well known that inflammation has a major causative role in obesity-associated disease development and that obesity favors the establishment of a pro-inflammatory milieu at the level of adipose microenvironment. These inflammatory signals result in a disruption of normal cellular-crosstalk between adipose and non-adipose components leading to an altered metabolic and immunological status and a dysfunctional phenotype. Abnormal secretion of adipokines - small adipose-derived signaling molecules - can further assist in the inflammatory processes to offset the adipose tissue towards a dysfunctional state. Although adipokines have been recognized as the link between obesity and pathogenesis, studies are needed to fully understand their mechanism of action and underscore their therapeutic value. Here, we have reviewed obesity-induced metabolic and immunological changes at the level of vasculature and emphasize on the importance of adipokines, particularly leptin, vaspin and visfatin, for their therapeutic relevance.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) are angiogenic cytokines in normal tissues and tumors. Evidence suggests that increased growth factor expression in adipose tissue leads to improved vascularity and decreased hypoxia, fibrosis, and inflammation, which may, in turn, reduce post-menopausal breast cancer risk.</AbstractText>: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) are angiogenic cytokines in normal tissues and tumors.

INTRODUCTION: Few studies on rheumatoid arthritis have investigated disease activity and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry including evaluation of visceral adipose tissue. Thus, we sought to verify the association between body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, including visceral adipose tissue, and inflammatory activity in long-standing established rheumatoid arthritis.METHODS: Seventy-eight postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (American College of Rheumatology 2010) were studied. Disease activity was assessed by composite indexes (DAS28, CDAI, SDAI) and C-reactive protein. Potential association between body composition and disease activity was analysed by Pearson correlation and Tukey´s test (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: High inflammatory activity that persists after a long disease duration was associated with both lower muscle and fat mass (including visceral adipose tissue), which is suggestive of more exuberant rheumatoid cachexia. Conversely, moderate activity was associated with greater visceral adipose tissue, which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. These results point to the existence of different body composition profiles according to inflammatory status and the importance of individualized approaches to muscle mass and adiposity according to disease activity level in long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.

The contribution of diet to cancer risk has been considered to be higher in advanced countries than in developing countries. In this paper, I review the current issues (a review of the relevant literature), and the effects of the dietary and nutrient intake on three types of gynecologic cancer (cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers). In cervical cancer, the most important roles of diet/nutrition in relation to cancer are prophylaxis and countermeasures against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The main preventive and reductive factors of cervical cancer are antioxidants, such as vitamin A, C, D and E, carotenoids, vegetables and fruits. These antioxidants may have different abilities to intervene in the natural history of diseases associated with HPV infection. For endometrial cancer, the increase in peripheral estrogens as a result of the aromatization of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue in obese women and insulin resistance are risk factors. Thus, we must mainly take care to avoid the continuous intake of fat energy and sugar. In ovarian cancer, the etiology has not been fully understood. To the best of our knowledge, the long-term consumption of pro-inflammatory foods, including saturated fat, carbohydrates and animal proteins is a risk factor. The intake of acrylamide is also a risk factor for both endometrial and ovarian cancer. Most papers have been epidemiological studies. Thus, further research using in vitro and in vivo approaches is needed to clarify the effects of the dietary and nutrient intake in detail.

In case of large injuries of skeletal muscles the pool of endogenous stem cells, i.e., satellite cells, might be not sufficient to secure proper regeneration. Such failure in reconstruction is often associated with loss of muscle mass and excessive formation of connective tissue. Therapies aiming to improve skeletal muscle regeneration and prevent fibrosis may rely on the transplantation of different types of stem cell. Among such cells are adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) which are relatively easy to isolate, culture, and manipulate. Our study aimed to verify applicability of ADSCs in the therapies of severely injured skeletal muscles. We tested whether 3D structures obtained from Matrigel populated with ADSCs and transplanted to regenerating mouse gastrocnemius muscles could improve the regeneration. In addition, ADSCs used in this study were pretreated with myoblasts-conditioned medium or anti-TGFß antibody, i.e., the factors modifying their ability to proliferate, migrate, or differentiate. Analyses performed one week after injury allowed us to show the impact of 3D cultured control and pretreated ADSCs at muscle mass and structure, as well as fibrosis development immune response of the injured muscle.

For the past decade, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been extensively studied as a potential therapy for obesity and metabolic diseases due to its thermogenic and glucose-consuming properties. It is now clear that the function of BAT goes beyond heat production, as it also plays an important endocrine role by secreting the so-called batokines to communicate with other metabolic tissues and regulate systemic energy homeostasis. However, despite numerous studies showing the benefits of BAT in rodents, it is still not clear whether recruitment of BAT can be utilized to treat human patients. Here, we review the advances on understanding the role of BAT in metabolism and its benefits on glucose and lipid homeostasis in both humans and rodents. Moreover, we discuss the latest methodological approaches to assess the contribution of BAT to human metabolism as well as the possibility to target BAT, pharmacologically or by lifestyle adaptations, to treat metabolic disorders.

Pterostilbene (PTE) is a natural dimethylated analog of resveratrol, which exerts antioxidative, hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects; however, the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PTE on diabetic rats and clarified the underlying mechanism. Diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin (STZ) and a high-sugar and high-fat diet. Rats were then treated with PTE (20, 40 and 80<U+202F>mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed to measure the glycometabolism of the diabetic rats at the end of the treatment. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and lipid profile were determined using an automatic biochemistry analyzer and serum inflammatory factors were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also analyzed by spectrophotometry to evaluate the anti-oxidant effects. The expression of proteins of PPAR<U+03B3> and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway related proteins in adipose tissue of the diabetic rats was analyzed by Western blotting. PTE treatment significantly reduced weight loss, FBG, insulin resistance, serum lipid levels and inflammatory factors. PTE treatment also inhibited oxidative stress by decreasing MDA expression and increasing SOD expression. Simultaneously, PTE treatment significantly ameliorated morphological impairment of the pancreas in diabetic rats. Furthermore, PTE treatment significantly increased the protein expression of PPAR<U+03B3>, PI3K, p-Akt, GLUT4 and IRS-1 in adipose tissues of diabetic rats. This study suggests that PTE can exert antidiabetic effects via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein 44 (ERp44) is a member of the PDI family, named for a molecular weight of 44 kD. White adipose tissue has metabolic and endocrine functions that are important to metabolism. The role of ERp44 in glucose and lipid metabolism is not known yet. The current study was undertaken to investigate the implication of ERp44 in glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, we generated and characterized ERp44<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We used type 2 diabetes models and ERp44 knockout mice to show the implication of ERp44 in glucose and lipid metabolism. Knockout newborns had lower blood glucose compared to wild-type. Adult knockouts had abnormal intraperitoneal, glucose, insulin and pyruvic acid tolerance. Lipocytes were smaller and fewer in knockout mice compared to wild-type. Knockouts resisted to high-fat diet-induced obesity. ERp44 expression in white adipose tissue decreased significantly in type 2 diabetes models. Results suggest that ERp44 is closely associated with glucose and lipid metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Exercise training may improve energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and oxidative capacities. Therefore, we hypothesized that physical training enhances white adipose tissue mitochondrial oxidative capacity from obese women.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mitochondrial respiratory capacity, mitochondrial content, and UCP1 gene expression in white adipose tissue from women with obesity before and after the physical training program.CONCLUSION: Physical training promotes an increase in mitochondrial content without changing tissue respiratory capacity, a reduction in mitochondrial uncoupling degree and UCP1 mRNA expression in WAT. Finally, it improved the resting metabolic rate, lipid oxidation and physical performance, independent of the body changing free, or fat mass in obese women.

2018 was the year of the first marketing authorization of an allogeneic stem cell therapy by the European Medicines Agency. The authorization concerns the use of allogeneic adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for treatment of complex perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease. This is a breakthrough in the field of MSC therapy. The last few years have furthermore seen some breakthroughs in the investigations to the mechanisms of action of MSC therapy. Although the therapeutic effects of MSCs have largely been attributed to their secretion of immunomodulatory and regenerative factors, it has now become clear that some of the effects are mediated through host phagocytic cells that clear administered MSCs and in the process adapt an immunoregulatory and regeneration supporting function. The increased interest in therapeutic use of MSCs and the ongoing elucidation of the mechanisms of action of MSCs are promising indicators that 2019 may be the dawn of the therapeutic era of MSCs and that there will be revived interest in research to more efficient, practical, and sustainable MSC-based therapies.

Across aging, adipose tissue (AT) changes its quantity and distribution: AT becomes dysfunctional with an increase in production of inflammatory peptides, a decline of those with anti-inflammatory activity and infiltration of macrophages. Adipose organ dysfunction may lead to age-related metabolic alterations. Aging is characterized by an increase in adiposity and a decline in brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots and activity, and UCP1 expression. There are many possible links to age-associated involution of BAT, including the loss of mitochondrial function, impairment of the sympathetic nervous system, age-induced alteration of brown adipogenic stem/progenitor cell function and changes in endocrine signals. Aging is also associated with a reduction in beige adipocyte formation. Beige adipocytes are known to differentiate from a sub-population of progenitors resident in white adipose tissue (WAT); a defective ability of progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate has been hypothesized with aging. The loss of beige adipocytes with age may be caused by changes in trophic factors in the adipose tissue microenvironment, which regulate progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on possible mechanisms involved in the reduction of BAT and beige activity with aging, along with possible targets for age-related metabolic disease therapy.

Best practices in fat transfer to the face focus on tissue harvest and processing techniques. This article discusses the role of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in mitigating tissue loss in grafting. Discrepancies among common practice and recent study results have propagated uncertainty with long-term results. Fortunately, recent increases in the understanding of these MSCs are leading providers to identify statistically more favorable tissue donor sites, harvest technique, and preparation methods to increase their concentration in transferred tissue. Future studies are needed to support or confound the long-term effects of MSC transfer on facial fat grafting.

Autologous fat grafting represents an attractive source for tissue engineering applications in the field of reconstructive medicine. However, in adipogenic differentiation protocols for human adipose-derived stem cells, the concentration of glucose and insulin varies considerably. With the intent to gain maximum tissue augmentation, we focused on the late phase of adipogenesis. In this study, we modified the differentiation protocol for adipose-derived stem cells by prolongation of the induction period and the application highly concentrated glucose and insulin. Human adipose-derived stem cells were isolated from subcutaneous depots and differentiated in a standard induction medium for the first two weeks, followed by two weeks with varying glucose and insulin concentrations. Morphological changes assessed using Oil-Red-O staining were examined for corresponding alterations in the expression of the adipogenic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Furthermore, glucose and lactate levels in conditioned media were monitored over the period of differentiation. We found high-glucose media increasing the level of lipid accumulation and the size of single droplets whereas insulin significantly showed a dose-dependent negative effect on fat storage. However, whereas high glucose stimulated PPAR<U+03B3> transcription, expression levels in insulin-treated cells remained constant. Results permit assumptions that a high-glucose medium intensifies the degree of differentiation in mature adipocytes providing conditions to promote graft volume while we have identified highly concentrated insulin treatment as an inhibitor of lipid storage in the late adipogenic differentiation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical, imaging and pathological features of congenital infiltrating lipomatosis of the face (CILF) and to discuss whether it is a subtype of hemifacial hyperplasia (HH).METHODS: Sixteen patients diagnosed with CILF were included in this study. All patients had undergone panoramic radiography and spiral CT examinations. Thirteen patients received biopsy, surgery treatment and pathological examination. The clinical documentation and imaging data were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: The cheeks (14/16), parotid glands (12/16), tongues (9/16), masticatory muscles (8/16) and the lips (7/16) were the most frequently affected soft tissue organs. The maxilla (14/16), zygoma (13/16), mandible (13/16) were involved among the maxillofacial bones. Dental malformations included macrodontia (8/16), poor formation of the roots (7/16), accelerated tooth germ development or premature eruption of permanent teeth (7/16) and missing of the permanent teeth (4/16). All malformations were restricted to one side of the face and did not trespass the middle line. Pathologically, CILF was featured by the diffuse infiltration of redundant mature adipose tissue into the tissue of the affected organ.CONCLUSION: CILF is a congenital developmental facial malformation characterized by infiltration of nonencapsulated, mature adipose tissue, resulting in facial soft and hard tissue hypertrophy and dental malformations in hemifacial structures. CILF could be considered as a subtype of HH.

BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis has co-evolved with the human host, adapting to exploit the immune system for persistence and transmission. While immunity to tuberculosis (TB) has been intensively studied in the lung and lymphoid system, little is known about the participation of adipose tissues and non-immune cells in the host-pathogen interaction during this systemic disease.METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were aerosol infected with M. tuberculosis Erdman and presence of the bacteria and the fitness of the white and brown adipose tissues, liver and skeletal muscle were studied compared to uninfected mice.FINDINGS: M. tuberculosis infection in mice stimulated immune cell infiltration in visceral, and brown adipose tissue. Despite the absence of detectable bacterial dissemination to fat tissues, adipocytes produced localized pro-inflammatory signals that disrupted adipocyte lipid metabolism, resulting in adipocyte hypertrophy. Paradoxically, this resulted in increased insulin sensitivity and systemic glucose tolerance. Adipose tissue inflammation and enhanced glucose tolerance also developed in obese mice after aerosol M. tuberculosis infection. We found that infection induced adipose tissue Akt signaling, while inhibition of the Akt activator mTORC2 in adipocytes reversed TB-associated adipose tissue inflammation and cell hypertrophy.INTERPRETATION: Our study reveals a systemic response to aerosol M. tuberculosis infection that regulates adipose tissue lipid homeostasis through mTORC2/Akt signaling in adipocytes. Adipose tissue inflammation in TB is not simply a passive infiltration with leukocytes but requires the mechanistic participation of adipocyte signals.

OBJECTIVE: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a key regulator of the metabolic and endocrine functions of adipose tissue. Increased SNS outflow promotes fat mobilization, stimulates non-shivering thermogenesis, promotes browning, and inhibits leptin production. Most of these effects are attributed to norepinephrine activation of the Gs-coupled beta adrenergic receptors located on the surface of the adipocytes. Evidence suggests that other adrenergic receptor subtypes, including the Gi-coupled alpha 2 adrenergic receptors might also mediate the SNS effects on adipose tissue. However, the impact of acute stimulation of adipocyte Gs and Gi has never been reported.METHODS: We harness the power of chemogenetics to develop unique mouse models allowing the specific and spatiotemporal stimulation of adipose tissue Gi and Gs signaling. We evaluated the impact of chemogenetic stimulation of these pathways on glucose homeostasis, lipolysis, leptin production, and gene expression.RESULTS: Stimulation of Gs signaling in adipocytes induced rapid and sustained hypoglycemia. These hypoglycemic effects were secondary to increased insulin release, likely consequent to increased lipolysis. Notably, we also observed differences in gene regulation and ex vivo lipolysis in different adipose depots. In contrast, acute stimulation of Gi signaling in adipose tissue did not affect glucose metabolism or lipolysis, but regulated leptin production.CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the significance of adipose Gs signaling in regulating systemic glucose homeostasis. We also found previously unappreciated heterogeneity across adipose depots following acute stimulation. Together, these results highlight the complex interactions of GPCR signaling in adipose tissue and demonstrate the usefulness of chemogenetic technology to better understand adipocyte function.

The aim was to study the effect of resveratrol on the interplay of inflammatory signals using three different cell models; a metabolic organ (liver), an endocrine organ (visceral adipose tissue, VAT) and an immune organ (head kidney leukocytes, HKL) following lipopolysaccharide challenge (LPS). Atlantic salmon HKL, liver cells and VAT were isolated from the same fish (n<U+202F>=<U+202F>5). Each cell type was cultured either as mono-cultures, as co-cultures between HKL-liver cells, liver cells-VAT and HKL-VAT. Triple -cultures included all three tissues. In all cultures of HKL, LPS induced transcription of IL-1ß, cox2, tnfa, IL-12, ccattß and Ahr were significantly inhibited by resveratrol (100, 200<U+202F>µM). Likewise, in all cultures of liver cells, the LPS induced expression of IL-1ß was inhibited by resveratrol (100 and 200<U+202F>µM). HKL, both mono-cultures and triple-cultures and VAT cocultured with liver cells, showed LPS induced cox2 transcription that was inhibited by resveratrol (100 and 200<U+202F>µM). In contrast, VAT cultured as triple cultures, resveratrol 200<U+202F>µM particularly, in the presence of LPS, seemed to increase the expression of IL-1ß and ccattß. Resveratrol did not significantly affect lox5 expression in any culture. HKL and VAT are the main producers of PGE2 in response to inflammatory stimuli. VAT showed high endogenous production of eicosanoids, particularly LTB4 and LTB5. Resveratrol inhibited bot LPS induced and endogenous eicosanoid production. Possible targets of resveratrol, Sirt1 and pAMPK were affected differently in the different cells and tissue studied.

OBJECTIVE: It is unclear how childhood adipose tissue deposition influences sex hormone profiles in later adolescence.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.PARTICIPANTS: Children (n = 418) with a mean age of 10.5 (1.5) years at visit 1 and 16.7 (1.2) at visit 2 in the Exploring Perinatal Outcomes among Children (EPOCH) Study.MEASUREMENTS: We used reverse-scale Cox proportional hazard models to assess associations between pubertal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (T), and oestradiol (E2) and childhood-to-puberty rate of change in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Models stratified by sex and adjusted for childhood adiposity, maternal factors, birthweight and pubertal onset, and then further adjusted for insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), leptin and hepatic fat fraction.RESULTS: Among boys, more rapid accumulation of either VAT or SAT was associated with lower testosterone at visit 2 (HR 0.86, and .96, respectively, both P &lt; .0001), independently of race/ethnicity, LH, leptin and hepatic fat fraction. Among boys, more childhood VAT was associated with lower testosterone in adolescence (HR 0.98, P = .003), but this association did not persist after adjustment for leptin or insulin. No associations were observed between either fat measure and oestradiol or DHEA in boys. In girls, no associations between childhood fat or fat accumulation and sex hormones were observed.CONCLUSIONS: More rapid accumulation of fat is associated with lower testosterone in boys. These associations suggest that fat growth influences androgen profiles in adolescent boys. Since fat accumulation is a modifiable risk factor, the study results provide a possible intervention target and time period for improving adult health.

AIM: Type 2 diabetes and obesity are diseases related to surplus energy in the body. Abnormal interaction between the hypothalamus and adipose tissues is a key trigger of energy metabolism dysfunction. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) regulate intercellular communication by transporting intracellular cargo to recipient cells thereby altering the function of recipient cells. This study aimed to evaluate whether adipocyte-derived EVs can act on hypothalamic neurons to modulate energy intake and to identify the EV-associated non-coding RNAs.METHODS: Confocal imaging was used to trace the uptake of labelled adipocyte-derived exosomes by hypothalamic anorexigenic POMC neurons. The effects of adipocyte-derived EVs on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway in POMC neurons were evaluated based on mRNA and protein expression in vitro using quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. In addition, adipocyte-derived EVs were injected into recipient mice, and changes in mice body weight and daily food intake were monitored. The biological effects of the EV-associated MALAT1 on POMC neurons were explored.RESULTS: Adipocyte-derived EVs were successfully transferred into POMC neurons in vitro. Results showed that adipocytes of obese mice secreted MALAT1-containing EVs, which increased appetite and weight when administered to lean mice. Conversely, adipocyte-derived EVs from lean mice decreased food intake and weight when administered to obese mice.CONCLUSION: Adipocyte-derived EVs play important roles in mediating the interaction between adipocytes and hypothalamic neurons. Adipocyte-derived EVs can regulate POMC expression through the hypothalamic mTOR signalling in vivo and in vitro, thereby affecting body energy intake.

Obesity is a major worldwide health threat. It is characterized by an abnormal adipose tissue overgrowth together with increased monocytes infiltration, causing inflammation and oxidative stress, events associated with several illnesses. Investigations have focused on the benefits of native fruit consumption, claiming these to be natural sources of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. It has been widely stated that berries are a source of the most antioxidant compounds, and, thus, seem highly promising to endure research efforts on these vegetal matrices. The present article describes botanical, chemical and biomedical features of the Chilean native berries, Aristotelia chilensis, Ugni molinae, and Berberis microphylla. This work aims to potentiate incoming research focused on the search for novel treatments for first-order diseases with these particular plant sources.

Immunotherapies demand for predictive biomarkers to avoid unnecessary adverse effects and costs. Analytic morphomics is the technique to use body composition measures as imaging biomarkers for underlying pathophysiology to predict prognosis or outcome to therapy. We investigated different body composition measures to predict response to immunotherapy. This IRB approved retrospective analysis encompassed 147 patients with ipilimumab therapy. Degree of macroangiopathy was quantified with the newly defined total plaque index (TPI), i.e. the body height corrected sum of the soft and hard plaque volume of the infrarenal aorta on portalvenous CT scans. Furthermore, mean psoas density (MPD), different adipose tissue parameters as well as degree of cerebral microangiopathy were extracted from the imaging data. Subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis encompassed TPI, MPD, serum LDH, S100B, age, gender, number of immunotherapy cycles as well as extent of distant metastases. TPI and MPD correlated positively with PFS in multivariate analysis (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001, respectively). Furthermore, single visceral organ and/or soft tissue involvement significantly decreased progression risk (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01), whereas increased S100B level showed a trend towards PFS shortening (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05). In conclusion, degree of macroangiopathy and sarcopenia were independent predictors for outcome to immunotherapy and of equivalent significance compared to other clinical biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol and obesity synergise to increase the risk of liver-related mortality. We examined the influence of adiposity on clinical outcomes in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and the underlying inflammatory crosstalk between adipose tissue (AT) and the liver.METHODS: A cohort of 233 patients with AH from the UK and USA provided data to analyse the effects of obesity in AH. Body mass index was corrected for the severity of ascites, termed cBMI. Inflammatory and metabolic profiling was undertaken by proteome analysis of human serum samples. The effect of alcohol on adipose tissue and CXCL11 expression was studied in 3<U+202F>T3-derived adipocytes and in mice using the high-fat diet-plus-binge ethanol model.FINDINGS: Obesity was common amongst patients with AH, seen in 19% of individuals. Obesity (HR 2.22, 95%CI 1.1-4.3, p<U+202F>=<U+202F>.022) and underweight (HR 2.38, 1.00-5.6, p<U+202F>=<U+202F>.049) were independently associated with mortality at 3<U+202F>months. Proteome analysis demonstrated multiple metabolic and inflammatory factors differentially expressed in obese AH verse lean AH, with CXCL11 being the most elevated factor in obese AH. In vitro analysis of cultured adipocytes and in vivo analysis of mouse models showed that alcohol induced CXCL11 expression in AT, but not in liver.INTERPRETATION: Obesity is common in AH and associated with a greater than two-fold increase in short-term mortality. Obese AH is associated with a different inflammatory phenotype, with the greatest elevation in CXCL11. These data confirm that adiposity is clinically important in acute alcohol-related liver disease and illustrate the adipose-liver inflammatory axis in AH.

BACKGROUD: Among various myocyte-derived bioactive molecules (myokines), ß-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) is a unique myokine that attenuates skeletal muscle insulin resistance and inflammation, increases browning of white adipose tissue, and enhances hepatic fatty acid oxidation, resulting in upregulated energy expenditure of the whole body. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BAIBA on the vascular endothelial cell function.METHODS: The mRNA levels of proinflammatory molecules, antioxidants, and their related transcription regulators were examined by quantitative RT-PCR in BAIBA-treated human aortic or umbilical vein endothelial cells (HAEC or HUVEC, respectively), with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a stimulation. The protein expression and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were determined by Western blot analysis.RESULTS: BAIBA pretreatment significantly suppressed the mRNA levels of the adhesion molecules in the TNF-a-stimulated HAEC and HUVEC. BAIBA treatment significantly increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant molecules, catalase, superoxide dismutases, thioredoxin, and gamma-glutamylcysteine ligases, together with mitochondrial biogenesis-related molecules, nuclear respiratory factor 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A. In addition, BAIBA treatment significantly increased the transcription factors that regulated these genes [i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-d, PPAR-<U+03B3>, estrogen-related receptor a (ERRa), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1ß]. Adenovirus-mediated PGC-1ß overexpression significantly increased the mRNA levels of all antioxidant molecules. The phosphorylation levels of AMPK and eNOS were unaltered by BAIBA.CONCLUSIONS: In vascular endothelial cells, BAIBA had antiatherogenic effects through the PGC-1ß-ERRa/PPAR-d and PPAR-<U+03B3> pathway. This can explain the beneficial effects of exercise on vascular endothelial function.

In Western societies where food is abundant, these excess nutrients are stored as fats mainly in adipose tissue. Fats are stored in structures known as lipid droplets, and a genome-wide screen performed in Drosophila cells has identified several genes that are important for the formation of these droplets. One group of genes found during this screen included those that regulate mRNA splicing. Previous work from our lab has identified some splicing factors that play a role in regulating fat storage; however, the full complement of splicing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism is still unknown. In this study, the levels of a number of serine-arginine (SR) domain containing splicing factors (RSF1, RBP1, RBP1-like, SF2 and Srp-54) were decreased using RNAi in the adult fat body to assess their role in the control of Drosophila metabolism. Decreasing SF2 and RBP1 showed increased triglycerides, while inducing RNAi towards RSF1, RBP1-Like and Srp-54 had no effect on triglycerides. Interestingly, the increased triglyceride phenotype in the SF2-RNAi flies was due to an increase in the amount of fat stored per cell while the RBP1-RNAi flies have more fat cells. In addition, the splicing of the ß-oxidation enzyme, CPT1, was altered in the SF2-RNAi flies potentially promoting the increased triglycerides in these animals. Together, this study identifies novel splicing factors responsible for the regulation of lipid storage in the Drosophila fat body and contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms, which influence the regulation of fat storage in adipose-like cells.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is expected to soon become the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. This may be due to the rising obesity prevalence, which is a recognized risk factor for PDAC. There is great interest in deciphering the underlying driving mechanisms of the obesity-PDAC link. Visceral adiposity has a strong correlation to certain metabolic diseases and gastrointestinal cancers, including PDAC. In fact, our own data strongly suggest that visceral adipose tissue inflammation is a strong promoter for PDAC growth and progression in a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC and diet-induced obesity. In this review, we will discuss the relationship between obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation and PDAC development, with a focus on the key molecular and cellular components in the dysfunctional visceral adipose tissue, which provides a tumor permissive environment.

Osteoporosis is a disease that leads to a loss of bone mass and to alterations in the bone microarchitecture that occur in a site-specific manner; however it remains controversial in the jaw. The involvement of bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in the bone metabolism has been suggested in several physiopathological contexts, such as in aging and osteoporosis. To test whether the BMAT content is related to mandibular bone loss, this study aimed to investigate the potential correlations between the trabecular bone microarchitecture on one hand and BMAT content and its spatial distribution in relation to bone surface on the other hand during aging and ovariectomy (OVX) during a long-term follow-up in a mature rat model. No age-related microarchitectural or BMAT changes were observed in the mandible. The OVX-induced bone loss was three-fold lower in the mandible than in the tibia and was observed only in the alveolar bone (not in the condyle). We also report a delayed increase in the mandibular BMAT content that remained 4-6-fold lower compared to tibia. This low BMAT content in the mandible was located at a distance from the trabecular bone surface (only 5% in contact with the bone surface versus 87% in the tibia). These findings highlight a specific mandibular response to OVX, in particular fewer microarchitectural alterations compared to that in the tibia. For the latter, the trabecular bone thickness and surface were correlated with the BMAT content. Oral functions may have a protective effect on the mandibular BMAT conversion in an OVX context.

Several authors have indicated that excess body weight can modify the electromyographic (EMG) amplitude due to the accumulation of subcutaneous fat. This accumulation of adipose tissue around the muscle would affect the metabolic capacity during functional activities. On the other hand, some authors have not observed differences in the myoelectric manifestations of fatigue between normal weight and obese people. Furthermore, these manifestations have not been investigated regarding EMG onset latency, which indicates a pattern of muscle activation between different muscles. The objective of this study was to determine whether an increase in body weight, skinfolds, and muscle fatigue modify the trapezius and serratus anterior (SA) onset latencies and to determine the scapular muscle recruitment order in fatigue and excess body weight conditions.</AbstractText>: Several authors have indicated that excess body weight can modify the electromyographic (EMG) amplitude due to the accumulation of subcutaneous fat.

This study compared the long-term effects of EY consumption under two diet conditions: normal (ND<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY) and high fat diet (HFD<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY), on lipid metabolism in mice. ND<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY did not increase serum triglycerides, total cholesterol hepatic triglyceride concentrations, adipose tissue accumulation and glucose impairment, not leading to fatty liver. HFD<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY markedly decreased adipose tissue accumulation, the triglyceride and total cholesterol, and improved serum HDL-C and blood glucose impairment compared with HFD. PLS-DA analyzes showed both ND<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY and HFD<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY could decrease serum C18:1 and MUFA. HFD<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY could further decrease hepatic C18:2 and PUFA and increase C18:1 and MUFA excretion, which were associated with lower expression of Elovl6 and higher expression of Scd1 in liver. These results suggest that HFD<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY significantly improved dyslipidemia caused by HFD through modifying lipid metabolism, and ND<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY did not adversely affect the biomarkers associated with dyslipidemia risk, but showed less obvious regulation of lipid metabolism than HFD<U+2009>+<U+2009>EY.

New strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance in humans are needed. Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) can stimulate energy expenditure and may be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, whether exercise training is an efficient stimulus to activate and recruit BAT remains to be explored. This study aimed to evaluate whether regular exercise training affects cold-stimulated BAT metabolism and, if so, whether this was associated with changes in plasma metabolites.</AbstractText>: New strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance in humans are needed.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Qutanhuoxue decoction on AQP7 and AQP9 expression in nonalcoholic fatty liver model rats. Nighty male SD rats (six weeks old, 250 ± 10<U+2009>g) were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal diet group (ND group), high-fat diet (HFD group), HFD + low dose Qd group, HFD + middle dose Qd group, and HFD + high dose Qd group. Rats in ND group were fed with a regular diet, while rats in other groups were fed with high-fat diet. After the success of the molding, HFD + low dose Qd group, HFD + middle dose Qd group, and HFD + high dose Qd group were, respectively, gavaged by Qutanhuoxue decoction with concentration of 4.5g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>, 9.0g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>, and 18g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>. The ND group and HFD group were gavaged by the same volume of physiological saline lavage, once a day. During the period of gavaging, the other four groups continue to be fed with high-fat fodder except ND group. All rats were killed at 14d, 21d, and 28d, respectively. HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of liver tissues and serum level of ALT AST GGT and TC TG was detected by automatic analyzer. The expression levels of liver AQP9 mRNA and adipose tissue AQP7 mRNA were detected by real-time PCR. Quhuoxue decoction can significantly reduce the liver function (ALT, AST, and GGT) and blood fat (TG, TC) levels of NAFLD rats and reduce the degree of liver fat degeneration. The effect was the best in the HFD + high dose Qd group of 28d. Qutanhuoxue decoction can decrease the expression of liver AQP9 mRNA and increase the expression of adipose tissue AQP7 mRNA. In conclusion, Qutanhuoxue decoction can reduce the degree of hepatic steatosis, which may be closely related to the increase of AQP7 expression in adipose tissue and the decrease of AQP9 expression in liver.

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory multisystemic disease with a complex pathogenesis consisting of genetic, immunological, and environmental components. It is associated with a number of comorbidities, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and myocardial infarction. In addition, the severity of psoriasis seems to be related to the severity of obesity. Patients with higher levels of obesity show poorer response to systemic treatments of psoriasis. Several studies have demonstrated that white adipose tissue is a crucial site of the formation of proinflammatory adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin and classical cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 6 and tumour necrosis factor-<i>a</i>. In psoriasis, due to the proliferation of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells, IL-22, among others, is produced in addition to the abovementioned cytokines. With respect to leptin and resistin, both of these adipokines are present in high levels in obese persons with psoriasis. Further, the plasma levels of leptin and resistin are related to the severity of psoriasis. These results strongly suggest that obesity, through proinflammatory pathways, is a predisposing factor to the development of psoriasis and that obesity aggravates existing psoriasis. Different inflammatory biomarkers link psoriasis and obesity. In this paper, the most important ones are described.

BACKGROUND: Intrauterine exposure to gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with increased adiposity; however, not all offspring exposed to GDM exhibit excess adiposity.OBJECTIVES: Examine whether optimal diet and activity behaviours in infancy, childhood, and adolescence modify the association between GDM exposure and adiposity.METHODS: In 564 offspring (84 exposed to GDM), we assessed breastfeeding (maternal recall), dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire), physical activity (3-day recall), and adiposity (BMI, waist-to-height ratio, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio) at 10.4 (SD, 1.5) and 16.7 (SD, 1.2) years. Optimal behaviours were defined as &gt;6 breastmilk months, Healthy Eating Index score &gt;60, and daily vigorous activity &gt;1 hour. Linear mixed models assessed the association between GDM exposure and adiposity among those with optimal versus suboptimal health behaviours, adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and pubertal status.RESULTS: GDM exposure was associated with increased skinfold ratio, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue among those with &lt;6 breastmilk months (all Ps &lt; .05), but only associated with increased skinfold ratio among those with &gt;6 breastmilk months (P = .01). GDM exposure was associated with increases in all adiposity measures among those with Healthy Eating Index scores &lt;60 (P &lt; .01), but not those with scores &gt;60 (P &gt; .10). GDM exposure was associated with increased BMI and subcutaneous adipose tissue among those with &gt;1 hour of vigorous activity (P &lt; .05) but not among those with &lt;1 hour of vigorous activity (P &gt; .30).CONCLUSIONS: The association of GDM exposure with excess adiposity is attenuated in offspring with more optimal diet and activity behaviours in infancy, childhood, and adolescence.

The aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic potential of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) from brown adipose tissue on erectile dysfunction (ED) in experimentally induced spinal cord injury in rats. 24 male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups; control, spinal cord injury (SCI)<U+2009>+<U+2009>vehicle, and SCI<U+2009>+<U+2009>AD-MSC. To induce SCI, a standard weight-drop method that induced a moderate to severe injury (100<U+2009>g/cm force) at T7-T10, was used. AD-MSC (3<U+2009>×<U+2009>105 cells /5<U+2009>µL) was applied by local transplantation into the region of injury. At the end of four-weeks, rats underwent neurological examinations and then intracavernosal and mean arterial pressures (ICP and MAP) measurements. After decapitation, spinal cord and cavernosal tissue samples were taken to analyze neuronal nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS), proto-oncogene protein c-FOS and nerve growth factor (NGF). Tissues were also examined histologically. Spinal cord injury caused decrease on NGF and n-NOS levels while c-FOS was increased. The ICP/MAP value in vehicle-treated SCI rats was found to be significantly higher than the control group. On the other hand, in SCI<U+2009>+<U+2009>AD-MSC group, all these parameters were reversed back to control levels. AD-MSC therapy may be beneficial against erectile dysfunction in experimentally induced SCI by ameliorating neuronal damage.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus is a complex metabolic disease commonly caused by insulin resistance in several tissues. We performed a matched two-dimensional metabolic screening in tissue samples from 43 multi-organ donors. The intra-individual analysis was assessed across five key metabolic tissues (serum, visceral adipose tissue, liver, pancreatic islets and skeletal muscle), and the inter-individual across three different groups reflecting T2D progression. We identified 92 metabolites differing significantly between non-diabetes and T2D subjects. In diabetes cases, carnitines were significantly higher in liver, while lysophosphatidylcholines were significantly lower in muscle and serum. We tracked the primary tissue of origin for multiple metabolites whose alterations were reflected in serum. An investigation of three major stages spanning from controls, to pre-diabetes and to overt T2D indicated that a subset of lysophosphatidylcholines was significantly lower in the muscle of pre-diabetes subjects. Moreover, glycodeoxycholic acid was significantly higher in liver of pre-diabetes subjects while additional increase in T2D was insignificant. We confirmed many previously reported findings and substantially expanded on them with altered markers for early and overt T2D. Overall, the analysis of this unique dataset can increase the understanding of the metabolic interplay between organs in the development of T2D.

Ceramides contribute to the lipotoxicity that underlies diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and heart disease. By genetically engineering mice, we deleted the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1), which normally inserts a conserved double bond into the backbone of ceramides and other predominant sphingolipids. Ablation of DES1 from whole animals or tissue-specific deletion in the liver and/or adipose tissue resolved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice caused by leptin deficiency or obesogenic diets. Mechanistic studies revealed ceramide actions that promoted lipid uptake and storage and impaired glucose utilization, none of which could be recapitulated by (dihydro)ceramides that lacked the critical double bond. These studies suggest that inhibition of DES1 may provide a means of treating hepatic steatosis and metabolic disorders.

Chronic low-grade adipose inflammation, characterized by aberrant adipokine production and pro-inflammatory macrophage activation/polarization is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Adipocyte fatty acid composition is influenced by dietary availability and may regulate adipokine secretion and adipose inflammation. After feeding F344 rats for 20 weeks with a Western diet or a fish oil-supplemented diet, we cultured primary rat adipose tissue in a three-dimensional explant culture and collected the conditioned medium. The rat adipose tissue secretome was assayed using the Proteome Profiler Cytokine XL Array, and adipose tissue macrophage polarization (M1/M2 ratio) was assessed using the iNOS/ARG1 ratio. We then assessed the adipokine's effects upon stem cell self-renewal using primary human mammospheres from normal breast mammoplasty tissue. Adipose from rats fed the fish oil diet had an <U+03C9>-3:<U+03C9>-6 fatty acid ratio of 0.28 compared to 0.04 in Western diet rats. The adipokine profile from the fish oil-fed rats was shifted toward adipokines associated with reduced inflammation compared to the rats fed the Western diet. The M1/M2 macrophage ratio decreased by 50% in adipose of fish oil-fed rats compared to that from rats fed the Western diet. Conditioned media from rats fed the high <U+03C9>-6 Western diet increased stem cell self-renewal by 62%±9% (X¯%±SD) above baseline compared to only an 11%±11% increase with the fish oil rat adipose. Modulating the adipokine secretome with dietary interventions therefore may alter stromal-epithelial signaling that plays a role in controlling mammary stem cell self-renewal.

Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a key role in nonshivering thermogenesis and is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. In a previous study, we generated adipocyte-specific UCP1 knock-in (UCP1-KI) pigs, which exhibited improved thermoregulatory ability and decreased fat deposition. To investigate whether UCP1 knock-in alters the lipid composition of adipose tissues, lipidomics of inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT) and backfat from 6-month-old cold-treated UCP1-KI pigs and wild-type (WT) pigs were profiled. In addition, genome-wide RNA-sequencing of iWAT was performed to further study the genetic basis for lipid alterations. The results showed that iWAT and backfat from UCP1-KI pigs exhibited distinct lipidomic profiles, as the mild lipid alteration was observed in backfat of UCP1 knock-in pigs. Inguinal WAT from UCP1-KI pigs contained significantly decreased total triacylglycerol (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05), together with the downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, suggesting the decreased lipogenesis in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Significantly increased levels of total sphingolipids (p&lt;0.05) were also observed in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs. Notably, two mitochondrial-specific lipid species, cardiolipin CL72:8 (18:2) and CL74:9 (18:2), were found to be dramatically increased in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial function. This observation was further supported by the significant upregulation of numerous mitochondrial-related genes and significantly increased number of large mitochondria and mitochondrial cristae in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Taken together, these data illustrate the specific role of UCP1 in lipid metabolism of fat tissues in pigs and provide new data for characterization of fat traits in UCP1-KI pigs.

In breast tumors, it is well established that intratumoral angiogenesis is crucial for malignant progression, but little is known about the vascular characteristics of extratumoral, cancer-adjacent breast. Genome-wide transcriptional data suggest that extratumoral microenvironments may influence breast cancer phenotypes; thus, histologic features of cancer-adjacent tissue may also have clinical implications. To this end, we developed a digital algorithm to quantitate vascular density in approximately 300 histologically benign tissue specimens from breast cancer patients enrolled in the UNC Normal Breast Study (NBS). Specimens were stained for CD31, and vascular content was compared to demographic variables, tissue composition metrics, and tumor molecular features. We observed that the vascular density of cancer-adjacent breast was significantly higher in older and obese women, and was strongly associated with breast adipose tissue content. Consistent with observations that older and heavier women experience higher frequencies of ER<sup>+</sup> disease, higher extratumoral vessel density was also significantly associated with positive prognostic tumor features such as lower stage, negative nodal status, and smaller size (&lt;2cm). These results reveal biological relationships between extratumoral vascular content and body size, breast tissue composition, and tumor characteristics, and suggest biological plausibility for the relationship between weight gain (and corresponding breast tissue changes) and breast cancer progression.

Among different types of dyslipidemia, familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is the most common genetic disorder, which is characterized by at least two different forms of lipid abnormalities: hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. FCHL is an important cause of cardiovascular diseases. FCHL is a heterogeneous condition linked with some metabolic defects that are closely associated with FCHL. These metabolic features include dysfunctional adipose tissue, delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, overproduction of very low-density lipoprotein and hepatic lipids, and defect in the clearance of low-density lipoprotein particles. There are also some genes associated with FCHL such as those affecting the metabolism and clearance of plasma lipoprotein particles. Due to the high prevalence of FCHL especially in cardiovascular patients, targeted treatment is ideal but this necessitates identification of the genetic background of patients. This review describes the metabolic pathways and associated genes that are implicated in FCHL pathogenesis. We also review existing and novel treatment options for FCHL. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 71(9):1221-1229, 2019.

It is well established that the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in cancer development and progression. The tumor microenvironment is composed of neoplastic cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts and other connective tissue cells, extracellular matrix components, multiple stem and progenitor cells, and a diverse array of innate and adaptive immune cells [Nat Rev Cancer 2007;7:139-147]. Understanding the mechanisms behind cell-cell communication in the tumor microenvironment is critical to understanding the drivers of tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this review, we discuss the interactions between adipose stem cells, a critical component of the tumor microenvironment, and various forms of cancer. Stem Cells 2019.

Obesity is a common metabolic disorder that has become a widespread epidemic in several countries. Sex and gender disparities in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been well-documented with premenopausal women having a lower incidence of CVD than age-matched men. However, women are more likely than men to suffer from obesity, which can predispose them to greater CVD risk. The mechanisms underlying high-fat diet (HFD)- or obesity-induced hypertension are not well defined, although immune system activation and inflammation have been implicated in several studies. Further, the sex of the subject can have a profound influence on the immune response to hypertensive stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to examine the impact of sex and gender on the role of the immune system in HFD-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction.

OBJECTIVE: To delineate potential mechanisms for fasting hyperglucagonemia in childhood obesity by studying the associations between fasting plasma glucagon concentrations and plasma lipid parameters and fat compartments.METHODS: Cross-sectional study of children and adolescents with obesity (n = 147) and lean controls (n = 43). Differences in free fatty acids (FFAs), triglycerides, insulin, and fat compartments (quantified by magnetic resonance imaging) across quartiles of fasting plasma glucagon concentration were analyzed. Differences in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucagon response was tested in high vs low FFAs, triglycerides, and insulin. Human islets of Langerhans were cultured at 5.5 mmol/L glucose and in the absence or presence of a FFA mixture with total FFA concentration of 0.5 mmol/L and glucagon secretion quantified.CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglucagonemia in childhood obesity is associated with hyperinsulinemia, high plasma FFAs, high plasma triglycerides, visceral adiposity, and IGT. The glucagonotropic effect of FFAs on isolated human islets provides a potential mechanism linking high fasting plasma FFAs and glucagon levels.

The crude drug Sojutsu, as defined by the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, is the rhizome of Atractylodes lancea De Candolle, Atractylodes chinensis Koidzumi, or their interspecific hybrids (Asteraceae). Sojutsu is one of the traditional Kampo formulas, which are administered to patients suffering from stomach disorders, edema, and nephrotic syndrome. Although antiinflammatory effects of Sojutsu have been reported, its effects on the liver and kidney have not been extensively investigated. Here, we used a Sojutsu sample identified as A. chinensis rhizome and isolated several constituents from its ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-soluble fraction that decreased production of the proinflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) in interleukin 1ß-treated rat hepatocytes. Among the constituents in this fraction, atractylodin showed the highest activity to suppress NO production, whereas hinesol, ß-eudesmol, and a-bisabolol showed low activity. Atractylodin decreased the levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor a, and lipocalin 2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The EtOAc-soluble fraction of the A. chinensis rhizome extract was administered daily for 20 weeks to high immunoglobulin A (HIGA) mice, whose pathological findings resemble human immunoglobulin A nephropathy. This fraction decreased the weight of white adipose tissue and decreased mesangial proliferation and immunoglobulin A deposition in glomeruli. These results indicate that the EtOAc-soluble fraction, which included antiinflammatory constituents, may be responsible for improvement of the mesangial lesions in HIGA mice.

PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of virtual monochromatic spectral (VMS) CT images at different energy levels on the effectiveness of a motion correction technique (SSF) in dual-energy Spectral coronary CT angiography (CCTA).MATERIALS AND METHODS: 29 cases suspected of or diagnosed with coronary artery disease underwent Spectral CCTA using a prospective ECG triggering with 250 ms padding time. SSF was applied to the determined least-motion phase to generate 6 additional sets of VMS images with energy levels from 40 to 100 keV. CT value and standard deviation (SD) in the aortic root and epicardial adipose tissue were measured. Image quality of the RCA, LAD and LCX was evaluated on a per-vessel basis in each patient. Two reviewers evaluated the artery using the score of the segment.RESULTS: The low energy VMS images increased CT value and image noise compared with higher-energy VMS images, except 90 keV and 100 keV. The CNR of 40-70 keV were higher than those of 80-100 keV (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). The image quality scores for images at 50-80 keV were higher than those of 40, 90, and 100 keV (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), and the VMS image quality at 50 keV and 60 keV with SSF was the highest.CONCLUSION: SSF can effectively reduce the motion artifacts when coronary vessels have suitable contrast enhancement which can be achieved by adjusting energy levels of VMS images.

Novel mechanisms and health benefits have been recently suggested for the antidepressant drug phenelzine, known as a non-selective MAO inhibitor. They include an anti-lipogenic action that could have an impact on excessive fat accumulation and obesity-related metabolic alterations. We evaluated the metabolic effects of an oral phenelzine treatment on mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Eleven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were fed a HFD and either a 0.028% phenelzine solution (HFD+PHE) or water to drink for 11 weeks. Phenelzine attenuated the increase in body weight and adiposity without affecting food consumption. Energy efficiency was lower in HFD+PHE mice. Lipid content was reduced in subcutaneous fat pads, liver and skeletal muscle. In white adipose tissue (WAT), phenelzine reduced sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels, inhibited amine-induced lipogenesis, and did not increase lipolysis. Moreover, HFD+PHE mice presented diminished levels of hydrogen peroxide release in subcutaneous WAT, and reduced expression of leukocyte transmigration markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines in visceral WAT and liver. Phenelzine reduced the circulating levels of glycerol, triacylglycerols, HDL-cholesterol and insulin. Insulin resistance was reduced, without affecting glucose levels and glucose tolerance. On the other hand, phenelzine increased rectal temperature and slightly increased energy expenditure. The mitigation of HFD-induced metabolic disturbances points towards a promising role for phenelzine in obesity treatment and encourages further research on its mechanisms of action. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Phenelzine reduces body fat, markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and insulin resistance in HFD mice. SSAO, MAO, PEPCK and SREBP1c are involved in the metabolic effects of phenelzine. Phenelzine could be potentially used for the treatment of obesity-related complications.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the formation of gap junctions between Schwann cells derived from differentiated adipose stem cells implanted in a rat model of dyskinesia induced by brain injury and its positive effect in promoting functional recovery of the rats.METHODS: In a rat model of hemiplegia induced by motor cortex injury, adipose stem cells or Schwann cells differentiated from adipose stem cells, either with or without RNAi-mediated silencing of Cx43, were transplanted orthotopically in the lesion. The recovery of the motor function of the rats was observed and scored after the transplantation. Rat brain tissues were sampled to detect the expressions of nerve growth factor (NGF) using Western blotting and RT-PCR.RESULTS: All the 3 cell transplantation therapies obviously improved the motor function scores of the rats as compared with the control rats. The expression of NGF in the brain tissue was significantly lower in the control group than in the cell transplantation groups. NGF expression in the brain tissues of rats receiving transplantation of Schwann cells with Cx43 gene silencing was lower than that in rats receiving Schwann cells without Cx43 silencing, and was similar with that in rats transplanted with adipose stem cells. The results of RT-PCR showed that NGF mRNA level in the control group was significantly lower than that in the other 3 groups. NGF mRNA expression was the highest in Schwann cell group without Cx43 silencing, followed by adipose stem cell group, and then by Schwann cell group with Cx43 silencing.CONCLUSIONS: In the rat model of dyskinesia induced by brain injury, transplantations of adipose stem cells and adipose stem cells-derived Schwann cells both promote the functional recovery of brain damage, in which gap junction protein Cx43 plays an important role to promote functional gap junction formation possibly by enhancing NGF expression.

Adipose tissue is highly involved in whole-body metabolism and is the main site for lipid synthesis, storage and mobilization in ruminants. Therefore, knowledge about adipose tissue responses to different diets is important, especially in growing heifers as the feeding regimes of replacement heifers affect their future success as dairy cows. However, at gene expression level such knowledge is limited. As part of a larger feed trial, adipose tissue biopsies from 24 Norwegian Red heifers were collected at 12 months of age (12MO) and at month seven of gestation (PREG) and analyzed by next-generation mRNA sequencing. Between these two sampling points, all heifers had gone through a successful conception and a feed change from four dietary treatments of high or low energy (HE/LE) and protein (HP/LP) content (treatments LPHE, HPHE, LPLE and HPLE) to a low-energy, low-protein pregnancy feed given to all animals. Gene expression differences between different feed treatments at 12MO are described in an earlier publication from our group. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the long-term effects of diets differing in protein and energy density level on gene expression in adipose tissue of growing replacement dairy heifers. To achieve this, we examined the post-treatment effects between the treatment groups at month seven of gestation; 6 months after the termination of experimental feeding, and the long-term gene expression changes occurring in the adipose tissue between 12MO and PREG. Post-treatment group comparisons showed evidence of long-term effects of dietary treatment on adipose gene expression. Differences between protein treatments were smaller than between energy treatments. Adipose gene expression changes from 12MO to PREG were much larger for the HE than the LE treatments and seemed to mostly be explained by the characteristics of the diet change. 97 genes displayed a unidirectional expression change for all groups from 12MO to PREG, and are considered to be treatment-independent, possibly caused by pregnancy or increased age. This study provides candidate genes and key regulators for further studies on pregnancy preservation (TGFB1, CFD) and metabolic regulation and efficiency (PI3K, RICTOR, MAP4K4,) in dairy cattle.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and anti-obesity effects of the Korean red ginseng extract in dogs. To this end, we fed healthy beagles a Korean red ginseng diet and/or snack for 8 weeks. The dogs were submitted to a thorough physical examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry analysis, analysis of adipose tissue activity, and body fat-content analysis by computed tomography (CT). At the end of the study period, the dogs that were fed the ginseng extract-diet/snack showed a significant decrease in body weight, body condition score and leptin levels relative to the baseline value. The CT findings revealed a decrease in body fat content in dogs fed the ginseng extract diet but not in those fed the ginseng-extract snack. The results of blood analysis did not show any meaningful changes in any of the dogs. All dogs tolerated the diet/snack well, and there were no adverse events. Our results suggest that the Korean red ginseng extract diet can potentially serve as an anti-obesity diet for reducing fat mass in dogs.

The aim of this study was investigate the effects of a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet introduced to rats soon after weaning. The animals were distributed in the following groups: LPHC45: fed an LPHC diet (6%-protein, 74%-carbohydrate) for 45 days; C45: fed a control (C) diet (17%-protein, 63%-carbohydrate) for 45 days; R (Reverse): fed with LPHC for 15 days followed by C diet for 30 days. The LPHC45 group showed alterations in the energetic balance with an increase in brown adipose tissue, and in glucose tolerance, and lower final body weight, muscle mass and total protein in blood when compared with C45 group. The HOMA-IR index was similar between LPHC45 and C45 groups, but this parameter was lower in LPHC45 compared with R groups. Serum adiponectin was higher in LPHC45 group than C45 and R groups. The R group presented higher fed insulin than C45 and LPHC45 and higher T4 compared with C45 group. Total cholesterol in R group was higher when compared with LPHC45 group. Thus, the data show that the change of the diet LPHC for a balanced diet led to different metabolic evolution and suggest that the different response can be due to different levels of adiponectin.

Body composition analysis, also referred to as analytic morphomics, morphomics, or morphometry, describes the measurement of imaging biomarkers of body composition such as muscle and adipose tissue, most commonly on computed tomography (CT) images. A growing body of literature supports the use of such metrics derived from routinely acquired CT images for risk prediction in various patient populations, including those with lung cancer. Metrics include cross-sectional area and attenuation of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous, visceral, and intermuscular adipose tissue. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the concepts, definitions, assessment tools, segmentation techniques and associated pitfalls, interpretation of those measurements on chest and abdomen CT, and a discussion of reported outcomes associated with body composition metrics in patients with early-stage and advanced lung cancer.

Other cardiometabolic outcomes remained unchanged after the 12-week trial period.In individuals with abdominal obesity, both endurance and resistance training reduced epicardial adipose tissue mass, while only resistance training reduced pericardial adipose tissue mass. These data highlight the potential preventive importance of different exercise modalities as means to reduce cardiac fat in individuals with abdominal obesity.</AbstractText>: In individuals with abdominal obesity, both endurance and resistance training reduced epicardial adipose tissue mass, while only resistance training reduced pericardial adipose tissue mass.

Regenerated organs are expected to solve the problem of donor-organ shortage in transplantation medicine. One approach to lung regeneration is to decellularize the organ and reseed it with selected cells. Advantage of the procedure includes reduced immunogenicity, since all cells can be theoretically replaced by autologous cells. However, little is known regarding the extracellular matrix (ECM) damage during decellularization and ECM reconstruction process in the organ regeneration. We aimed to evaluate ECM damage and reconstruction of the decellularized- recellularized rat lung, including the removal of alpha-gal xenoantigens. Rat lungs were perfused with sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100 via the pulmonary artery, after which the decellularized scaffold was reseeded with rat or human endothelial cells and adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). The ECM and alpha-gal antigen were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and a glycosaminoglycan assay. Alcian blue staining revealed increased production of proteoglycan following the addition of ASCs to the rat lung recellularized with rat lung microvascular endothelial cells. Glycosaminoglycan levels decreased in the decellularized lung and increased in the recellularized lung, especially in the ASC-treated group. Immunohistochemical expression of the alpha-gal protein was decreased to undetectable level in the decellularized lung tissue, and disappeared after recellularization with human cells. In western blot analysis, the bands of alpha-gal protein almost disappeared after recellularization with human cells. In conclusion, characteristics of the regenerated ECM might depend on the species and type of cells used for recellularization. Therefore, alpha-gal antigen might be eliminated after a prolonged culture, when using human cells.

AIM: Hepatocytes can proliferate and regenerate when injured by toxins, viral infections, and so on. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a key regulator of liver regeneration, but the mechanism is unknown. The role of ALR in other cell types is not known. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between microRNA (miRNA)-26a and ALR in the Huh7 cell line and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal cells from chronic liver disease patients and healthy individuals.METHODS: Huh7 cells were transfected independently with ALR and miRNA-26a expression vectors, and their effects on cell proliferation, the expression of miRNA-26a, and activation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog and Akt signaling pathways were determined. The experiments were repeated on mesenchymal stem cells derived from healthy individuals and chronic liver disease patients to see whether the observations can be replicated in primary cells.RESULTS: Overexpression of ALR or miRNA-26a resulted in an increase of the phosphorylation of Akt and cyclin D1 expression, whereas it resulted in decreased levels of p-GSK-3ß and phosphatase and tensin homolog in Huh7 cells. The inhibition of ALR expression by ALR siRNA or anti-miR-26a decreased the Akt/cyclin D1 signaling pathway, leading to decreased proliferation. Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the chronic liver disease patients had a higher ALR expression, while the mesenchymal stem cells isolated from healthy volunteers responded to the growth factor treatments for increased ALR expression. It was found that there was a significant increase in miRNA-26a expression and proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: These data clearly showed that ALR induced the expression of miRNA-26a, which downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog, resulting in an increased p-Akt/cyclin D1 pathway and enhanced proliferation in hepatic cells.

BACKGROUND: With the demand for stem cells in regenerative medicine, new methods of isolating stem cells are highly sought. Adipose tissue is a readily available and non-controversial source of multipotent stem cells that carries a low risk for potential donors. However, elevated donor body mass index has been associated with an altered cellular microenvironment and thus has implications for stem cell efficacy in recipients. This review explored the literature on adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and the effect of donor obesity on cellular function.METHODS: A review of published articles on obesity and ASCs was conducted with the PubMed database and the following search terms: obesity, overweight, adipose-derived stem cells and ASCs. Two investigators screened and reviewed the relevant abstracts.RESULTS: There is agreement on reduced ASC function in response to obesity in terms of angiogenic differentiation, proliferation, migration, viability, and an altered and inflammatory transcriptome. Osteogenic differentiation and cell yield do not show reasonable agreement. Weight loss partially rescues some of the aforementioned features.CONCLUSIONS: Generally, obesity reduces ASC qualities and may have an effect on the therapeutic value of ASCs. Because weight loss and some biomolecules have been shown to rescue these qualities, further research should be conducted on methods to return obese-derived ASCs to baseline.LEVEL V: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Ketosis is a major metabolic disorder of high-yielding dairy cows during the transition period. Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on 5 healthy and 5 ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum ß-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P &lt; 0.05 and fold changes &gt;1.5 or &lt;0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit a), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.

Adipocytes support key metabolic and endocrine functions of adipose tissue. Lipid is stored in two major classes of depots, namely visceral adipose (VA) and subcutaneous adipose (SA) depots. Increased visceral adiposity is associated with adverse health outcomes, whereas the impact of SA tissue is relatively metabolically benign. The precise molecular features associated with the functional differences between the adipose depots are still not well understood. Here, we characterised transcriptomes and methylomes of isolated adipocytes from matched SA and VA tissues of individuals with normal BMI to identify epigenetic differences and their contribution to cell type and depot-specific function. We found that DNA methylomes were notably distinct between different adipocyte depots and were associated with differential gene expression within pathways fundamental to adipocyte function. Most striking differential methylation was found at transcription factor and developmental genes. Our findings highlight the importance of developmental origins in the function of different fat depots.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified as a novel type of regulators involved in multiple biological processes. However, circRNAs with a potential function in fat deposition in buffalo are poorly understood. In this study, six RNA libraries of adipose tissue were constructed for three young and three adult Chinese buffaloes with paired-ends RNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform. A total of 5141 circRNAs were computationally identified. Among them, 252 circRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) between the young and adult buffaloes. Of these, 54 were upregulated and 198 were downregulated in the adult group. Eight DE circRNAs were further identified by quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Co-expression analysis revealed that 34 circRNAs demonstrated a strong correlation with fat deposition-associated genes (|r| &gt; 0.980). Among these, expressional correlation between two circRNAs (19:45387150|45389986 and 21:6969877|69753491) and PR/SET domain 16 was further verified using qRT-PCR, and a strong correlation was revealed (1 &gt; |r| &gt; 0.8). These results strongly suggest that circRNAs 19:45387150|45389986 and 21:6969877|69753491 are potential regulators of buffalo fat deposition. In summary, this study characterized the circRNA profiles of adipose tissues at different stages for the first time and revealed two circRNAs strongly correlated with fat deposition-associated genes, which provided new candidate regulators for fat deposition in buffalo.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have both rapidly increased during the last decades and are continuing to increase at an alarming rate worldwide. Obesity and impaired glucose homeostasis are closely related, and during the last decades of investigation about vitamin D, several clinical and epidemiological studies documented an inverse correlation between circulating vitamin D levels, central adiposity and the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. The insufficient sun exposure and outdoor activities of obese individuals, the storage of vitamin D in adipose tissue, because of its lipophilic properties, and the vitamin D-mediated modulation of adipogenesis, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and the immune system, are the main reasons for the close relationship between obesity, glucose homeostasis and hypovitaminosis D. Then objective of this review is to explore the pathophysiological mechanism(s) by which vitamin D modulates glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in obese individuals.

We report the effects of protein from different duck products on the intestinal flora and physiology of rats. After 30<U+202F>days of feeding, rats fed water-boiled salted duck protein had the lowest gut microbial diversity and richness. Allobaculum, Lactobacillus, Coprococcus and Eubacterium increased in rats fed wine-cured duck protein, while rats fed water-boiled salted and wine-cured duck protein showed increased serum urea (UREA) concentrations and serum cholesterol (CHOL) to HDL-cholesterol (HDLC) ratios, but decreased retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (rWAT) and perirenal white adipose tissue (pWAT) to body weight ratios. The changes in gut bacteria were mainly associated with the fat-mass index (weight of rWAT or pWAT to body weight ratio), accompanied by the opposite correlation with UREA content. SIGNIFICANCE: It showed that protein from different duck products impacted the intestinal flora and caused physiological changes in rats. Different sources of processed protein vary in their digestibility and digestive kinetics, all of which can affect the intestinal microbiota and physiology. We report the effects is an effort to map the complex interactions of &quot;host physiology-nutrition-microbiota&quot; in order to provide some insights into that food processing can be improved to promote beneficial gut microbes and enhance human health.

Resveratrol is a small molecule produced by various plants with a remarkable range of beneficial functions in animals. One of these is stimulating signaling pathways in adipose tissue that protect against obesity. Unfortunately, resveratrol suffers from poor bioavailability that inhibits its accumulation in target tissues, including fat, thus hindering the realization of its therapeutic potential. To address this, we are developing biodegradable microparticles as drug depots for controlled release of resveratrol within fat. In this study, resveratrol was encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles using an oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation technique. The oil phase consisted of resveratrol and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) dissolved in a mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol; meanwhile, the aqueous phase contained poly(vinyl alcohol) as the emulsifier. Increasing ethanol's volume ratio increased resveratrol's solubility in the oil phase and particle drug loading. The maximal loading achieved was 65<U+202F>µg/mg (6.5%) and occurred when the ethanol to dichloromethane ratio was 1:3. Under these conditions, particles exhibited ruffled surfaces, which resulted in variable drug release over the first three days of a six-week release assay. By decreasing resveratrol and ethanol in the oil phase and increasing poly(vinyl alcohol) in the aqueous phase, smooth particles were achieved, but they suffered a 15-25-fold decrease in drug loading depending on size. Small particles exhibited higher drug loading and burst drug release compared to larger particles because of their higher specific surface area. Utilizing mild chemistry, we functionalized poly(vinyl alcohol) with fluorescein isothiocyanate and demonstrated that encapsulation of resveratrol in the particle decreases the amount of fluorescent polymer on the particle surface, suggesting resveratrol displaces the emulsifier during particle formation. Taken together, resveratrol can be encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles, but it accumulates at the particle surface impacting drug loading, surface roughness, and drug release.

Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) causes various metabolic derangements. These include obesity and insulin resistance since inhibiting glucose utilization in adipose tissues is a major function of GC. Although adipose tissue distribution and glucose homeostasis are sex-dependently regulated, it has not been evaluated whether GC affects glucose metabolism and adipose tissue functions in a sex-dependent manner. In this study, high-dose corticosterone (rodent GC) treatment in C57BL/6J mice resulted in non-fasting hyperglycemia in male mice only while both sexes displayed hyperinsulinemia with normal fasting glucose levels, indicative for insulin resistance. Metabolic testing using stable isotope-labeled glucose techniques revealed a sex-specific corticosterone-driven glucose intolerance. Corticosterone treatment increased adipose tissue mass in both sexes, which was reflected by elevated serum leptin levels. However, female mice showed more metabolically protective adaptations of adipose tissues than male mice, demonstrated by higher serum total and high molecular weight adiponectin levels, more hyperplastic morphological changes, and a stronger increase in mRNA expression of adipogenic differentiation markers. Subsequently, in vitro studies in 3T3-L1 (white) and T37i (brown) adipocytes suggest that the increased leptin and adiponectin levels were mainly driven by the elevated insulin levels. In summary, this study demonstrates that GC-induced insulin resistance is more severe in male than in female mice, which can be partially explained by a sex-dependent adaptation of adipose tissues.

Adipose tissue expansion involves angiogenesis to remodel its capillary network. The enzymemethionine aminopeptidase 2(MetAP2) promotes angiogenesis.MetAP2 inhibitors suppress angiogenesis and have potential anti-obesity effect. However, impairment in adipose tissue expansion is also linked with impaired glycemic control.This study investigated the effect of BL6, a MetAP2 inhibitor, on adipogenesis and glucose disposal.To test effect on angiogenesis, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells(HUVECs) were treated with BL6 for 24h to determine tube formation. Further, to test effect on adipogenesis and glucose disposal,3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were treated with BL6(0 µM, 20µM, 50 µM or 100µM) during differentiation. Differentiated cells were stained with Oil Red O for determining lipid accumulation, and glucose uptake assay. Protein levels and RNA expression for key genes involved in the adipogenic cascade were determined.BL6 treatment of HUVECs dose dependently blocked angiogenesis. During differentiation of pre-adipocytes, 50µM and 100µM BL6 significantly reduced lipid accumulation. Treatment with 100µM BL6 significantly decreased expression of adipogenic genes. Interestingly, BL6 treatment dose dependently increased glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 cells.MetAP2 inhibitor blocks angiogenesis, attenuates adipogenesis, yet increases cellular glucose uptake. Collectively this proof of concept study supports a possible role for MetAP2 inhibitor BL6, as a putative anti-obesity therapeutic agent.

Insulin orchestrates metabolic homeostasis through a complex signaling network for which the precise mechanisms controlling its fine-tuning are not completely understood. Here, we report that Afadin, a scaffold protein, is phosphorylated on S1795 (S1718 in humans) in response to insulin in adipocytes, and this phosphorylation is impaired with obesity and insulin resistance. In turn, loss of Afadin enhances the response to insulin in adipose tissues via upregulation of the insulin receptor protein levels. This happens in a cell-autonomous and phosphorylation-dependent manner. Insulin-stimulated Afadin-S1795 phosphorylation modulates Afadin binding with interaction partners in adipocytes, among which HDAC6 preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Afadin and acts as a key intermediate to suppress insulin receptor protein levels. Adipose tissue-specific Afadin depletion protects against insulin resistance and improves glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese mice, independently of adiposity. Altogether, we uncover a novel insulin-induced cellular feedback mechanism governed by the interaction of Afadin with HDAC6 to negatively control insulin action in adipocytes, which may offer new strategies to alleviate insulin resistance.

Nowadays, adipose tissue appears to be the most valuable source in regenerative cell therapy, due to the following characteristics: high accessibility, high expression in a large number of individuals, high self-renewal and ability to differentiate, and hematopoietic support to the implant area. Its therapeutic potential has been experimentally observed in a broad spectrum of diseases with high population impact: diabetes, myocardial infarction, Parkinson disease, bone fractures, facial reconstruction or loss of subcutaneous tissue due to congenital abnormalities (e.g., hemifacial microsomy), trauma, burns, and tumors. Over 130 clinical trials using adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), majority phase I or phase II, have been registered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and in the short term no adverse reactions or significant risks were identified. Parallel with regulatory frameworks that control their safety and assess their efficacy, phase III trials are being developed. Although transplantation with adipose tissue is becoming more and more popular, there are still important drawbacks and technical challenges to be addressed, and clinical strategies to be developed. This review explores in a concise manner the present body of knowledge concerning ASCs and their implication in therapy.

The posterolateral hip approach is the oldest and most used way to implant total hip arthroplasty. The anterior part of the oblique portion of this posterolateral approach corresponds more or less to the superolateral quadrant of the buttock in which the intramuscular injection of various drugs, including the compounds derived from artemisinin, is carried out. Thus, in a malarial endemic area where gluteal injections of the compounds derived from artemisinin are not rare, poor performance of an injection by the deposition of the product in the fat and not deeply in the muscle can be at the origin of the sequestration of the drug in adipose tissue and give the macroscopic appearance of a pus. The authors present a case of intrafat sequestration of artemisinin taken for purulent collection during a posterolateral hip approach for total hip arthroplasty.

Adipocytes function as an energy buffer and undergo significant size and volume changes in response to nutritional cues. This adipocyte plasticity is important for systemic lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Accompanying the adipocyte size and volume changes, the mechanical pressure against cell membrane also changes. However, the role that mechanical pressure plays in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity remains to be elucidated. Here we show that Piezo1, a mechanically-activated cation channel stimulated by membrane tension and stretch, was highly expressed in adipocytes. Adipose Piezo1 expression was increased in obese mice. Adipose-specific piezo1 knockout mice (adipose-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup>) developed insulin resistance, especially when challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD). Perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) weight was reduced while pro-inflammatory and lipolysis genes were increased in the pgWAT of HFD-fed adipose-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The adipose-Piezo1<sup>-/-</sup> mice also developed hepatic steatosis with elevated expression of fatty acid synthesis genes. In cultured adipocytes, Piezo1 activation decreased, while Piezo1 inhibition elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression. TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 abolished adipocyte inflammation induced by Piezo1 inhibition. Thus, adipose Piezo1 may serve as an adaptive mechanism for adipocyte plasticity restraining pro-inflammatory response in obesity.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have indicated that the plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) affects lipid accumulation; however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We aim to clarify the effect of DEHP on lipid metabolism and the role of TYK2/STAT1 and autophagy.METHODS: In total, 160 Wistar rats were exposed to DEHP [0, 5, 50, 500 mg/(kgd)] for 8 weeks. Lipid levels, as well as mRNA and protein levels of TYK2, STAT1, PPAR<U+03B3>, AOX, FAS, LPL, and LC3 were detected.RESULTS: The results indicate that DEHP exposure may lead to increased weight gain and altered serum lipids. We observed that DEHP exposure affected liver parenchyma and increased the volume or number of fat cells. In adipose tissue, decreased TYK2 and STAT1 promoted the expression of PPAR<U+03B3> and FAS. The mRNA and protein expression of LC3 in 50 and 500 mg/(kgd) groups was increased significantly. In the liver, TYK2 and STAT1 increased compensatorily; however, the expression of FAS and AOX increased, while LPL expression decreased. Joint exposure to both a high-fat diet and DEHP led to complete disorder of lipid metabolism.CONCLUSION: It is suggested that DEHP induces lipid metabolism disorder by regulating TYK2/STAT1. Autophagy may play a potential role in this process as well. High-fat diet, in combination with DEHP exposure, may jointly have an effect on lipid metabolism disorder.

BACKGROUND: ICU-acquired weakness is a debilitating consequence of prolonged critical illness that is associated with poor outcome. Recently, premorbid obesity has been shown to protect against such illness-induced muscle wasting and weakness. Here, we hypothesized that this protection was due to increased lipid and ketone availability.METHODS: In a centrally catheterized, fluid-resuscitated, antibiotic-treated mouse model of prolonged sepsis, we compared markers of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in lean and obese septic mice (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>117). Next, we compared markers of muscle wasting and weakness in septic obese wild-type and adipose tissue-specific ATGL knockout (AAKO) mice (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>73), in lean septic mice receiving either intravenous infusion of lipids or standard parenteral nutrition (PN) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>70), and in lean septic mice receiving standard PN supplemented with either the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate or isocaloric glucose (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>49).RESULTS: Obese septic mice had more pronounced lipolysis (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05), peripheral fatty acid oxidation (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05), and ketogenesis (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) than lean mice. Blocking lipolysis in obese septic mice caused severely reduced muscle mass (32% loss vs. 15% in wild-type, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and specific maximal muscle force (59% loss vs. 0% in wild-type; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). In contrast, intravenous infusion of lipids in lean septic mice maintained specific maximal muscle force up to healthy control levels (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6), whereas this was reduced with 28% in septic mice receiving standard PN (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006). Muscle mass was evenly reduced with 29% in both lean septic groups (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Lipid administration enhanced fatty acid oxidation (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) and ketogenesis (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), but caused unfavorable liver steatosis (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01) and a deranged lipid profile (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01). Supplementation of standard PN with 3-hydroxybutyrate also attenuated specific maximal muscle force up to healthy control levels (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1), but loss of muscle mass could not be prevented (25% loss in both septic groups; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Importantly, this intervention improved muscle regeneration markers (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05) without the unfavorable side effects seen with lipid infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity-induced muscle protection during sepsis is partly mediated by elevated mobilization and metabolism of endogenous fatty acids. Furthermore, increased availability of ketone bodies, either through ketogenesis or through parenteral infusion, appears to protect against sepsis-induced muscle weakness also in the lean.

BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) are one of the most potent adult stem cells, capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage, adipose, muscle, and others. An innovative autologous AT-MSC-derived cell-based product (BonoFill-II) for bone tissue regeneration was developed to be suited as a bone graft for segmental bone defects.METHODS: BonoFill-II was transplanted into 8 sheep with 3.2-cm full cortex segmental defect formed in the tibia. Bone regeneration was followed by X-ray radiographs for 12<U+2009>weeks. At experiment termination, the healed tibia bones were analyzed by computed tomography, histology, and mechanical tests.RESULTS: Our results indicate that one dose of BonoFill-II injectable formula led to an extensive bone growth within the transplantation site and to a complete closure of the critical gap in the sheep's tibia in a relatively short time (8-12<U+2009>weeks), with no inflammation and no other signs of graft rejection. This new and innovative product opens new prospects for the treatment of long bone defects.CONCLUSIONS: Injection of BonoFill-II (an innovative autologous cell therapy product for bone tissue regeneration) into a critical size segmental defect model (3.2<U+2009>cm), generated in the sheep tibia, achieved full bridging of the gap in an extremely short period (8-12<U+2009>weeks).

Obesity is characterized by chronic and low-grade systemic inflammation, an increase of adipose tissue, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia of adipocytes. Adipose tissues can be classified into white, brown, beige and pink adipose tissues, which display different regulatory, morphological and functional characteristics of their adipocyte and immune cells. Brown and white adipocytes can play a key role not only in the control of energy homeostasis, or through the balance between energy storage and expenditure, but also by the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, brown and white adipocytes can orchestrate important immunological crosstalk that may deeply impact the tumor microenvironment and be crucial for cancer establishment and progression. Recent works have indicated that white adipose tissues can undergo a process called browning, in which an inducible brown adipocyte develops. In this review, we depict the mechanisms involved in the differential role of brown, white and pink adipocytes, highlighting their structural, morphological, regulatory and functional characteristics and correlation with cancer predisposition, establishment, and progression. We also discuss the impact of the increased adiposity in the inflammatory and immunological modulation. Moreover, we focused on the plasticity of adipocytes, describing the molecules produced and secreted by those cells, the modulation of the signaling pathways involved in the browning phenomena of white adipose tissue and its impact on inflammation and cancer.

BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II (Ang II), released by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), contributes to the modulatory role of the RAAS in adipose tissue dysfunction. Investigators have shown that inhibition of AngII improved adipose tissue function and insulin resistance in mice with metabolic syndrome. Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a potent antioxidant, has been demonstrated to improve oxidative stress and adipocyte phenotype. Molecular effects of high oxidative stress include suppression of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), which is amenable to redox manipulations. The mechanisms involved, however, in these metabolic effects of the RAAS remain incompletely understood.HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that AngII-induced oxidative stress has the potential to suppress adipocyte SIRT1 via down regulation of HO-1. This effect of AngII will, in turn, upregulate mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). The induction of HO-1 will rescue SIRT1, hence improving oxidative stress and adipocyte phenotype.METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the effect of AngII on lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines in mouse pre-adipocytes in the presence and absence of cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), HO-1 inducer, tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP), and HO-1 inhibitor. Our results show that treatment of mouse pre-adipocytes with AngII increased lipid accumulation, superoxide levels, inflammatory cytokine levels, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), and adiponectin levels. This effect was attenuated by HO-1 induction, which was further reversed by SnMP, suggesting HO-1 mediated improvement in adipocyte phenotype. AngII-treated pre-adipocytes also showed upregulated levels of MR and suppressed SIRT1 that was rescued by HO-1. Subsequent treatment with CoPP and SIRT1 siRNA in mouse pre-adipocytes increased lipid accumulation and fatty acid synthase (FAS) levels, suggesting that beneficial effects of HO-1 are mediated via SIRT1.CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates for the first time that HO-1 has the ability to restore cellular redox, rescue SIRT1, and prevent AngII-induced impaired effects on adipocytes and the systemic metabolic profile.

In the presence of dietary lipids, both apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV) production and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis are increased. The effect of dietary lipid-induced AproA-IV on BAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that ApoA-IV knockout (ApoA-IV-KO) mice exhibited decreased BAT thermogenesis to affect energy homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, BAT thermogenesis in wildtype (WT) and ApoA-IV-KO mice fed either a standard low-fat chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) was investigated. When fed a chow diet, energy expenditure and food intake were comparable between WT and ApoA-IV-KO mice. After 1 week of HFD consumption, ApoA-IV-KO mice had comparable energy intake but produced lower energy expenditure relative to their WT controls in the dark phase. After an acute feeding of dietary lipids or 1-week HFD feeding, ApoA-IV-KO mice produced lower levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and exhibited reduced expression of thermogenic genes in the BAT compared with WT controls. In response to cold exposure, however, ApoA-IV-KO mice had comparable energy expenditure and BAT temperature relative to WT mice. Thus, ApoA-IV-KO mice exhibited reduced diet-induced BAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure.

The aim of this study was to report the experience and long-term efficacy of a novel surgical treatment for pelvic lipomatosis (PL) using a combination of pelvic fat mass extirpation and ureteral reimplantation.Data of 8 patients with PL who underwent pelvic fat mass extirpation and ureteral reimplantation at our hospital from September 2010 to March 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, serum creatinine level, radiographic changes, perioperative complications, and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated.Surgeries were performed successfully without severe perioperative complications in all 8 patients. Median operating time was 150 minutes with a median estimated blood loss of 75<U+200A>mL. Patients were discharged after a median of 8.5 postoperative days. Imaging studies at the first follow-up revealed varying extents of alleviation of hydronephrosis and 3 patients' urinary symptoms were gradually relieved after surgery. During a median follow-up of 48.5 months (range, 10-100 months), all patients exhibited excellent surgical outcomes without evidence of disease progression, except 1 patient who underwent radical cystectomy with Bricker ileal conduit surgery due to hydronephrosis recurrence in the 49th postoperative month.Based on these cases, pelvic fat mass extirpation and ureteral reimplantation is a safe and effective surgical treatment for PL.

INTRODUCTION: A progressive decline in lean body mass and increase in fat mass occur with aging, and result in progressive weakness and impaired mobility; these features are altogether landmarks of the ageing frailty syndrome. High-fat mass and low muscle mass are both associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and are supposed to be risk factors for arterial stiffness. Little data analyzing the relationship between body composition and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) are currently available. The main objective of this study was to verify whether low muscle mass and/or high fat mass could be associated with arterial stiffness measured by CAVI.METHODS: Data are from the cross-sectional assessment of the &quot;Al passo con la tua salute&quot;, a clinical study aimed to promote physical function among free-living elderly subjects.After a screening interview and a clinical visit aimed to exclude ineligible persons, 52 volunteers were enrolled in the study. All underwent: clinical examination, physical performance assessment, an interview on lifestyle and dietary habits, and lastly, a blood sample collection after at least 8 hours of fasting.RESULTS: CAVI was statistically significantly higher in those participants in the highest tertile of distribution for fat mass compared to all other subjects (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.03). In those participants in the lowest tertile of distribution of muscle mass, compared to all other, CAVI was also statistically significant higher (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.01) independently of age, sex, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.CONCLUSIONS: Low muscle mass and high fat mass were landmarks in the frailty model of aging; therefore, it is not inconsistent that both clinical conditions might share with the &quot;aging vessel&quot; a common pathway, probably mediated through signaling network deregulation and/or through alteration of the balance between energy availability and energy demand.

Over the last decades, the onset of puberty in girls has occurred earlier, but the tempo of pubertal progression has been relatively slower, resulting in a younger age at puberty onset without a change in age at menarche. Sufficient energy availability and adiposity contribute to early pubertal development, and environmental factors, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may affect not only the control of energy balance, but also puberty and reproduction. EDCs are hormonally active substances that can perturb puberty by acting both peripherally on target organs, such as adipose tissue or adrenal glands, and/or centrally on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Depending on whether the exposure takes place earlier during fetal and neonatal life or later during early childhood, EDCs can lead to different outcomes through different mechanisms. Evidence of associations between exposures to EDCs and altered pubertal timing makes it reasonable to support their relationship. However, human epidemiologic data are limited or inconsistent and cannot provide sufficient evidence for a causal relationship between EDC exposure and changes in pubertal timing. Further investigation is warranted to determine the overall or different effects of EDCs exposure during prenatal or childhood windows on pubertal milestones and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, including epigenetic marks, whereby early-life exposure to EDCs affect the HPG-peripheral tissue axis.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) has been proven to be able to visualize pathological lymphatic networks and accompanying complications through subcutaneous injection of commonly used contrast agents. However, no comprehensive prior studies have previously been reported regarding MRL for the evaluation of upper extremity lymphedema in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). In this study, we establish a novel MRL protocol to characterize the normal and abnormal characteristics of different clinical stages of BCRL in patients using high-spatial-resolution MRL.METHODS: Fifty females with unilateral upper extremity BCRL underwent MRL. Lymphatic vessel morphology in normal and affected limbs was compared. The appearance, distribution pattern, morphologic characteristics, and maximum transversal diameter of the lymphatic vessels, dermal backflow, and regeneration of lymphatic vessels were analyzed.RESULTS: Lymph fluid was retained in the subcutis of the affected limbs, and no edema was observed in the subfascial compartment. In stage 1, tortuous and dilated lymphatic vessels exhibited a beaded appearance, and their diameters were larger than those in the contralateral forearm (P &lt; 0.05). In stage 2, the dilated lymphatic vessels exhibited larger diameters. &quot;Dermal backflow&quot; and tiny regenerated lymphatic vessels appeared. The thickened subcutaneous tissue showed a honeycomb pattern induced by soft tissue fibrosis and adipose hypertrophy. In stage 3, disordered and unrecognizable affected lymphatic vessels were observed with many small regenerated lymphatics and confluent dermal backflow; the tissue fibrosis was more serious.CONCLUSIONS: Each stage presents different characteristics, and the deformity degree of the lymphatic network is consistent with the severity of the disease. Magnetic resonance lymphangiography could provide adequate information for clinical staging in patients with BCRL.

In the field of wound healing, stem cell-based strategies are gaining importance for their regenerative potential. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a particular subset of mesenchymal stem cells present in the stromal-vascular fraction of the adipose tissue, today considered very attractive for their relative abundance and accessibility in the human body. However, ADSCs are still not routinely used in normal clinical practice. Several studies have also reported ADSC transplantation in association with biomaterials in an attempt to enhance the local retention and growth rate of the cells. The aim of our study was to evaluate the ability of ADSCs to build a dermal scaffold to be potentially used as a dermal substitute in the field of wound healing, with optimal biocompatibility and mechanical properties. ADSCs were defined as CD90-, CD73-, and CD105-positive cells. ADSCs turned out to be capable of secreting all the main components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) upon stimulation, thus efficiently producing a collagen and fibronectin-containing dermal matrix. We also checked whether the ADSC-produced dermal scaffold could be seeded with keratinocytes. The scaffolding material directly produced by ADSCs has several advantages when compared to the commercially available ones: it is easily obtained from the patients and it is 100% biocompatible and supports cell-ECM interaction. Moreover, it represents a possible powerful therapeutic tool for patients with chronic ulcers since it appears to be potentially grafted with keratinocytes layers, thus bypassing the classical two-step grafting procedure.

Underlying metabolic disease is poor adipose tissue function characterized by impaired glucose tolerance and low expression of health promoting adipokines. Currently, no treatments specifically target the adipose tissue and we are investigating polymer scaffolds for localized drug delivery as a therapeutic platform. In this work we implanted porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) scaffolds into the epididymal fat of mice. Surprisingly, &quot;empty&quot; scaffolds decreased blood glucose levels in healthy mice as well as epididymal fat pad size. By injecting a fluorescent glucose tracer into mice, we determined that glucose uptake increases by 60% in epididymal fat pads with scaffolds; in contrast, glucose uptake was not elevated in other major metabolic organs, suggesting the enhanced glucose uptake at the scaffold implant site was responsible for decreased blood glucose levels. Histology indicated increased cellularity and tissue remodeling around the scaffold and we found increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1, which are proteins involved in wound healing that can also modulate blood glucose levels through their promotion of glucose uptake. Regarding clinical translation, &quot;empty&quot; scaffolds decreased obesity and improved glucose tolerance in mice fed a high fat diet. These findings demonstrate increased cellular activity in the adipose tissue, such as that associated with the host response to biomaterial implant, is beneficial in mice suffering from metabolic complications of over nutrition, possibly because it mitigates the positive energy balance that leads to the obese, diabetic state. More broadly, this work reaffirms that in addition to the local host response typically investigated, biomaterial implant has systemic physiological effects and suggests that there may be implications for therapy.

BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoid (GC) excess increases lipolysis, circulating free fatty acid concentrations and lipid oxidation rates in humans. In vitro and animal studies have shown that GCs increase adipocyte ATGL and HSL mRNA contents and HSL phosphorylations, but the effects of GC on in vivo lipase signaling in humans are uncertain. Our study was designed to test how GC administration affects ATGL and HSL related signals in human adipose tissue.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nine healthy young men underwent 5<U+202F>days administration of 37.5<U+202F>mg prednisolone/d in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design. At the end of each 5 d period the subjects were studied after an overnight fast for 6.5<U+202F>h including a basal period and a 2½<U+202F>h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Adipose tissue biopsies were sampled from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue at the end of the basal period and the clamp.CONCLUSIONS: High dose GC administration to humans leads to pro-lipolytic alterations of CGI-58, G0S2 and ANGPTL4 mRNA transcripts, increases PKA signaling to lipolysis and inhibits the insulin signal in adipose tissue. The increased CIDE-A and CIDE-C mRNA levels suggest concomitant stimulation of lipolysis and lipid storage.

The attachments of jaw muscles are typically implicated in the evolution and shape of the dorsotemporal fenestra on the skull roof of amniotes. However, the dorsotemporal fenestrae of many archosaurian reptiles possess smooth excavations rostral and dorsal to the dorsotemporal fossa which closely neighbors the dorsotemporal fenestra and jaw muscle attachments. Previous research has typically identified this region, here termed the frontoparietal fossa, to also have attachment surfaces for jaw-closing muscles. However, numerous observations of extant and extinct archosaurs described here suggest that other tissues are instead responsible for the size and shape of the frontoparietal fossa. This study reviewed the anatomical evidence that support soft-tissue hypotheses of the frontoparietal fossa and its phylogenetic distribution among sauropsids. Soft-tissue hypotheses (i.e., muscle, pneumatic sinus, vascular tissues) were analyzed using anatomical, imaging and in vivo thermography techniques within a phylogenetic framework using extant and extinct taxa to determine the inferential power underlying the reconstruction of the soft tissues in the skull roofs of dinosaurs, pseudosuchians, and other reptiles. Relevant anatomical features argue for rejection of the default hypothesis-that the fossa was muscular-due to a complete lack of osteological correlates reflective of muscle attachment. The most-supported inference of soft tissues is that the frontoparietal fossa contained a large vascular structure and adipose tissue. Despite the large sizes and diverse morphologies of these fossae found among dinosaur taxa, these data suggest that non-avian dinosaurs had the anatomical foundation to support physiologically significant vascular devices and/or vascular integumentary structures on their skull roofs.

Obesity-related diseases are an important part of public health; and obesity is related with colorectal cancer. Adipocyte hypertrophy and visceral adipose tissue accumulation can cause adipocitis-related diseases and pathogenic adipocyte formation. Adipose tissue has a very important and active role in immune response formation. Cytokines/adipokines, which are secreted from adipose tissue, have an active role in communication between adipocytes and macrophages. Thus, visceral adipocyte is related with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation. Adipocytes have an important role in colorectal cancer pathogenesis because of proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and hormones secretion. Most highlighted cytokines are adiponectin, resistin, and ghrelin. Also, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, increased plasma insulin levels, body mass index, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), glucose, and serum free fatty acids levels are considered to be related with colorectal cancer pathogenesis. Thus, in this review, we focus on the role of adipokines and insulin in colorectal cancer.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the features of expression and adiponectin content in the adipocyte culture of subcutaneous, epicardial, and perivascular adipose tissue and the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin on these processes. 29 patients with coronary artery disease were examined. Adipocytes were isolated from the samples of SAT, EAT and PVAT which were taken during coronary artery bypass surgery, followed by cultivation in the presence of rosuvastatin and evaluation of gene expression and adiponectin concentration. Adipocytes SAT, EAT and PVAT differed in the level of adiponectin secretion and expression of its gene. On day 1 of cultivation the expression of the adiponectin gene in the EAT was 2.3 times lower than in the PVAT. On day 2 of cultivation the expression of the adiponectin gene was reduced both in the EAT and the PVAT as compared to the SAT. When rosuvastatin was added at a concentration of 1 mmol/L, adiponectin gene expression in PVAT was higher than when rosuvastatin was added at a concentration of 5 mmol/L, in the adipocyte culture of SAT effect was opposite. Thus, the adipocytes of EZhT and, to a greater extent, PAS, can be a therapeutic target for statins in the case of the pathological activation of adipose tissue.Issledovali osobennosti ékspressii i soderzhaniia adiponektina v kul'ture adipotsitov podkozhnoi, épikardial'noi i perivaskuliarnoi zhirovoi tkani i vliianie na éti protsessy razlichnykh doz rozuvastatina.

BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is suggested to be associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness is used in prediction of atherosclerotic risk. The aim of our study was to evaluate EAT thickness in FMF patients for early detection of risk of atherosclerosis and to be compared with its level in healthy controls.METHODS: Thirty 6- to 18-year-old children with FMF and 30 age- and sex-matched children (control group) were included in the study. Disease characteristics, disease severity and Mediterranean fever gene mutations were recorded. EAT thicknesses was measured by echocardiography.RESULTS: EAT in patients' group was significantly greater than that of controls (5.21<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.3 vs. 2.81<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.96<U+2009>mm, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) and was correlated with cholesterol level and platelets count (p = 0.047 and 0.018, respectively).CONCLUSION: This study concluded that EAT thickness was statistically increased in FMF patients than controls with a positive correlation with cholesterol level and platelet count. This finding suggests a higher risk for atherosclerosis in these patients. Follow-up study is needed to verify the effect of treatment of FMF on the EAT thickness. Further studies with larger number of patients following-up EAT are needed to verify this finding.

Ectopic hamartomatous thymoma (EHT) is a rare benign neoplasm classically occurring in the lower neck of adult males. Here we present a case of EHT occurring in a 43-year-old immunocompromised male and a brief review of existing literature. The patient presented with a palpable mass overlying the left clavicle which, on imaging, showed a solitary nodule possibly eroding the cortical bone. A biopsy predominantly showed spindle cells that were immunopositive for keratin AE1/AE3 as well as weakly positive for CD99, SMA, and CD34. A diagnosis of synovial sarcoma was favored; at which point surgical resection was performed. The resected mass was well-demarcated with a tan-yellow cut surface. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of a mixture of spindle cells, glands, and mature adipose tissue. The spindle cells were plump with bland nuclei, and the epithelial component showed morphology similar to glands of salivary or breast tissue with a bilayered appearance (luminal and basal). No pleomorphism, mitotic figures, or necrosis was present. Immunohistochemical stains were performed and showed the spindle cells to express a myoepithelial phenotype (cytokeratin AE1/AE3, p63, calponin positive). The glands showed SMA and p63 positivity in the basal cells (similar to salivary gland and breast). Overall, given the clinical context, histomorphologic, and immunohistochemical profile, a diagnosis of EHT was made. At 12 months of follow-up there was no evidence of recurrence.

Immune cells residing in white adipose tissue have been highlighted as important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, but the molecular regulators that drive adipose tissue immune cell remodeling during obesity remain largely unknown. Using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all adipose tissue immune populations in both mice and humans during obesity. We describe a novel and conserved Trem2<sup>+</sup> lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subset and identify markers, spatial localization, origin, and functional pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice globally inhibits the downstream molecular LAM program, leading to adipocyte hypertrophy as well as systemic hypercholesterolemia, body fat accumulation, and glucose intolerance. These findings identify Trem2 signaling as a major pathway by which macrophages respond to loss of tissue-level lipid homeostasis, highlighting Trem2 as a key sensor of metabolic pathologies across multiple tissues and a potential therapeutic target in metabolic diseases.

Telomeres are structures located at the ends of chromosomes associated with proteins, from the shelterin complex, which are responsible for the protection and preservation of the genetic material. The telomere length (TL) progressively decreases with each cell division, and recent evidence suggests that lifestyle can lead to telomere shortening. In individuals with obesity, excess adipose tissue plays a key role in inducing a chronic and systemic inflammatory state, which can cause TL shortening. Thus, the aim of the present review was to show the relationship between obesity and TL in addition to the possible risk factors for its shortening and how the different strategies for weight loss can modulate TL. As the crucial result, we can consider the association between TL and weight loss and adiposity changes after different interventions, showing that TL may be used as a biomarker of responses to obesity treatment.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: It has not been elucidated if an energy-restricted diet with high protein content could induce a benefit in insulin resistance in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM); and if an adipose tissue functionality improvement could mediate this effect. We aimed to assess the effect of energy-restricted diets with standard (18% from total calories; SP) vs high (35%) protein (HP), mainly coming from lean animal source, composition on glucose metabolism and adipokine concentration in overweight and obese subjects with T2DM. HOMA-IR change was the primary outcome.METHODS: Six-month weight-loss intervention including 73 subjects (43.8% men, 55.6 ± 8.37 aged and 32.8 ± 3.67 of BMI) with T2DM that were randomized to follow one of two calorie-restricted diets with the following distribution of calories: 18% (0.75 [95%CI: 0.71-0.78] g/kg/day) protein, 52% carbohydrates and 30% fat, or 35% (1.34 [95%CI: 1.27-1.41] g/kg/day) protein, 35% carbohydrates, and 30% fat. Anthropometric, clinical, biochemical (involving leptin, RBP4 and adiponectin) and lifestyle assessments were performed.RESULTS: Sixty-seven participants completed the study. Weight loss homogenously decreased among diets. HOMA-IR in HP diminished 2-fold than in SP diet (P = 0.023 and P = 0.004 at 3 and 6-months between diets). Participants following HP diet showed higher decrease in insulin, in glucose at 6-months (P = 0.004) and in HbA1c at 3-months (P = 0.003). RBP4 and leptin significantly decreased in both diets although no differences were found between diets. Adiponectin increased by 6.05% and 29.9% at 3-months in SP and HP diets, respectively (P = 0.167), and 23.7% and 53.5% at 6-months in SP and HP diets (P = 0.219). Adiponectin variation was inversely correlated with HbA1c, insulin and HOMA-IR changes at 6-months.CONCLUSIONS: An energy-restricted diet containing 35% of total calories coming from protein lead to a greater improvement in glucose homeostasis, indicated by HOMA-IR and fasting plasma insulin concentrations, irrespective of weight loss in subjects with prediabetes or early stages of T2DM. This effect cannot be explained by changes in plasma concentration of adipokines.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02559479).

BACKGROUND: The prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients can be influenced by genetic mutations and nutritional status. The relationship between these variables is unclear. The objective of the study was to verify the variables involved in the nutritional status and genetic mutations, which correlate with survival of CRC patients.METHODS: Patients with surgical intervention for tumor resection were evaluated using body mass index, nutritional screening, patient self-produced global subjective assessment, phase angle, and computed tomography to calculate the areas of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and muscle mass for the determination of sarcopenia. Ten gene mutations involved in CRC carcinogenesis were studied (PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF, EGFR, NRAS, TP53, APC, PTEN, SMAD4, and FBXW7). DNA was extracted from fresh tumor or paraffin tissues.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with positive indicators for malnutrition or risk of malnutrition had an increased risk of death. No relationship was identified between the presence of mutations and survival.

Excessive adiposity in an obese state is known to drive the onset of metabolic dysregulations, mostly involving chronic immune activation and oxidative stress. Prolonged inflammation and oxidative stress have been linked to impaired adipose tissue function and the development of the metabolic syndrome. Currently available therapies offer minimal prophylactic effects, while substantial experimental evidence supports the ameliorative effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against various metabolic complications associated with obesity. The current review provides a comprehensive synthesis of studies published in major search engines such as PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and Google Scholar assessing the therapeutic effect of NAC against obesity associated complications. Overwhelming literature included in this review supports the ameliorative effects of NAC against such complications in both in vitro and in vivo models of obesity. In addition to attenuating an abnormal pro-inflammatory response and limiting oxidative damage, NAC could inhibit lipid accumulation by targeting adipogenic transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPß), and improve insulin sensitivity through augmenting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. Although necessary evidence informing on its optimal dose and its comparative effect with other well-studied pharmacological compounds is demonstrated, it is clear that future investigations are required to confirm the therapeutic effect of NAC in obese human subjects.

Breast cancer (BC) metastasis after surgery is associated with the tumor microenvironment and especially with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) that have been shown to promote the BC progression. To better understand the role of ASCs in tumor metastasis, our study explored a novel mechanism that mediates the negative regulation of miR20b during ASC-induced tumor metastasis of BC cells. In this study, we found that the migration and invasion abilities of BC cells are markedly increased coculture with ASCs. By studying the regulatory mechanism, we found that miR20b biogenesis in BC cells can be attenuated by ASC-released stem cell factor (SCF) through the downstream c-Kit/MAPK-p38/E2F1 signaling cascade and that miR-20b acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA in the inhibition of BC migration and invasion. HIF-1a and VEGFA are the target genes of miR20b and miR20b downregulation activated HIF-1a-mediated VEGFA transcription and ASC-induced BC migration and invasion. The upregulation of miR20b abrogated the activation of EMT and lung metastasis of breast cancer cells cocultured with ASCs by the inhibition of N-cadherin, vimentin and Twist expression in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings indicate that downregulation of miR20b by ASCs/SCF activates HIF-1a/VEGFA and induces BC cell EMT and metastasis, suggesting that this process is activated by the p-c-Kit/MAPK-p38/E2F1 pathway.

AIMS: Although anabolic steroids (AS) and trans-fatty acids overload exerts systemic toxicity and are independent risk factors for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, their interaction remains poorly understood. Thus, we investigated the impact of a diet rich in trans-fatty acids (HFD) combined with AS on glycemic control, lipid profile, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and pancreas microstructure and expression of genes involved in energy metabolism.MAIN METHODS: Forty-eight C57BL/6 mice were randomized into 6 groups treated for 12<U+202F>weeks with a standard diet (SD) or a diet rich in C18:1 trans-fatty isomers (HFD), alone or combined with 10 or 20<U+202F>mg/kg testosterone cypionate (AS).KEY FINDINGS: Our results indicated that AS improved glycemic control, upregulated gene expression of Glut-4 and CPT-1 in skeletal muscle, FAS, ACC and UCP-1 in adipose tissue. AS also reduced total and LDL cholesterol in mice fed a SD. When combined with the HFD, AS was unable to induce microstructural adaptations in adipose tissue, pancreatic islets and ß-cells, but potentiated GCK and Glut-2 (pancreas) and Glut-4 and CPT-1 (skeletal muscle) upregulation. HFD plus AS also downregulated FAS and ACC gene expression in adipose tissue. Combined with HFD, AS increased triacylglycerol circulating levels, improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in mice.SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicated that HFD and AS can interact to modulates glycemic control and lipid profile by a mechanism potentially related with a reprogramming of genes expression in organs such as the pancreas, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal adiposity is a cardiovascular risk factor; it is assumed that the combination of radiofrequency and physical exercise may decrease this excess of adipose tissue.PURPOSE: To understand whether an aerobic physical exercise session associated with abdominal radiofrequency increases the level of lipolytic activity.METHODOLOGY: The study analyzes the effect of a combined aerobic exercise session with radiofrequency. Participants were 30 healthy female volunteers, aged 18-28 years, randomly assigned to an experimental group and placebo group. They were characterized by a sociodemographic questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Food Frequency Questionnaire. The groups performed an abdominal radiofrequency session followed by moderate aerobic exercise, assessing glycerol concentration and lipid profile values before and after the intervention. In the experimental group, a percentage of potency was used that allowed to maintain the temperature between 40º C and 42º C to the epidermis. In the placebo group, the power of the radiofrequency was 0 Watt. To compare results, Student's t test was used for a significance level of 0.05.RESULTS: There were no significant changes in glycerol concentrations between groups (P &gt; 0.05). There were no changes in the lipid profile of both groups after the intervention (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: The association of exercise with radiofrequency did not present an increased effect on lipolytic activity when compared to the isolated exercise. The application of this technique is a safe intervention.

We examined the effects of VEGFA on damage and regeneration in steatotic and non-steatotic livers of rats submitted to PH under I/R, and characterized the underlying mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that VEGFA levels were decreased in both steatotic and non-steatotic livers after surgery. The administration of VEGFA increased VEGFA levels in non-steatotic livers, reducing the incidence of post-operative complications following surgery through the VEGFR2-Wnt2 pathway, independently of Id1. Unexpectedly, administration of VEGFA notably reduced VEGFA levels in steatotic livers, exacerbating damage and regenerative failure. After exogenous administration of VEGFA in steatotic animals, circulating VEGFA is sequestered by the high circulating levels of sFlt1 released from adipose tissue. Under such conditions, VEGFA cannot reach the steatotic liver to exert its effects. Consequently, the concomitant administration of VEGFA and an antibody against sFlt1 was required to avoid binding of sFlt1 to VEGFA. This was associated with high VEGFA levels in steatotic livers and protection against damage and regenerative failure, plus improvement in the survival rate via up-regulation of PI3K/Akt independently of the Id1-Wnt2 pathway. The current study highlights the different effects and signaling pathways of VEGFA in liver surgery requiring PH and I/R based in the presence of steatosis. KEY MESSAGES: VEGFA administration improves PH+I/R injury only in non-steatotic livers of Ln animals. VEGFA benefits are exerted through the VEGFR2-Wnt2 pathway in non-steatotic livers. In Ob rats, exogenous VEGFA is sequestered by circulating sFlt1, exacerbating liver damage. Therapeutic combination of VEGFA and anti-sFlt1 is required to protect steatotic livers. VEGFA+anti-sFlt1 treatment protects steatotic livers through a VEGFR2-PI3K/Akt pathway.

Systemic immunity and metabolism are coregulated by soluble factors, including the insulin-regulating adipose tissue cytokine adiponectin. How these factors impact detrimental inflammatory responses during fungal infection remains unknown. In this study, we observed that mortality, fungal burden, and tissue histopathology were increased in adiponectin-deficient mice in a neutropenic model of invasive aspergillosis. Lung RNA sequencing, quantitative RT-PCR, and subsequent pathway analysis demonstrated activation of inflammatory cytokine pathways with upstream regulation by IL-1 and TNF in adiponectin-deficient mice with decreased/inhibited anti-inflammatory genes/pathways, suggesting broad cytokine-mediated pathology along with ineffective fungal clearance. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed increased transcription of IL-1a, IL-6, IL-12b, IL-17A/F, and TNF in adiponectin-deficient mice at early time points postinfection, with a specific increase in intracellular TNF in alveolar macrophages. Although eosinophil recruitment and activation were increased in adiponectin-deficient mice, mortality was delayed, but not decreased, in mice deficient in both adiponectin and eosinophils. Interestingly, neutrophil depletion was required for increased inflammation in adiponectin-deficient mice in response to swollen/fixed conidia, suggesting that immune suppression enhances detrimental inflammation, whereas invasive fungal growth is dispensable. Our results suggest that adiponectin inhibits excessive lung inflammation in invasive aspergillosis. Our study has therefore identified the adiponectin pathway as a potential source for novel therapeutics in immune-compromised patients with detrimental immunity to invasive fungal infection.

The bile acid-activated nuclear receptor Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) has been implicated in the control of lipid and energy metabolism, but its role in fat tissue, where it is moderately expressed, is not understood. In view of the recent development of FXR-targeting therapeutics for treatment of human metabolic diseases, understanding the tissue-specific actions of FXR is essential. We show that transgenic mice expressing human FXR in adipose tissue (aP2-hFXR) have markedly enlarged adipocytes and show extensive extracellular matrix remodelling. Ageing and exposure to obesogenic conditions revealed a strongly limited capacity for adipose expansion and development of fibrosis in adipose tissues of aP2-hFXR transgenic mice. This was associated with impaired lipid storage capacity, leading to elevated plasma free fatty acids, ectopic fat deposition in liver and muscle as well as whole-body insulin resistance. These studies establish that adipose FXR is a determinant of adipose tissue architecture and contributes to whole-body lipid homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: The leaves of Gongronema latifolium Benth. have long been recognized traditionally as a remedy for a variety of ailments in Africa. This study was conducted to evaluate the safety profile of the ethanolic extract of G. latifolium (GLES) leaves through a repeated dose 90-day oral toxicity study in male and female of Sprague Dawley rats.METHODS: GLES was orally administered at doses of 250, 500 and 1000<U+2009>mg/kg/day consecutively for 90<U+2009>days.RESULTS: No behavioral or physiological changes and mortality were observed. GLES did not have a marked impact on general hematological parameters and did not precipitate nephrotoxicity. However, compared to the control, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were lower and white adipose tissue paired retroperitoneal fat depots were depleted in male rats treated with GLES3 by the end of the experiment. The liver was significantly enlarged in GLES-treated rats of both sexes. Negative gender-specific alterations were observed with the highest dose. Adverse risk was evident in the female rats mainly due to marked body weight gain and cerebrum weight reduction.CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to reach more specific conclusions about to the safety of ingesting high doses of GLES for long periods of time.

When developing a sample preparation protocol for LC-MS untargeted metabolomics of a new sample matrix unfamiliar to the laboratory, selection of a suitable injection concentration is rarely described. Here we developed a simple workflow to address this issue prior to untargeted LC-MS metabolomics using pig adipose tissue and liver tissue. Bi-phasic extraction was performed to enable simultaneous optimisation of parameters for analysis of both lipids and polar extracts. A series of diluted pooled samples were analysed by LC-MS and used to evaluate signal linearity. Suitable injected concentrations were determined based on both the number of reproducible features and linear features. With our laboratory settings, the optimum concentrations of tissue mass to reconstitution solvent of liver and adipose tissue lipid fractions were found to be 125 mg/mL and 7.81 mg/mL respectively, producing 2811 (ESI+) and 4326 (ESI-) linear features from liver, 698 (ESI+) and 498 (ESI-) linear features from adipose tissue. For analysis of the polar fraction of both tissues, 250 mg/mL was suitable, producing 403 (ESI+) and 235 (ESI-) linear features from liver, 114 (ESI+) and 108 (ESI-) linear features from adipose tissue. Incorrect reconstitution volumes resulted in either severe overloading or poor linearity in our lipid data, while too dilute polar fractions resulted in a low number of reproducible features (&lt;50) compared to hundreds of reproducible features from the optimum concentration used. Our study highlights on multiple matrices and multiple extract and chromatography types, the critical importance of determining a suitable injected concentration prior to untargeted LC-MS metabolomics, with the described workflow applicable to any matrix and LC-MS system.

The development of bioactive and cell-responsive materials has fastened the field of bone tissue engineering. Gellan gum (GG) spongy-like hydrogels present high attractive properties for the tissue engineering field, especially due to their wide microarchitecture and tunable mechanical properties, as well as their ability to entrap the responsive cells. Lactoferrin (Lf) and Hydroxyapatite (HAp) are bioactive factors that are known to potentiate faster bone regeneration. Thus, we developed an advanced three-dimensional (3D) biomaterial by integrating these bioactive factors within GG spongy-like hydrogels. Lf-HAp spongy-like hydrogels were characterized in terms of microstructure, water uptake, degradation, and concomitant release of Lf along the time. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were seeded and the capacity of these materials to support hASCs in culture for 21 days was assessed. Lf addition within GG spongy-like hydrogels did not change the main features of GG spongy-like hydrogels in terms of porosity, pore size, degradation, and water uptake commitment. Nevertheless, HAp addition promoted an increase of the pore wall thickness (from ~13 to 28 µm) and a decrease on porosity (from ~87% to 64%) and mean pore size (from ~12 to 20 µm), as well as on the degradability and water retention capabilities. A sustained release of Lf was observed for all the formulations up to 30 days. Cell viability assays showed that hASCs were viable during the culture period regarding cell-laden spongy-like hydrogels. Altogether, we demonstrate that GG spongy-like hydrogels containing HAp and Lf in high concentrations gathered favorable 3D bone-like microenvironment with an increased hASCs viability with the presented results.

Directing the fate of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to dopaminergic neurons has great importance in both biomedical studies and cell therapy of Parkinson's disease. We recently generated dopamine-secreting cells from human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hADSCs) by exposing the cells to a growth factor cocktail composed of SHH, bFGF, FGF8 and BDNF in low-serum condition. In the current study, we induced the cells by the same dopaminergic inducing cocktail in serum-free B27-supplemented Neurobasal medium. ADSCs differentiated in both conditions expressed several neuronal and dopaminergic markers. However, there were higher gene expression levels under the serum-free condition. Higher levels of TUJ1 and TH proteins were also detected in the cells exposed to the dopaminergic-inducing cocktail under serum-free Neurobasal condition. TH protein was expressed in about 28% and 60% of the cells differentiated in the low-serum and serum-free Neurobasal media, respectively. Moreover, the cells exposed to the dopaminergic-inducing cocktail in the serum-free Neurobasal condition released a more significant amount of dopamine in response to KCl-induced depolarization. Altogether, these findings show a greater efficiency of the serum-free Neurobasal condition for growth factor-directed differentiation of hADSCs to functional dopamine-secreting cells which may be valuable for transplantation therapy of Parkinson's disease in future.

Mitochondrial biogenesis is a key feature of energy expenditure and organismal energy balance. Genetic deletion of PARP1 or PARP2 was shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and energy expenditure. In line with that, PARP inhibitors were shown to induce energy expenditure in skeletal muscle. We aimed to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of PARPs induces brown or beige adipocyte differentiation. SVF fraction of human pericardial adipose tissue was isolated and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) were differentiated to white and beige adipocytes. A subset of hADMSCs were differentiated to white adipocytes in the presence of Olaparib, a potent PARP inhibitor currently in clinical use, to induce browning. Olaparib induced morphological changes (smaller lipid droplets) in white adipocytes that is a feature of brown/beige adipocytes. Furthermore, Olaparib induced mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes and enhanced UCP1 expression. We showed that Olaparib treatment inhibited nuclear and cytosolic PAR formation, induced NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio and consequently boosted SIRT1 and AMPK activity and the downstream transcriptional program leading to increases in OXPHOS. Olaparib treatment did not induce the expression of beige adipocyte markers in white adipocytes, suggesting the formation of brown or brown-like adipocytes. PARP1, PARP2 and tankyrases are key players in the formation of white adipose tissue. Hereby, we show that PARP inhibition induces the transdifferentiation of white adipocytes to brown-like adipocytes suggesting that PARP activity could be a determinant of the differentiation of these adipocyte lineages.

This prospective clinical case series aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidal adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC) implantation in patients with dry-type age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Stargardt's macular dystrophy (SMD). This study included four patients with advanced-stage dry-type AMD and four patients with SMD who underwent suprachoroidal implantation of ADMSCs. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study was 20/200. The worse eye of the patient was operated on. Patients were evaluated on the first day, first week, and first, third, and sixth months postoperatively. BCVA, anterior segment and fundus examination, color photography, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and visual field examination were carried out at each visit. Fundus fluorescein angiography and multifocal electroretinography (mf-ERG) recordings were performed at the end of the first, third, and sixth months and anytime if necessary during the follow-up. All eight patients completed the sixth month follow-up. None of them had any systemic or ocular complications. All of the eight patients experienced visual acuity improvement, visual field improvement, and improvement in mf-ERG recordings. Stem cell treatment with suprachoroidal implantation of ADMSCs seems to be safe and effective in the treatment of dry-type AMD and SMD.

SIGNIFICANCE: Highly prevalent in Western cultures, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and cost health care systems billions of dollars annually. At the cellular level, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes are associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased levels of ROS production in key organ systems like adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the vasculature causes disruption of tissue homeostasis leading to increased morbidity and risk of mortality. More specifically, growing evidence implicates the NADPH oxidase (Nox) enzymes in these pathologies through impairment of insulin signaling, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction. The Nox family of enzymes is a major driver of redox signaling through its production of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and downstream oxidative metabolites.CRITICAL ISSUES: However, due to the short half-lives of individual ROS and/or cellular defense systems, radii of ROS diffusion are commonly short, restricting redox signaling and oxidant stress to often localized events. Thus, special emphasis should be placed on cell type and subcellular location of Nox enzymes to better understand their role in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases. Recent Advances: The primary goal of this review is to highlight recent advances and survey our current understanding of cell specific Nox enzymes' contributions to metabolic diseases.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: We discuss the targeting of Nox enzymes as potential therapy and bring to light potential emerging areas Nox research, microparticles and epigenetics, in the context of metabolic disease.

Molecular circadian clocks align daily behavioral and metabolic rhythms with the external day-night cycle. Priming energy metabolism for recurring changes on a 24-hour basis, these clocks are deeply interlinked with metabolic homeostasis and health. Circadian rhythm disruptions, as occurring in shift work or sleep disorders, are often accompanied by metabolic disturbances - from the promotion of overweight and type-2 diabetes to the development of the metabolic syndrome. An important indicator of the adverse outcomes of overweight seems to be a systemic low-grade inflammation which is initially observed in adipose tissues and is promoted by circadian misalignment. Interestingly, the genetic disruption of circadian clocks in rodents leads to metabolic dysregulations very comparable to what is observed in shift workers and with the development of tissue specific clock gene knockout mice, the importance of single-tissue clocks for the metabolic regulation was further deciphered. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of mistimed behavior in metabolic health and outline behavioral interventions aiming at reducing the metabolic ramifications of chronodisruption.

Group-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), type-2 cytokines, and eosinophils have all been implicated in sustaining adipose tissue homeostasis. However, the interplay between the stroma and adipose-resident immune cells is less well understood. We identify that white adipose tissue-resident multipotent stromal cells (WAT-MSCs) can act as a reservoir for IL-33, especially after cell stress, but also provide additional signals for sustaining ILC2. Indeed, we demonstrate that WAT-MSCs also support ICAM-1-mediated proliferation and activation of LFA-1-expressing ILC2s. Consequently, ILC2-derived IL-4 and IL-13 feed back to induce eotaxin secretion from WAT-MSCs, supporting eosinophil recruitment. Thus, MSCs provide a niche for multifaceted dialogue with ILC2 to sustain a type-2 immune environment in WAT.

BACKGROUND: Gynecomastia is the most common benign enlargement of the mammary gland and adipose tissue in males. Because a feminine-looking chest contour can bring severe psychologic burden to patients, subcutaneous mastectomy has become the standard treatment for this condition. Conventional open surgery causes conspicuous scarring that may affect the appearance of the breast. We provide a novel surgical operative for the treatment of gynecomastia.METHOD: With approval from our institutional ethics committee and written informed consent, 22 patients with 33 abnormally hyperplastic breasts were enrolled at The First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University between June 2016 and September 2018. Vacuum-assisted minimally invasive surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Patients were followed up with physical examination and ultrasonography.RESULT: Vacuum-assisted minimally invasive mastectomy was performed successfully in all cases, with no residual glands or adipose tissue observed on ultrasonography. The operation had a mean duration of 73.5 minutes per side, ranging from 40 to 102 minutes. An average of 320 specimens were excised from each side with mean blood loss of 34 mL. Of these 33 operative sides, 2 complications occurred, but satisfactory chest contour was attained eventually in all patients. All patients were satisfied with their cosmetic outcome, graded as excellent by 22 patients (100%). Redundant skin was observed in 1 patient at 1 month postoperatively, whose breast, defined as graded III, was the largest before operation.CONCLUSION: Vacuum-assisted, minimally invasive mastectomy is a feasible approach for the treatment of gynecomastia with acceptable complications.

Tendon tissues have limited healing capacity. The incidence of tendon injuries and the unsatisfactory functional outcomes of tendon repair are driving the search for alternative therapeutic approaches envisioning tendon regeneration. Cellular therapies aim at delivering adequate, regeneration-competent cell types to the injured tendon and toward ultimately promoting its reconstruction and recovery of functionality. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) either obtained from tendons or from non-tendon sources, like bone marrow (BM-MSCs) or adipose tissue (ASCs), have been receiving increasing attention over the years toward enhancing tendon healing. Evidences from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest MSCs can contribute to accelerate and improve the quality of tendon healing. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms underlying these repair events are yet to be fully elucidated. This review provides an overview of the main challenges in the field of cell-based regenerative therapies, discussing the role of MSCs in boosting tendon regeneration, particularly through their capacity to enhance the tenogenic properties of tendon resident cells.

A non-targeted strategy to simultaneously screen for over 100 lipid mediators from <U+03C9>-6 ARA and <U+03C9>-3 EPA and DHA fatty acids is presented. The method based on an extensive study of fragmentation patterns obtained by SPE-LC-MS/MS analysis-provided fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate and identify lipid mediators in biological samples. Many of these metabolites are associated to metabolic disorders, inflammatory, immune and oxidative stress. The methodology consisted of a three-step procedure. (1) SPE extraction of compounds from plasma and adipose tissue was followed by LC-MS/MS analysis operating in full scan mode. The methodology was validated for a group of 65 metabolites using standards. SPE recoveries ranged from 29-134% and matrix effect from 10-580%. LOD and LOQ ranged from 0.01 to 1765 ng/mL and 0.03 to 5884 ng/mL respectively, similarly than current analytical strategies based on MRM mode. (2) An extensive study of the mass spectra of a wide range of compounds was done to stablish a specific fragmentation pattern. Interestingly, illustrative fragmentations and new specific transitions to identify EPA and DHA lipid mediators have been innovatively established. (3) After analysis, 30 lipid mediators were tentatively identified in plasma and 35 in adipose tissue of rats according to the pre stablished fragmentation patterns. The hypothetical identification of compounds was validated by using reference standards. Around 85-90% of proposed identifications were correctly assigned and only 4 and 3 identifications failed in adipose tissue and plasma, respectively. The method allowed the identification of these metabolites without losing information by the use of predefined ions list. Therefore, the use of full scan mode together with the study of fragmentation patterns provided a novel and stronger analytical tool to study the complete profile of lipid mediators in biological samples than the analysis through MRM based methods. Importantly, no analytical standards were required at this qualitative screening stage and the performance and sensitivity of the assay were very similar to that of a MRM method.

In recent years, first evidences emerged that sympathetic neurotransmitters influence osteoarthritis (OA) manifestation. Joint-resident stem cells might contribute to cartilage repair, however, their chondrogenic function is reduced. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) was detected in the synovial fluid of trauma and OA patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse how NE influences the chondrogenesis of synovial adipose tissue-derived stem cells (sASCs). sASCs were isolated from knee-OA patients synovia. After adrenoceptor (AR) expression analysis, proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation in presence of NE and/or a- and ß-AR antagonist were investigated. Cell count, viability, chondrogenic and hypertophic gene expression, sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) and type II collagen content were determined. Key AR-dependent signaling (ERK1/2, PKA) was analyzed via western blot. sASC expressed a1A-, a1B-, a2A-, a2B-, a2C-, and ß2-AR in monolayer and pellet culture. NE did not affect proliferation and viability, but 10<sup>-7</sup> and 10<sup>-6</sup> M NE significantly reduced sGAG and type II collagen content as well as ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These effects were fully reversed by yohimbine (a2-AR antagonist). Our study confirms the important role of NE in sASC chondrogenic function and provides new insights in OA pathophysiology. Future studies might help to develop novel therapeutic options targeting neuroendocrine pathways for OA treatment.

Adipose tissue stem cells (ASCs), known as multipotent stem cells, are most commonly used in the clinical applications in recent years. Adipose tissues (AT) have the advantage in the harvesting, isolation, and expansion of ASCs, especially an abundant amount of stem cells compared to bone marrow. ASCs can be found in stromal vascular fractions (SVF) which are easily obtained from the dissociation of adipose tissue. Both SVFs and culture-expanded ASCs exhibit the stem cell characteristics such as differentiation into multiple cell types, regeneration, and immune regulators. Therefore, SVFs and ASCs have been researched to evaluate the safety and benefits for human use. In fact, the number of clinical trials on ASCs is going to increase by years; however, most trials are in phase I and II, and lack phase III and IV. This systemic review highlights and updates the process of the harvesting, characteristics, isolation, culture, storage, and application of ASCs, as well as provides further directions on the therapeutic use of ASCs.

The prevalence of obesity is dramatic increased and strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. Adipokines, secreted from adipose tissues, are critical risk factors for the development of cardiomyopathy. Present study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological role of autotaxin in obesity-related cardiomyopathy. In high fat diet-fed mice, autotaxin was mainly synthesized and secreted from adipocytes. The increased accumulation of cardiac autotaxin was positively associated with cardiac dysfunction in obese mice. Interestingly, specific blockage of adipose tissue autotaxin effectively protected against high fat diet-induced cardiac structural disorders, left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. Inhibition of autotaxin further improved high fat diet-induced cardiac fibrosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, including improvement of mitochondrial structure, mass and activities. Our findings demonstrated intervention of adipose tissue biology could influence cardiac modification in obese mice, and adipocyte-derived autotaxin was a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for obesity-related cardiomyopathy.

OBJECTIVES: Calorie restriction (CR) is an important intervention for reducing adiposity and improving glucose homeostasis. Recently we found that in rats, a severe calorie restriction (SCR) beginning at birth up to adult age promotes positive effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and heart. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of this new model of SCR on adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis of rats and to evaluate the effects of refeeding.METHODS: From birth to 90 d of age, rats were divided into an ad libitum (AL) group, which had free access to food, and a CR50 group, which had food limited to 50% of that consumed by the AL group. From this moment, half of the CR50 animals had free access to food (the refeeding group [CR50-R]), and the other half continued 50% restricted for an additional 90-d period. Food intake was assessed daily and body weight weekly. In the final week of the SCR/refeeding protocol, oral glucose and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed. Thereafter, rats were sacrificed and visceral fat was collected and used for histologic and Western blot analysis.RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed that SCR beginning at birth and up to adult life promoted a large decrease in visceral adiposity; improvement in glucose/insulin tolerance; and upregulation of adipose proliferating cell nuclear antigen, sirtuin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3>, and adiponectin. Refeeding abolished all of these effects. SCR from birth to adult age promoted beneficial effects on adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis; whereas refeeding abolished these effects.

Canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intractable autoimmune disorder that results in various gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for IBD treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-a in mouse models of IBD. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-a. Colitis severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-a secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-a-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80<sup>+</sup>/iNOS<sup>+</sup> cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-a-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas M2 macrophages (F4/80<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup> cells) were increased. These results may suggest a new cell-based therapeutic option for treating IBD.

Cellular and cell-derived components of adipose-derived tissue for the purposes of dermatologic and aesthetic rejuvenation applications have become increasingly studied and integrated into clinical practice. These components include micro-fragmented fat (nanofat), the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC), and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have all shown capability to repair, regenerate, and rejuvenate surrounding tissue. Various aesthetic applications including hair growth, scar reduction, skin ischemia-reperfusion recovery, and facial rejuvenation are reviewed. In particular, results from preclinical and clinical studies are discussed, with a focus on clarification of nomenclature.

Glucocorticoids (GC) increase food intake and body weight in humans and rodents and chronic stress and GC treatment-induced enhancement of the plasma concentration of GC lead to obesity and metabolic changes. In response to hypercaloric treatment, males were shown to be more susceptible to obesity than females, demonstrating that sex differences may affect energy homeostasis. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged (28<U+202F>days) treatment with dexamethasone or corticosterone on food intake and body weight gain in intact rats, both male and female. Also examined were Lee index, weights and area of adipocytes of retroperitoneal and perigonadal+perirenal adipose tissues, glucose tolerance test (GTT) and plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, cholesterol and triglycerides. Treatment with dexamethasone was able to increase body weight, food intake, area of adipocytes and weight of retroperitoneal adipose tissue in males. Prolonged treatment with corticosterone also stimulated body weight gain and food intake in males. In addition, it induced an increase in the area of adipocytes and weight of perirenal+perigonadal adipose tissue and higher glycemia after GTT in these animals, without changes on Lee index and plasma parameters after both GC treatments. No parameter was changed by dexamethasone or corticosterone treatment in female rats. Thus, it can be concluded that male rats are more susceptible to the anabolic effects of glucocorticoids than female rats, and these responses can be due to the protective effects of circulating estrogens in females, and/or the difference between males and females in the expression/activity of corticosteroids receptors.

In rodents, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is dynamically regulated by reproductive state, with greater thermogenic activity and capacity outside reproduction and subsequent downregulation of the tissue machinery and function during lactation. We argue that the main reason for BAT to be shut down is the competition between lactogenic (associated with milk synthesis) and thermogenic (associated with BAT activity) heat production within a limited scope for heat dissipation, rather than to spare glucose and lipids for milk production. To add dimension to this competition, we calculate the contribution of lactogenic and thermogenic heat production to daily energy expenditure in mice and estimate the mass-specific heat production in both BAT and mammary glands as 383 and 49<U+202F>W per kg of tissue, respectively. We have also extracted the original data on BAT characteristics during lactation from 59 papers published over the last four decades and evaluate the direction and magnitude of the changes in various parameters used to describe BAT activity and function across different studies. On average, BAT function during lactation is downregulated by ~50% when compared with females outside reproduction, both in vivo and in vitro. The level of this downregulation depends on milk production, suggesting the functional link between BAT and mammary glands. Although BAT during lactation responds to various experimental manipulations, these responses are typically reduced to ~50% of the absolute values achieved outside reproduction, with insulin and noradrenaline resistance being the hallmarks of BAT reduced responsiveness. Unlocking the mechanisms underlying the natural cycles of BAT function and depression during lactation may identify molecular pathways that are important to target when attempts are made to activate BAT in humans.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have great potential as a cell-free therapy in wound healing applications. Because EV populations are not equivalent, rigorous characterization is needed before clinical use. Although there has been much focus on their RNA composition and regenerative capabilities, relatively less is known regarding the effects of MSC cell type (adipose tissue [Ad-MSCs] or bone marrow [BM-MSCs]) and culture condition (monolayer or spheroid) on MSC-EV performance, including characteristics related to their ability to promote coagulation, which could determine EV safety if administered intravenously.METHODS: The successful isolation of EVs derived from Ad-MSCs or BM-MSCs cultured in either monolayer or spheroid cultures was confirmed by NanoSight (particle size distribution) and Western blot (surface marker expression). Extracellular vesicle surface expression of procoagulant molecules (tissue factor and phosphatidylserine) was evaluated by flow cytometry. Extracellular vesicle thrombogenicity was tested using calibrated thrombogram, and clotting parameters were assessed using thromboelastography and a flow-based adhesion model simulating blood flow over a collagen-expressing surface.RESULTS: The MSC cell type and culture condition did not impact EV size distribution. Extracellular vesicles from all groups expressed phosphatidylserine and tissue factor on their surfaces were functionally thrombogenic and tended to increase clotting rates compared to the negative control of serum-free media without EVs. On average, EVs did not form significantly larger or stronger clots than the negative control, regardless of cell source or culture condition. Additionally, EVs interfered with platelet adhesion in an in vitro flow-based assay.CONCLUSION: Adipose-derived EVs were more thrombogenic and expressed higher amounts of phosphatidylserine. Our findings suggest that, like intact MSCs, source variability among EVs is an important factor when considering EVs for potential therapeutic purposes.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic care management, level II.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of genipin on promoting brown adipose tissue activation and white adipose tissue browning.METHODS: The male C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: normal control group, genipin group and cold-stimulus group.Genipin group were treated consecutively with genipin at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a day for 9 days, normal control group were treated with the saline.The mice with cold-stimulus were exposed to 4<U+2103> environment for 5 days.Daily food amount and body weight were measured.Morphological changes were observed in the subscapular region, inguinal region and epididymis around the adipose tissue.The expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was determined by real-time PCR and Western blot respectively.RESULTS: The wet weight of white fat in genipin-treated mice was decreased by 16% , and 28% in that of cold-stimulus mice, compared with the normal control group (P<0.05).After treatments of genipin and cold-stimulus, the color of white adipose tissues was darker, and the size of lipid droplets in adipocytes was smaller, whereas the number was increased.Compared with the normal control group, UCP1 expression was increased obviously in fat tissues, including the subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissues, and brown adipose tissue after treated with genipin and cold-stimulus (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Genipin promoted activation of brown adipose tissue and browning of white adipose tissue by upregulating UCP1 expression, which could contribute to the loss of body weight against obesity.

Obesity has been called the mother of all diseases and, historically, has been strongly linked to diabetes. However, there are still some paradoxes that exist in diabetes epidemiology and obesity and no unifying hypothesis has been proposed to explain these paradoxical phenomena. Despite the ever-increasing prevalence of both obesity and diabetes, differential relationships exist between diabetes and the extent of obesity in various different ethnic groups. In addition, people with a higher body mass index have been shown to have an improved survival advantage in terms of chronic diabetes complications, especially cardiovascular complications. This narrative review attempts to explain these paradoxical and complex relationships with a single unifying theory. We propose that adipocytes are actually friends of the human body to prevent the occurrence of diabetes and also help in mitigating the complications of diabetes. Adipose tissue actually acts as a reservoir of free fatty acids, responsible for insulin resistance, and prevents their overflow into insulin-sensitive tissues and, therefore, friendly fat theory.

In the past century the western world has found a way to combat most communicative diseases; however, throughout that time the prevalence of obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia have drastically increased. These symptoms characterize metabolic syndrome-a non-communicable disease which has become one of the greatest health hazards of the world. During this same time period the western diet had dramatically changed. Homecooked meals have been replaced by highly-processed, calorically dense foods. This conversion to the current western diet was highlighted by the incorporation of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) into sweetened beverages and foods. The consumption of large amounts of dietary sugar, and fructose in particular, has been associated with an altered metabolic state, both systemically and in specific tissues. This altered metabolic state has many profound effects and is associated with many diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer (1). Specific types of cancer, like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are both responsive to dietary factors and exceptionally difficult to treat, illustrating the possibility for preventative care through dietary intervention in at risk populations. To treat these non-communicable diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer, it is imperative to understand systemic and localized metabolic abnormalities that drive its progression. This review will specifically explore the links between increased dietary fructose consumption, development of metabolic disturbances and increased incidence of TNBC.

Our understanding of the regulation of vascular function, specifically that of vasomotion, has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. The classic conception of a vascular system solely regulated by circulating hormones and sympathetic innervation gave way to a vision of a local regulation. Initially by the so-called, autacoids like prostacyclin, which represented the first endothelium-derived paracrine regulator of smooth muscle. This was the prelude of the EDRF-nitric oxide age that has occupied vascular scientists for nearly 30 years. Endothelial cells revealed to have the ability to generate numerous mediators besides prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). The need to classify these substances led to the coining of the terms: endothelium-derived relaxing, hyperpolarizing and contracting factors, which included various prostaglandins, thromboxane A2, endothelin, as well numerous candidates for the hyperpolarizing factor. The opposite layer of the vascular wall, the adventitia, eventually and for a quite short period of time, enjoyed the attention of some vascular physiologists. Adventitial fibroblasts were recognized as paracrine cells to the smooth muscle because of their ability to produce some substances such as superoxide. Remarkably, this took place before our awareness of the functional potential of another adventitial cell, the adipocyte. Possibly, because the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) was systematically removed during the experiments as considered a non-vascular artifact tissue, it took quite long to be considered a major source of paracrine substances. These are now being integrated in the vast pool of mediators synthesized by adipocytes, known as adipokines. They include hormones involved in metabolic regulation, like leptin or adiponectin; classic vascular mediators like NO, angiotensin II or catecholamines; and inflammatory mediators or adipocytokines. The first substance studied was an anti-contractile factor named adipose-derived relaxing factor of uncertain chemical nature but possibly, some of the relaxing mediators mentioned above are behind this factor. This manuscript intends to review the vascular regulation from the point of view of the paracrine control exerted by the cells present in the vascular environment, namely, endothelial, adventitial, adipocyte and vascular stromal cells.

Fructose has become a major constituent of our modern diet and is implicated as an underlying cause in the development of metabolic diseases. The fructose transporter GLUT5 (SLC2A5) is required for intestinal fructose absorption. GLUT5 expression is induced in the intestine and skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients and in certain cancers that are dependent on fructose metabolism, indicating that modulation of GLUT5 levels could have potential in the treatment of these diseases. Using an unbiased screen for transcriptional control of the human GLUT5 promoter we identified a strong and specific regulation by liver X receptor a (LXRa, NR1H3). Using promoter truncations and site-directed mutagenesis we identified a functional LXR response element (LXRE) in the human GLUT5 promoter, located at -385 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS). Finally, mice treated with LXR agonist T0901317 showed an increase in Glut5 mRNA and protein levels in duodenum and adipose tissue, underscoring the in vivo relevance of its regulation by LXR. Together, our findings show that LXRa regulates GLUT5 in mice and humans. As a ligand-activated transcription factor, LXRa might provide novel pharmacologic strategies for the selective modulation of GLUT5 activity in the treatment of metabolic disease as well as cancer.

The duration and distance of manned space flights emphasizes the importance of advanced elucidation of space flight factors and their effects on human beings. The exposure to inflammatory mediators under microgravity may contribute to the activity of different cells, perivascular stromal cells (MSCs) in particular. Inflammatory activation is now considered as a principal cue of MSC engagement in reparative remodeling. In the present paper, the effect of simulated microgravity (sµg) on TNFa-mediated priming of adipose tissue-derived MSC (ASCs) was examined. Sµg per se did not induce inflammatory-related changes, such as elevation of ICAM-1 and HLA-ABC expression, soluble mediator production, or shifting of the transcription profile in ASCs. Moreover, the attenuated ASC response to TNFa priming under sµg was manifested in decreased production of TNFa-dependent pleiotropic cytokines (IL-8 and MCP-1), matrix remodeling proteases, and downregulation of some genes encoding growth factors and cytokines. Time-dependent analysis detected the first signs of priming attenuation after 48<U+2009>hours of 3D-clinorotation. A reduced response of MSCs to priming under sµg can be a negative factor in terms of MSC involvement in tissue remodeling processes.

Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is known as a morphine-modulating peptide and was first isolated in 1985. It has been characterized as an RF-amide peptide. The traditional role of NPFF is mediation of the pain response, and it displays both anti-opioid and pro-opioid actions through central nervous system. In the recent decade, additional evidence has revealed some untraditional features of NPFF, such as regulation of the neuroendocrine system, energy homeostasis, anti-inflammation, pain transmission, and peripheral modulation of adipose tissue macrophages. Neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFFR2) is a physiological receptor of NPFF, and the actions of NPFF may occur through downstream NPFFR2 signaling. NPFF and NPFFR2 increase the neuronal activity in various areas of the hypothalamus to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the autonomic nervous system, food intake, and energy balance. These underlying cellular mechanisms have been explored in the past few years. Here, we review the impact of NPFF and related RF-amide peptides on hypothalamic function. The interaction of NPFF with NPFFR2 in the hypothalamus is emphasized, and NPFF-NPFFR2 system may represent an important therapeutic target in hypothalamic-related disorders in the future.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a major health concern worldwide and adversely affects multiple organs and systems. OSA is associated with obesity in &gt;60% of cases and is independently linked with the development of numerous comorbidities including hypertension, arrhythmia, stroke, coronary heart disease and metabolic dysfunction. The complex interaction between these conditions has a significant impact on patient care and mortality. The pathophysiology of cardiometabolic complications in OSA is still incompletely understood; however, the particular form of intermittent hypoxia (IH) observed in OSA, with repetitive short cycles of desaturation and re-oxygenation, probably plays a pivotal role. There is fast growing evidence that IH mediates some of its detrimental effects through adipose tissue inflammation and dysfunction. This article aims to summarise the effects of IH on adipose tissue in experimental models in a comprehensive way. Data from well-designed controlled trials are also reported with the final goal of proposing new avenues for improving phenotyping and personalised care in OSA.

Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory disease affecting tissues surrounding dental implants. Although it represents a common complication of dental implant treatments, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully described. The aim of this study is to identify the role of titanium nanoparticles released form the implants on the chronic inflammation and bone lysis in the surrounding tissue. We analyzed the in vitro effect of titanium (Ti) particle exposure on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts (FU), evaluating cell proliferation by MTT test and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequently, in vivo analysis of peri-implant Ti particle distribution, histological, and molecular analyses were performed. Ti particles led to a time-dependent decrease in cell viability and increase in ROS production in both MSCs and FU. Tissue analyses revealed presence of oxidative stress, high extracellular and intracellular Ti levels and imbalanced bone turnover. High expression of ZFP467 and the presence of adipose-like tissue suggested dysregulation of the MSC population; alterations in vessel morphology were identified. The results suggest that Ti particles may induce the production of high ROS levels, recruiting abnormal quantity of neutrophils able to produce high level of metalloproteinase. This induces the degradation of collagen fibers. These events may influence MSC commitment, with an imbalance of bone regeneration.

Serum levels of leukotriene-B4 (LTB4) are increased in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and it mediates systemic inflammation and macrophage reprogramming associated with this condition. Herein, we investigated the involvement of LTB4 in adiposity loss, hyperlipidemia, and changes in macrophage metabolism in a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced T1D. LTB4 receptor (BLT1) antagonist u75302 was employed to block LTB4 effects. As expected, hypoinsulinemia in T1D was associated with hyperglycemia, low levels of glucagon, hyperlipidemia, significant body fat loss, and increased white adipose tissue expression of Fgf21, a marker for lipolysis. With the exception of hyperglycemia and hypoglucagonemia, blockade of LTB4 signaling reverted these parameters in T1D mice. Along with hyperlipidemia, macrophages from T1D mice exhibited higher lipid uptake and accumulation. These cells also had enhanced glycolysis and oxidative metabolism and these parameters were dependent on the mitochondrial uncoupling respiration, as evidenced by elevated expression of oxidation markers carnitine palmitoyltransferase and uncoupling protein 1. Interestingly, all these parameters were at least partially reverted in T1D mice treated with u75302. Altogether, these findings suggest that in T1D mice LTB4/BLT1 is involved in the fat loss, hyperlipidemia, and increased macrophage lipid uptake and metabolism with an important involvement of mitochondrial uncoupling activity. These previously unrecognized LTB4/BLT1 functions may be explored in future to therapeutically alleviate severity of hyperlipidemia and systemic inflammation in T1D.

MicroRNAs are a group of endogenous regulators that participate in several cellular physiological processes. However, the role of miR-137 in the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) has not been reported. This study verified a general downward trend in miR-137 expression during the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs. MiR-137 knockdown promoted the osteogenesis of hASCs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, inhibition of miR-137 activated the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-mothers against the decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) pathway, whereas repressed lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1), which was confirmed as a negative regulator of osteogenesis in our previous studies. Furthermore, LSD1 knockdown enhanced the expression of BMP2 and SMAD4, suggesting the coordination of LSD1 in the osteogenic regulation of miR-137. This study indicated that miR-137 negatively regulated the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs via the LSD1/BMP2/SMAD4 signaling network, revealing a new potential therapeutic target of hASC-based bone tissue engineering.

Obesity has been demonstrated as a disruptor of female fertility. Our previous study showed the antiobesity effects of calcium on HFD-fed male mice. However, the role of calcium in alleviating reproductive dysfunction of HFD-fed female mice remains unclear. Here, we found that HFD led to estrus cycle irregularity (longer cycle duration and shorter estrus period) and subfertility (longer conception time, lower fertility index, and less implantations) in mice. However, the HFD-induced reproductive abnormality was alleviated by calcium supplementation. Additionally, calcium supplementation enhanced activation/thermogenesis of BAT and browning of WAT in HFD-fed mice. Consequently, the abnormality of energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis induced by HFD were improved by calcium supplementation, with elevated metabolic rates and core temperature. In conclusion, these data showed that calcium supplementation alleviated HFD-induced estrous cycle irregularity and subfertility associated with concomitantly enhanced BAT thermogenesis and WAT browning, suggesting the potential application of calcium in improving obesity-related reproductive disorders.

Insulin resistance and muscle mass loss often coincide in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Most patients with type 2 diabetes are overweight, and it is well established that obesity and derangements in lipid metabolism play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in these individuals. Specifically, increased adipose tissue mass and dysfunctional adipose tissue lead to systemic lipid overflow and to low-grade inflammation via altered secretion of adipokines and cytokines. Furthermore, an increased flux of fatty acids from the adipose tissue may contribute to increased fat storage in the liver and in skeletal muscle, resulting in an altered secretion of hepatokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired insulin signalling in skeletal muscle. Recent studies suggest that obesity and lipid derangements in adipose tissue can also lead to the development of muscle atrophy, which would make insulin resistance and muscle atrophy two sides of the same coin. Unfortunately, the exact relationship between lipid accumulation, type 2 diabetes, and muscle atrophy remains largely unexplored. The aim of this review is to discuss the relationship between type 2 diabetes and muscle loss and to discuss some of the joint pathways through which lipid accumulation in organs may affect peripheral insulin sensitivity and muscle mass.

Adipose tissue is a complex and heterogenic tissue exhibiting high variability and appears to have multiple functions, especially in metabolic regulation. Change in carbohydrate source is reported to have a profound effect in the regular functioning of adipocytes. Here, we analyzed the role of two monosaccharides namely, glucose (5.2 and 25<U+2009>nM), galactose (25<U+2009>mM), and two disaccharides namely, lactose and sucrose (both at 25<U+2009>mM) in the adipocyte differentiation process and its utilization by adipocytes as an energy source. The change in cell morphology, adipocyte-specific gene expression, and protein levels were analyzed at three different time points: 2, 6, and 48<U+2009>hr. Oil Red O staining at Day 8 of differentiation showed that no other carbohydrates were able to increase lipid content as better as 25<U+2009>mM glucose. Gene expression pattern was altered by the change in glucose concentration and sucrose was able to mimic the effect of glucose even though, the lipid synthesis was solely promoted by high glucose levels. Galactose and lactose did not show any effect in promoting adipocyte differentiation. The expression of PPAR <U+03B3> was high in the presence of sucrose and galactose, possibly of adipogenic cocktail in enhancing the expression rather than the effect of carbohydrate. Acarbose, a potent glucosidase inhibitor was able to inhibit the lipid content in adipocytes grown with sucrose as a carbohydrate source and shows the possibility of its direct utilization. Lactate production by cells upon differentiation also proved the possible uptake of glucose after sucrose cleavage.

Metabolically healthy obesity refers to an obesity phenotype with no or little evidence of metabolic dysfunction. Lower liver fat content and visceral adipose tissue, greater insulin sensitivity and secretion, greater cardiorespiratory fitness, and a predominantly lower body (i.e., leg) fat deposition are key physiological traits of a metabolically healthy phenotype. About 35% of all subjects with obesity are metabolically healthy. These individuals have approximately half the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease compared with metabolically unhealthy subjects with obesity, but they still have a significantly greater risk (by 50-300%) compared with metabolically healthy lean subjects. Therefore, absence of metabolic risk factors in people with obesity should not be a contraindication for weight-loss treatment. Metabolically healthy obesity needs to be treated, and this need is reinforced by the fact that this phenotype is not stable over time, as ~50% of these subjects will cease being metabolically healthy within ~10 y. Intervening early is therefore important. Weight loss dose-dependently decreases visceral adipose tissue and liver fat content, and it improves multiorgan insulin sensitivity and ß-cell function (i.e., it beneficially affects many of the physiological traits of a metabolically healthy phenotype); however, weight loss is very difficult to maintain. This typically results in disappointment among patients and hinders adherence, which is likely critical for the limited success of most weight-loss treatments in the long term. On the other hand, using =1 metabolic health targets in a non-weight-loss-centered treatment paradigm that includes prudent dietary changes and increased physical activity can serve as an appropriate first goal that can help motivate patients toward the long-term goals of obesity treatment.

BACKGROUND: Feline adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) have been successfully used in clinical trials for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases with T cell dysregulation. However, the immunomodulatory pathways utilized by feline ASCs to suppress T cell activation have not been fully determined. We investigated the mechanisms used by feline ASCs to inhibit T cell proliferation, including the soluble factors and the cell-cell contact ligands responsible for ASC-T cell interaction.METHODS: The immunomodulatory activity of feline ASCs was evaluated via cell cycle analysis and in vitro mixed leukocyte reaction using specific immunomodulatory inhibitors. Cell-cell interactions were assessed with static adhesion assays, also with inhibitors.

Tissue engineering technology provides an alternative for bladder reconstruction, which remains confronted with challenges, such as insufficient vascularization in regenerated bladder tissue. Short-term hypoxic preconditioning has been reported to be an effective method to enhance the angiogenic effect of stem cells. This study evaluated the effect and mechanism of hypoxia-preconditioned adipose tissue-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hp-ADEPCs) on the vascularization and smooth muscle regeneration of tissue engineered bladders. Rats were randomly divided into the following four groups: hp-ADEPC, ADEPC, bladder acellular matrix (BAM), and cystotomy groups. A partial cystectomy was performed to remove 50% of the bladder, which was augmented with hp-ADEPC-BAM, ADEPC-BAM, or BAM. Histological and functional assessments of the engineered neobladder were performed at 1 and 3 months after surgery, while the mechanism of hp-ADEPCs on vascularization was also investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hp-ADEPC-BAM significantly promoted urothelium, blood vessel, smooth muscle and nerve cell regeneration. Animals in the hp-ADEPC-BAM group exhibited higher bladder compliance and a relatively normal micturition pattern compared to the ADEPC-BAM and BAM groups. In addition, compared to ADEPCs, hp-ADEPCs promoted ERK phosphorylation activation and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a expression, thereby secreting more vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor and significantly enhancing the migration and angiogenesis abilities of rat endothelial cells. This is the first study to demonstrate that a combination of ADEPCs and BAM with short-term hypoxic preconditioning enhances angiogenesis and promotes the functional recovery of tissue engineered bladders.

Cell therapy remains a promising approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this regard, the contemporary trend is the development of methods to overcome low cell viability and enhance their regenerative potential. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of gene-modified adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSC) that overexpress hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in a mice hind limb ischemia model. Angiogenic and neuroprotective effects were assessed following ADSC transplantation in suspension or in the form of cell sheet. We found superior blood flow restoration, tissue vascularization and innervation, and fibrosis reduction after transplantation of HGF-producing ADSC sheet compared to other groups. We suggest that the observed effects are determined by pleiotropic effects of HGF, along with the multifactorial paracrine action of ADSC which remain viable and functionally active within the engineered cell construct. Thus, we demonstrated the high therapeutic potential of the utilized approach for skeletal muscle recovery after ischemic damage associated with complex tissue degenerative effects.

A 20-year-old male presented with a gradually growing mass in the left lateral brow region for 2 years. On imaging, the mass appeared to arise from the lacrimal gland, was cystic, without any bony abnormality. With a diagnosis of dermoid cyst, an excision biopsy was performed. The histopathology revealed an epithelium-lined cyst, with the wall of the cyst comprising dermal adnexa and inflammatory cells. The wall also contained fragments of skeletal muscle, nerve bundles, adipose tissue, exocrine and secretory acini, few blood vessels with occasional hair shafts, with the lacrimal gland in the periphery of the tumor. There were no immature elements, atypia, and malignant cells, thus confirming the diagnosis of a mature cystic teratoma. Primary lacrimal gland teratoma is a rare diagnosis and its presentation in adults is extremely uncommon.

OBJECTIVE:  Subcutaneous fat necrosis (SCFN) is a rare condition that may occur in the neonatal period. SCFN is an inflammatory disorder of the adipose tissue, usually found in full-term healthy infants who have a history of intrauterine or perinatal distress. It is usually a self-limited condition; however, in some cases, it can get complicated, leading to severe hypercalcemia that may be life-threatening.STUDY DESIGN:  We report and describe a classic presentation of SCFN that led to severe hypercalcemia refractory to standard treatment. The diagnosis of SCFN was made based on the finding of subcutaneous nodules and of hypercalcemia. The serum calcium level reached 16.6 mg/dL. Hypercalcemia was treated first with intravenous infusions of fluids and furosemide and then of methylprednisolone. This standard treatment was not effective; therefore, we administered a single low dose of zoledronic acid, which, in turn, was efficacious in ultimately managing the hypercalcemia.CONCLUSION:  Our case shows how a single low dose of zoledronic acid was safe and effective in managing severe hypercalcemia unresponsive to conventional treatment while minimizing the risk of hypocalcemic rebounds.

In eutherian mammals, brown adipose tissue (BAT) permits non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) through high metabolic rates catalyzed by the unique mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). The tissue has recently gained remarkable attention due to its discovery in adult humans. Approaching BAT and UCP1 as therapeutic targets to combust surplus energy bares high potential to combat the epidemic of the metabolic syndrome that has precipitated in our society as a result of our modern lifestyles. Our understanding of the physiological and molecular control of BAT may benefit tremendously from consideration of its evolution that basically outlines the blueprint of how to construct a fat burning tissue. Here, we discuss the evolutionary history of UCP1 and BAT, from its origins and emergence to its downfall in several mammalian lineages. Additionally, we delineate the annotation of UCPs in vertebrates by analyzing genomic organization and summarize the phylogeny of UCP1 within the closest relatives of humans, the great apes. Outlining whether the molecular networks controlling thermogenesis in adipose tissue (commonly known as the &quot;browning potential&quot;) pre-dated the classical thermogenic function of BAT and UCP1, and whether the evolutionary inactivation of UCP1 enhanced compensatory thermogenic mechanisms, should be of major interest to those who aim to access adipose tissue thermogenesis in a biomedical context.

BACKGROUND: The associations between thoracic cage dimension, chest subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depth and outcomes of adults with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) remain unknown.METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated IHCA patients between January 2016 and October 2017. The thoracic cage transverse diameter, internal AP diameter, cross-sectional area, anterior and posterior SAT depths were measured in computed-tomography (CT) images. Using logistic regression models, we determined the adjusted associations between thoracic cage dimension, SAT depths and the prognosis for IHCA. The primary outcome was sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.RESULTS: Among 423 IHCA patients, 258 patients achieved ROSC and 70 survived to discharge. Smaller cross-sectional area and posterior SAT depth were significantly related to ROSC. Smaller posterior SAT depth was associated with ROSC. After multivariate adjustment, the smaller cross-sectional area was independently associated with ROSC (Odds ratio [OR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.99-1.00; p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.008) and survival to discharge (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.98-1.00; p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.024), and the smaller posterior SAT depth was independently related to ROSC (OR 0.65, 95%CI 0.44-0.96; p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.030), whereas no relation to survival to discharge was found.CONCLUSIONS: In adults with IHCA, the smaller thoracic cage dimension and posterior SAT depth are associated with better survival. An adjustable compression depth based on the thoracic cage dimension might be better than the &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; compression depth for resuscitating CA patients. In addition, physicians should pay extra attention to compression efficacy when resuscitating obese patients.

Protein restriction throughout pregnancy and lactation reduces liver triglyceride (TG) content in adult male rat offspring. The study determined the contribution of hepatic lipogenesis to the reduction in liver TG content. Rats received either control or protein-restricted diets throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were sacrificed on day 65. Hepatic fatty acid uptake and de novo fatty acid and TG biosynthesis were similar between control and low-protein (LP) offspring. These results indicate that hepatic lipogenesis cannot mediate the decrease in liver TG content in LP offspring. We then determined whether increased lipid utilization in adipose tissue and muscle was responsible for the decrease in liver TG content. There was suggestive evidence of increased sympathetic nervous system tone in epididymal adipose tissue of LP offspring that increased fatty acid uptake, TG lipolysis, and utilization of fatty acids in mitochondrial thermogenesis. Measurement of similar parameters demonstrated that such alterations do not occur in gastrocnemius muscle, another major lipid-utilizing tissue. Our results suggest that the decrease in liver TG content in LP offspring is likely due to increased diversion of fatty acids to white and brown adipose tissue depots and their enhanced utilization to fuel mitochondrial thermogenesis.

Bile acids play a major role in the regulation of lipid and energy metabolism. Here we propose the hepatic bile acid uptake transporter Na+ taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) as a target to prolong postprandial bile acid elevations in plasma. Reducing hepatic clearance of bile acids from plasma by genetic deletion of NTCP moderately increased plasma bile acid levels, reduced diet-induced obesity, attenuated hepatic steatosis, and lowered plasma cholesterol levels. NTCP-G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5) double knockout mice were equally protected against diet-induced-obesity as NTCP single knockout mice. NTCP knockout mice displayed decreased intestinal fat absorption and a trend towards higher fecal energy output. Furthermore, NTCP deficiency was associated with an increased uncoupled respiration in brown adipose tissue, leading to increased energy expenditure. We conclude that targeting NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake can be a novel approach to treat obesity and obesity-related hepatosteatosis by simultaneously dampening intestinal fat absorption and increasing energy expenditure.

CB1 receptor antagonism improves the deleterious effects of a high fat diet (HFD) by reducing body fat mass and adipocyte cell size. Previous studies demonstrated that the beneficial effects of the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (RIM) in white adipose tissue (WAT) are partially due to an increase of mitochondria numbers and upregulation thermogenesis markers, suggesting an induction of WAT beiging. However, the molecular mechanism by which CB1R antagonism induces weight loss and WAT beiging is unclear. In this study, we probed for genes associated with beiging and explored longitudinal molecular mechanisms by which the beiging process occurs. HFD dogs received either RIM (HFD+RIM) or placebo (HFD+PL) for 16 weeks. Several genes involved in beiging were increased in HFD+RIM compared to pre-fat, HFD, and HFD+PL. We evaluated lipolysis and its regulators including natriuretic peptide (NP) and its receptors (NPRs), ß-1 and ß-3 adrenergic receptor (ß1R, ß3R) genes. These genes were increased in WAT depots, accompanied by an increase in lipolysis in HFD+RIM. In addition, RIM decreased markers of inflammation and increased adiponectin receptors in WAT. We observed a small but significant increase in UCP1 therefore, we evaluated the newly discovered UCP1-independent thermogenesis pathway. We confirmed that SERCA2b and RYR2, the two key genes involved in this pathway, were upregulated in the WAT. Our data suggest that the upregulation of NPRs, ß-1R and ß-3R, lipolysis, and SERCA2b and RYR2 may be one of the mechanisms by which RIM promotes beiging and overall the improvement of metabolic homeostasis induced by RIM.

BACKGROUND: Tesamorelin, a growth hormone-releasing hormone analogue, decreases visceral adipose tissue in people living with HIV, however, the effects on skeletal muscle fat and area are unknown.OBJECTIVES: The goals of this exploratory secondary analysis were to determine the effects of tesamorelin on muscle quality (density) and quantity (area).DESIGN: Secondary, exploratory analysis of two previously completed randomized (2:1), clinical trials.SETTING: U.S. and Canadian sites.PARTICIPANTS: People living with HIV and with abdominal obesity. Tesamorelin participants were restricted to responders (visceral adipose tissue decrease =8%).INTERVENTION: Tesamorelin or placebo.MEASUREMENTS: Computed tomography scans (at L4-L5) were used to quantify total and lean density (Hounsfield Units, HU) and area (centimeters2) of four trunk muscle groups using a semi-automatic segmentation image analysis program. Differences between muscle area and density before and after 26 weeks of tesamorelin or placebo treatment were compared and linear regression models were adjusted for baseline and treatment arm.RESULTS: Tesamorelin responders (n=193) and placebo (n=148) participants with available images were similar at baseline; most were Caucasian (83%) and male (87%). In models adjusted for baseline differences and treatment arm, tesamorelin was associated with significantly greater increases in density of four truncal muscle groups (coefficient 1.56-4.86 Hounsfield units; all p&lt;0.005), and the lean anterolateral/abdominal and rectus muscles (1.39 and 1.78 Hounsfield units; both p&lt;0.005) compared to placebo. Significant increases were also seen in total area of the rectus and psoas muscles (0.44 and 0.46 centimeters2; p&lt;0.005), and in the lean muscle area of all four truncal muscle groups (0.64-1.08 centimeters2; p&lt;0.005).CONCLUSIONS: Among those with clinically significant decrease in visceral adipose tissue on treatment, tesamorelin was effective in increasing skeletal muscle area and density. Long term effectiveness of tesamorelin among people with and without HIV, and the impact of these changes in daily life should be further studied.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and metabolic disorders is complex and highly associated. The impairment of adipogenic capacity in pre-adipocytes may promote adipocyte hypertrophy and increase the risk of further metabolic dysfunction. We hypothesize that intermittent hypoxia (IH), as a pathophysiologic feature of OSA, may regulate adipogenesis by promoting macrophage polarization.METHODS: Male C57BL/6N mice were exposed to either IH (240 seconds of 10% O2 followed by 120 seconds of 21% O2, i.e., 10 cycles/hour) or intermittent normoxia (IN) for 6 weeks. Stromal-vascular fractions derived from subcutaneous (SUB-SVF) and visceral (VIS-SVF) adipose tissues were cultured and differentiated. Conditioned media from cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages after air (Raw) or IH exposure (Raw-IH) were incubated with SUB-SVF during adipogenic differentiation.CONCLUSION: Low frequency IH exposure impaired adipogenesis of SAT in lean mice, and macrophage polarization may be a potential mechanism for the impaired adipogenesis.

BACKGROUND: To elucidate longitudinal changes of complex body composition phenotypes and their association with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.METHODS: A total of 17,280 (mean age, 48.1±8.2 years) Korean adults who underwent medical check-ups were included. The mean follow-up duration was 5.5±0.5 years. Body compositions were assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis. Four body composition phenotypes were defined using the median of appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) index and fat mass index: low muscle/low fat (LM/LF); high muscle (HM)/LF; LM/high fat (HF); and HM/HF groups.RESULTS: Of the individuals in the LM/LF or HM/HF groups, over 60% remained in the same group, and over 30% were moved to the LM/HF group. Most of the LM/HF group remained in this group. In the baseline HM/LF group, approximately 30% stayed in the group, and the remaining individuals transitioned to the three other groups in similar proportions. Incident diabetes was significantly lower in participants who remained in the HM/LF group than those who transitioned to the LM/LF or LM/HF group from the baseline HM/LF group in men. ASM index was significantly associated with a decreased risk for incident diabetes in men regardless of obesity status (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.71 per kg/m²; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.97 in non-obese) (adjusted OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.98 in obese) after adjusting for other strong risk factors (e.g., baseline glycosylated hemoglobin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance).CONCLUSION: Maintenance of ASM may be protective against the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in men, regardless of obesity status.

BACKGROUND: Studies on the effects of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) on the metabolism are scarce and their results are inconsistent.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this research was to examine in an animal model the effect of replacing sucrose with HFCS-55 on the levels of glucose, insulin and leptin, and on the consumption of feed, body weight gain and fat storage.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The experiment was carried out on 30 Wistar male rats aged 5 months, fed 3 different diets, containing whole grains (group I), 10% sucrose (group II) and 10% HFCS (group III).RESULTS: After the results it was found that the amount of daily energy intake was similar for all the groups of animals. There was no difference in fasting glucose and insulin level and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. The higher leptin level was determined in blood plasma of the animal fed a feed with sucrose (group 2) compared to group 1 and group 3 (360 ng/mL vs 263 and 230 ng/mL, respectively). Despite the similar amounts of consumed energy, the animals fed with modified feeds achieved higher weight gain and the effect of HFCS-55 was similar to the effect of sucrose.CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results indicate similar metabolic effects of HFCS-55 and sucrose in feed, at the level of 11% dietary energy value, on the energy intake, body weight gain and periorgan adipose tissue accumulation in rats. The results suggest that accusations against HFCS as the major dietary contributor to overweight and obesity are unfounded, and the total elimination of HFCS from the diet seems to be unnecessary. The modified feeds (containing both sucrose and HFCS) produced greater absolute weight gain and weight gain per kilojoule consumed compared to standard feeds. This may indicate not just a basic thermodynamic consequence of consuming more energy, but a change in the metabolic efficiency when consuming a diet with simple sugars and refined carbohydrates.

Ventricular waveforms are characterized by a dip-and-plateau pattern during diastole owing to an abrupt termination of ventricular filling because of pericardial constraint under conditions such as constrictive pericarditis (CP). However, constrictive hemodynamics is not specifically caused by CP.

Obesity may not be consistently associated with metabolic disorders and mortality later in life, prompting exploration of the challenging concept of healthy obesity. Here, the consumption of a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet produces hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, increases oxidative stress, increases endotoxaemia, expands adipose tissue (with enlarged adipocytes, enhanced macrophage infiltration and the accumulation of cholesterol and oxysterols), and reduces the median lifespan of obese mice. Despite the persistence of obesity, supplementation with a polyphenol-rich plant extract (PRPE) improves plasma lipid levels and endotoxaemia, prevents macrophage recruitment to adipose tissues, reduces adipose accumulation of cholesterol and cholesterol oxides, and extends the median lifespan. PRPE drives the normalization of the HF/HS-mediated functional enrichment of genes associated with immunity and inflammation (in particular the response to lipopolysaccharides). The long-term limitation of immune cell infiltration in adipose tissue by PRPE increases the lifespan through a mechanism independent of body weight and fat storage and constitutes the hallmark of a healthy adiposity trait.

Unlike white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) is mainly responsible for energy expenditure via thermogenesis by uncoupling the respiratory chain. Promoting the differentiation of brown fat precursor cells and the browning of white fat have become a research hotspot for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Several secreted factors and a number of small molecules have been found to promote brown adipogenesis. Here we report that a single small-molecule compound, RepSox, is sufficient to induce adipogenesis from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in fibroblast culture medium. RepSox is an inhibitor of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor I (TGF-ß-RI), other inhibitors of TGF-ß pathway such as SB431542, LY2157299, A83-01, and Tranilast are also effective in inducing adipogenesis from MEFs. These adipocytes express brown adipocyte-specific transcription factors and thermogenesis genes, and contain a large number of mitochondria and have a high level of mitochondrial respiratory activity. More interestingly, RepSox has also been found to promote the differentiation of the brown fat precursor cells and induce browning of the white fat precursor cells. These findings suggest that inhibitors of TGF-ß signaling pathway might be developed as new therapeutics for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is able to rapidly generate heat and metabolise macronutrients, such as glucose and lipids, through activation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Diet can modulate UCP1 function but the capacity of individual nutrients to promote the abundance and activity of UCP1 is not well established. Caffeine consumption has been associated with loss of body weight and increased energy expenditure, but whether it can activate UCP1 is unknown. This study examined the effect of caffeine on BAT thermogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Stem cell-derived adipocytes exposed to caffeine (1<U+2009>mM) showed increased UCP1 protein abundance and cell metabolism with enhanced oxygen consumption and proton leak. These functional responses were associated with browning-like structural changes in mitochondrial and lipid droplet content. Caffeine also increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha expression and mitochondrial biogenesis, together with a number of BAT selective and beige gene markers. In vivo, drinking coffee (but not water) stimulated the temperature of the supraclavicular region, which co-locates to the main region of BAT in adult humans, and is indicative of thermogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that caffeine can promote BAT function at thermoneutrality and may have the potential to be used therapeutically in adult humans.

Adipokines are cytokines produced by adipocytes that may mediate inflammatory processes, whilst adipocyte-derived proteins may have the converse effect. C1q/TNF-related protein-3 or CTRP3 is a novel adipokine that is expressed and released by most types of human tissues including adipose tissue. This adipokine, considered as an adiponectin, can normalize blood glucose by several mechanisms. In addition, it can modulate the expression/secretion of other cytokine and adipokines leading to lower insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Beneficial effects of CTRP3 against hyperglycemia-induced complications in the kidney and eye have been reported. In this review, we have presented the latest findings on the in vitro and in vivo hypoglycemic effects of CTRP3, followed by the findings on the preventive/therapeutic effects of CTRP3 adipokines against diabetes related complications.

AIMS: To study the associations between fat distribution and lung functions in healthy subjects of young adults and to explore potential gender difference in these correlations.METHODS: A total of 2101 adult participants were recruited. Height, weight, and vital capacity index (VCI) were measured and recorded according to the national physical fitness test standard. Body compositions, including body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fat-free mass (FFM), trunk muscle mass (TMM), fat mass (FM), visceral fat area (VFA), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), were conducted using body composition analyzer. Data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 software.RESULTS: We found that male participants showed significantly higher BMI, WHR, FFM, TMM, VFA, and VCI, but lower FM, BFP, and SAT in comparison with women. However, there was no significant difference in VAT between the male and female. Lung functions represented by VCI were negatively correlated with FM, VAT, SAT, and VFA for both men and women (r<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Among these negative correlations, VCI was more inversely correlated with VFA for men but with SAT for women, respectively. After dividing the whole populations by BMI, BFP, and WHR, further correlation analysis showed VCI was still more negatively correlated with VFA for all male subgroups (r<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). On the contrary, VCI was more negatively correlated with SAT in BMI-underweight, BMI-normal, BFP-low fat, BFP-normal fat, WHR-normal, and WHR-obese subgroups (r<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), while VFA and VAT was more inversely correlated with VCI in BMI- and BFP-overweight+obese subgroups (r<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Fat accumulation is highly associated with the vital capacity index in young adults. In general, VCI was more negatively correlated with VFA for men but with SAT for women, respectively, in comparison with other tested indices.

BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) could affect PVAT characters, and whether the SGLT2 inhibitors-induced changes of adipose tissue, especially the alternation of adipose tissue-derived secretory factors, affect vascular pathophysiology.METHODS: Western-type diet (WD) fed wild-type mice were treated with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) for 10 weeks. WEHI 274.1 and primary vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated with conditioned media (CM) of epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) or abdominal PVAT of Ipra- or vehicle-treated mice fed a WD. Epi of Ipra- or vehicle-treated mice fed a WD was implanted onto cuff-placed femoral arteries of apoE-deficient mice.RESULTS: Ipra increased adipocyte size associated with decreased expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrosis-related genes in abdominal PVAT of WD-fed mice. Ipra also suppressed WD-induced macrophages accumulation, fibrosis, and adipocyte death in abdominal PVAT. In CM of abdominal PVAT from Ipra-treated mice, concentration of leptin was significantly lower than that from vehicle-treated mice. In vitro, migration of WEHI 274.1 and primary vascular smooth muscle cells were more enhanced by CM of Epi or abdominal PVAT from vehicle-treated mice than that from Ipra-treated mice. Perivascular implantation of Epi from Ipra-treated mice to apolipoprotein E-deficient mice attenuated cuff-induced neointimal hyperplasia and vascular remodeling compared to that from vehicle-treated mice.CONCLUSIONS: The Ipra-induced changes of abdominal PVAT will lead to a better understanding of unveiled mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors prevent cardiovascular complications in T2DM, and the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting PVAT.

Obesity is accompanied by dyslipidemia, hypoxia, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inflammation, representing the major risk factor for the development of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. We modeled these conditions in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and studied their effect on insulin signaling, glucose uptake, and inflammatory response via activation of stress-dependent JNK1/2 kinases. Decreased insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin cascade components IRS, Akt, and AS160 was observed under all tested conditions (lipid overloading of cells by palmitate, acute inflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, hypoxia induced by Co2+, and ER stress induced by brefeldin A). In all the cases, except the acute inflammation, glucose uptake by adipocytes was reduced, and the kinetics of JNK1/2 activation was bi-phasic exhibiting sustained activation for 24 h. By contrast, in acute inflammation, JNK1/2 phosphorylation increased transiently and returned to the basal level within 2-3 h of stimulation. These results suggest a critical role of sustained (latent) vs. transient (acute) inflammation in the induction of IR and impairment of glucose utilization by adipose tissue. The components of the inflammatory signaling can be promising targets in the development of new therapeutic approaches for preventing IR and type 2 diabetes.

Though historically regarded as an inert energy store, adipose tissue is a complex endocrine organ, which is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Accumulating evidence points to visceral adipose tissue and specifically to its mesenteric component, or &quot;creeping fat&quot; as impacting on the disease course through its immunomodulatory properties. On the one hand, mesenteric fat acts as a physical barrier to inflammation and is involved in controlling host immune response to translocation of gut bacteria. On the other hand, however, there exists a strong link between visceral fat and complicated course of the disease with unfavorable therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, &quot;creeping fat&quot; appears to play different roles in different IBD phenotypes, with the greatest pathogenetic contribution probably to an ileal form of Crohn's disease. In this review, we summarize and discuss the existing literature on the subject and identify high-priority areas for future research. It may be that a better understanding of the role of mesenteric fat in IBD will determine new therapeutic targets and translate into improved clinical outcomes.

Overnutrition during critical windows of development plays a significant role in life-long metabolic disease risk. Early exposure to excessive nutrition may result in altered programming leading to increased susceptibility to obesity, inflammation, and metabolic complications. This study investigated the programming effects of high-fat diet (HFD) exposure during the lactation period on offspring adiposity and inflammation. Female C57Bl/6J dams were fed a normal diet or a 60% HFD during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto a normal diet until 12 weeks of age when half were re-challenged with HFD for 12 weeks. Metabolic testing was performed throughout adulthood. At 24 weeks, adipose depots were isolated and evaluated for macrophage profiling and inflammatory gene expression. Males exposed to HFD during lactation had insulin resistance and glucose intolerance as adults. After re-introduction to HFD, males had increased weight gain and worsened insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. There was increased infiltration of pro-inflammatory CD11c<sup>+</sup> adipose tissue macrophages, and bone marrow was primed to produce granulocytes and macrophages. Bone density was lower due to enhanced marrow adiposity. This study demonstrates that maternal HFD exposure during the lactational window programs offspring adiposity, inflammation, and impaired glucose homeostasis.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) is increasingly prescribed to patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Adipose tissue (AT) inflammation during obesity plays a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance, type II diabetes and atherogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of thrombin inhibition by dabigatran in a combined model of diet-induced obesity and atherosclerosis.RESULTS: Dabigatran-treated animals showed increased adipocyte hypertrophy, but reduced numbers of pro-inflammatory M1-polarized macrophages in the adipose tissue. Abundance of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages was also decreased in the aortic wall of dabigatran-fed mice. Multiple circulating cytokines were reduced, indicating an effect in systemically relevant secretory compartments such as the AT.CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran treatment reduces pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions, thereby contributing to plaque stabilizing and atheroprotective effects of the thrombin inhibitor. This finding is not restricted to the vascular wall but is also present in AT where dabigatran treatment reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and accumulation of M1 macrophages.

BACKGROUND: With the ongoing global epidemic of obesity in the Western countries, thigh flaps such as the profunda artery perforator (PAP) free flap, have been less favorable for glossectomy reconstruction due to large bulk of adipose tissue associated with traditional subfascial harvest. In this article, we present a series of 10 patients who underwent reconstruction with suprafascial PAP free flaps following oncologic tongue resection.METHODS: Our series included six men and four women with an average age of 53.9 years old (range, 28-71<U+2009>years). All patients underwent preoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for selection of the most suitable perforator and preoperative design of its customized thickness. Flap elevation was performed at the superficial fascia layer while modifying the plane of dissection according to the specific bulk needs in each case.RESULTS: Flaps survived in nine patients; one flap failed due to vasospasm. Mean pedicle length was 7.4 cm (range, 6-8 cm). Skin paddle dimensions varied between 8<U+2009>×<U+2009>6 and 15<U+2009>×<U+2009>9 cm. Flaps thicknesses ranged from 0.4 to 3 cm. Functional outcome was evaluated at 6 months follow up: good speech and deglutition functional outcomes relative to extent of resection were observed.CONCLUSIONS: The dissection above the superficial fascia layer represents an important refinement to the traditional fasciocutaneous PAP flap. Flap thickness can be tailored to avoid excess of bulk in the medial thigh observed in larger BMI populations.

Interruption of bile acid recirculation through inhibition of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is a promising strategy to alleviate hepatic cholesterol accumulation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and improve the metabolic aspects of the disease. Potential disease-attenuating effects of the ASBT inhibitor volixibat (5, 15, and 30 mg/kg) were investigated in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice over 24 weeks. Plasma and fecal bile acid levels, plasma insulin, lipids, and liver enzymes were monitored. Final analyses included liver histology, intrahepatic lipids, mesenteric white adipose tissue mass, and liver gene profiling. Consistent with its mechanism of action, volixibat significantly increased the total amount of bile acid in feces. At the highest dose, volixibat significantly attenuated the HFD-induced increase in hepatocyte hypertrophy, hepatic triglyceride and cholesteryl ester levels, and mesenteric white adipose tissue deposition. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) was significantly lower in volixibat-treated mice than in the HFD controls. Gene profiling showed that volixibat reversed the inhibitory effect of the HFD on metabolic master regulators, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator-1ß, insulin receptor, and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2. Volixibat may have beneficial effects on physiological and metabolic aspects of NASH pathophysiology.

Humans carry a much larger percentage of body fat than other primates. Despite the central role of adipose tissue in metabolism, little is known about the evolution of white adipose tissue in primates. Phenotypic divergence is often caused by genetic divergence in cis-regulatory regions. We examined the cis-regulatory landscape of fat during human origins by performing comparative analyses of chromatin accessibility in human and chimpanzee adipose tissue using rhesus macaque as an outgroup. We find that many regions that have decreased accessibility in humans are enriched for promoter and enhancer sequences, are depleted for signatures of negative selection, are located near genes involved with lipid metabolism, and contain a short sequence motif involved in the beigeing of fat, the process in which lipid-storing white adipocytes are transdifferentiated into thermogenic beige adipocytes. The collective closing of many putative regulatory regions associated with beigeing of fat suggests a mechanism that increases body fat in humans.

Lipo-accumulation of the dorsocervical fat pad (&quot;buffalo hump&quot;) is a complication observed in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We described the clinical outcome of people living with HIV with &quot;buffalo hump&quot; treated by excisional lipectomy.From April 2013 to March 2018, medical records of people living with HIV, who received care in our hospital have been evaluated. Among them, patients with dorsocervical fat accumulation treated by excisional lipectomy have been retrospectively assessed.Nine patients with &quot;buffalo hump&quot; among 2886 people living with HIV (3.1, 9/2886) were included. Eight were women with a mean age of 47.9<U+200A>±<U+200A>8.0 years old (range, 36-60). Most of them have been infected by blood transfusion (77%, 7/9) and the mean duration of HIV infection was 14.1<U+200A>±<U+200A>5.5 years (range, 6-22). The mean duration for antiretroviral therapy was 8.8<U+200A>±<U+200A>2.1 years (range, 6-11). The mean pre-ART CD4+ T cell count was 91.3<U+200A>±<U+200A>76.5<U+200A>cells/µL (range, 4-233) and 477.4<U+200A>±<U+200A>271.8<U+200A>cells/µL (range, 114-926) at the time of surgery. All 9 patients underwent excisional lipectomy of their hypertrophied dorsocervical fat pad. The mean size of the excised specimens was 14<U+200A>×<U+200A>11<U+200A>×<U+200A>6<U+200A>cm. The median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 2-60), all 9 patients reported satisfaction with their results, with no recurrence has been observed.Corrective surgery used to treat localized fat accumulations in people living with HIV with &quot;buffalo hump&quot; showed a favorable effect and can therefore be considered when necessary. Whereas drugs such as integrase inhibitors may avoid lipo-accumulation related syndrome and should be given to people living with HIV in China.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to define whether in a group of young women the place of residence in their childhood and adolescence, as well as moving from a rural to an urban area, have affected their biological condition.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data were obtained from 1,305 unmarried and childless women aged 18-25. The respondents were university students. Each person's height, weight and waist circumference were measured, and the BMI, WHR, and WHtR indices were calculated. A survey was used to collect data on the females' socio-economic status, their health condition and course of menstruation cycle.RESULTS: In the whole sample, apart from WHR, there was no significant difference in anthropometric characteristics depending on the urbanization degree of the place of residence before commencing studies. In comparing the two groups of women, changing place of residence from a village to a city and from a city to another city, more differences were visible. Women of rural origin presented significantly higher values of BMI, waist circumference and WHtR than those from the city. They were also more frequently characterized by overweight and abdominal obesity. The women from other cities were characterized by underweight and too low amount of abdominal adipose tissue. Health problems were found in both groups. Students of rural origin more rarely declared changes in body weight and health condition after beginning studies. Students of urban origin were more often affected by sleeping problems and spine pains.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study do not indicate that a change of place of residence has a stronger effect on the biological condition of rural women than their urban peers.

Adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) play an important role in regenerative medicine and in the treatment of osteoarthritis. ASCs extracted from lipoaspirates are a valuable cell source due to their abundance and accessibility. ASCs are retrieved from the aqueous fraction of the digested lipoaspirate. The aqueous fraction is known as SVF and includes, ASCs, endothelial precursor cells (EPCs), endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes, pericytes, as well as pre-adipocytes. To date, two types of techniques to isolate SVF have been proposed: enzymatic and mechanical. The enzymatic method is particularly indicated in SVF isolation since it disrupts the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the binding of adipocytes and other cells but is restricted by regulatory issues related to enzymatic procedures, especially within the European Community. Thus, making the search for alternative mechanical methods imperative. This study assesses the SVF harvested from subcutaneous abdominal fat via two different mechanical procedures and the standard enzymatic method to evaluate their eligibility in a clinical context. In particular, we analyze cell viability (at 0 and after 72 h) as well as the expression of cluster differentiation (CD) for each sample and the differentiation in adipocytic, chondrocytic, osteocytic linage. The mechanical procedures yielded no significant difference in cell viability and cluster differentiation pattern expression, even if enzymatic procedure still remain the &quot;gold standard.&quot; We retain that clinical efficacy in treating ostheoarthrosis with SVF administration is probably related to his anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effect, rather than the ability to differentiate in specific cell lineage. However, further studies are required to support and improve our findings.

Brown and its related beige adipose tissue (BAT) play a definitive role in maintaining body temperature by producing heat through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which acts by dissociating oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production, resulting in the release of heat. Therefore, in order to maintain high thermogenic capacity, BAT must act as a metabolic sink by taking up vast amounts of circulating glucose and lipids for oxidation. This, along with the rediscovery of BAT in adult humans, has fueled the study of BAT as a putative therapeutic approach to manage the growing rates of obesity and metabolic syndromes. Notably, many of the beneficial consequences of BAT activity overlap with metabolic biomarkers of extended lifespan and healthspan. In this review, we provide background about BAT including the thermogenic program, BAT's role as a secretory organ, and differences between BAT in mice and humans. We also provide details on BAT during aging, and perspectives on the potential of targeting BAT to promote lifespan and healthspan.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) describes a cluster of cardio-metabolic factors that predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While 35% of Americans suffer from this disorder, the specific pathways related to this disease are largely underexplored. The prevailing consensus is that inflammatory pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease, and therefore new research has uncovered how inflammation plays a critical role in the development and progression of MetS. The purpose of this review is to understand the role of major inflammatory mechanisms and their role in MetS. Our review identifies that adipose tissue (AT) contributes to the inflammatory pathways through the release of pro-inflammatory adipokines such as leptin and chemerin and dysregulation of anti-inflammatory adiponectin. Chemokines and cytokines deriving from monocytes are also altered and promote inflammation and insulin resistance. Circulating inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, Serum amyloid A (SAA), cytokines, and chemokines have also been linked to the pathogenesis of MetS. Researchers have identified the significance of CRP levels in predicting future sequelae of MetS such as ASCVD. Mast cells in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) promote both inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, both AT and phagocyte activity define MetS as an inflammatory disorder.

Over the past decades, there has been a major increase in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence in most regions of the world. Diabetic patients are more prone to cardiovascular complications. Accumulating evidence suggests that adipose tissue is not simply an energy storage tissue but it also functions as a secretory tissue producing a variety of bioactive substances, also referred to as adipokines. The balance between pro-inflammatory adipokines and protective adipokines is disturbed in type 2 diabetes, this can be regarded as adipose tissue dysfunction which partly promote the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. In this review, we not only discuss the favorable adipokines like adiponectin, omentin, C1q tumor necrosis factor-related proteins, but also unfavorable ones like resisitin and visfatin, in the aim of finding potential biomarkers recommended for the clinical use in the diagnosis, prognosis and follow up of patients with T2D at high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well as leading to new therapeutic approaches.

AIMS: Scutellarein (Sc), a natural compound and an active ingredient of Erigeron breviscapus (vant.), shows anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and has the potential for obesity treatment. However, no previous in vivo study has been conducted to assess the role of Sc in obesity. This study investigated the effects of Sc on obesity and associated hyperlipidemia and fatty liver and explores the underlying mechanisms of action in a mouse model.METHODS: The study was conducted using a well-established mouse model of obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Anti-obesity effects were assessed using body weight, abdominal circumference, white adipose tissue, adiposity index, and fatty liver index. Lipid lowering and liver protective effects were examined by blood sample analysis. Lipid dystopia deposition was confirmed by liver pathological sections. The signaling pathways of lipid metabolism and cytokine/inflammatory mediator were evaluated using Real-Time PCR and Western blot.RESULTS: Central obesity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and hepatic steatosis were developed in mice fed with HFD. Administration of Sc at a dose of 50<U+202F>mg/kg for 16 weeks effectively attenuated all obesity indicators tested. Further studies revealed the antagonistic effect of Sc on hyperlipidemia was a result of the repression of the lipid synthesis pathway, de novo pathway, HMGCR, promoting fatty acid oxidation (PPARa, CPT-1a) and increased cholesterol output (PPAR<U+03B3>-LXRa-ABCA1). The anti-inflammatory effect was attributed to blocking the expression of inflammatory genes, including TNF-a, IL-6, NF-<U+03BA>B.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Sc possesses important novel anti-obesity effects accompanying lipid lowering and anti-inflammation-based liver protective effects. These favorable effects are causally associated with the suppression of gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and fine regulation of genes responsible for energy metabolism. Our results advance the understanding of the pharmacological actions of Sc, and provides a role for Sc in effective management of obesity.

We review the two previously published cases of epidural lipomatosis associated with syringomyelia and present the case of a 42-year-old woman with a medullary syrinx from C1 to T3 initially only with upper limbs paraesthesias that presented after 10 years of follow up left hemiparesis and paraesteshias in the tongue. Chiari malformation, cerebral or spinal space occupant lesions were ruled out so as other causes of syrinx except the presence of epidural lipomatosis extending from T1 to T12. Right laminotomies where performed from T1 to T12 removing the excess of epidural fat tissue. After the surgery the symptoms remained stable, at discharge the patient progressively recovered from the hemiparesis and in a follow up magnetic resonance (MRI) it was confirmed the resolution of the syrinx. This is the third case of a patient with a spinal syrinx and no other related causes except from spinal lipomatosis, although with only three cases it is not possible to completely state that lipomatosis caused the syrinx. Our case supports the trend stablished by the two previous cases. For the treatment, initially patients should be managed conservatively trying to correct the underlying etiologies of spinal lipomatosis and in cause of failure surgical treatment, consisting on the removal of adipose epidural excess in the most appropriate way, should be preferred.

BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: Vaginal atrophy is characterized by thinning of vaginal epithelial layers and decreased local blood flow. We aimed to evaluate the regenerative effects of Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) and Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMDSC) on vaginal atrophy in rat menopause model.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into 4 (four) groups: sham, control, ADMSC, BMDSC. Vaginal epithelial thickness, structure of the lamina propria, blood vessels in the lamina propria, collagen deposition, and muscle structure were evaluated. Anti ER a, VEGF, VEGFR 1, Bax and bcl-2 antibodies were analyzed. Beta actin gene was used as endogenous control. Genetical differences among the groups were compared by using Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U test. p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.RESULTS: Epithelial thickness of ADMSC group was higher than control group, but less than sham group Epithelial thickness of BMDSC group was less than sham group. Lamina propria and muscle tissue of ADMSC and BMDSC groups were found to be similar to sham group. VEGFR-1, VEGF, Bax and ER-a staining levels were higher in ADMSC and BMDSC groups than control group. ADMSC group stained stronger with VEGFR-1 and VEGF than BMDSC group. Bcl-2 staining level was increased in ADMSC applied group. No statistically significant difference was detected in Bax and Bcl-2 genes and Bax-/Bcl-2 ratio.CONCLUSIONS: Although genetic expression might have ended and could not be significantly demonstrated, histological and immunohistochemical results favor ADMSC application in vaginal atrophy rather than BMDSC.

Obesity is a disease that results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potential therapeutic target to improve the comorbidities associated with obesity due to its inherent thermogenic capacity and its ability to improve glucose metabolism. Multiple studies have shown that activation of BAT using either pharmacological treatments or cold exposure had an acute effect to increase metabolic function and reduce adiposity. Recent preclinical investigations have explored whether increasing BAT mass or activation through transplantation models could improve glucose metabolism and metabolic health. Successful BAT transplantation models have shown improvements in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, as well as reductions in body mass and decreased adiposity in recipients. BAT transplantation may confer its beneficial effects through several different mechanisms, including endocrine effects via the release of 'batokines'. More recent studies have demonstrated that beige and brown adipocytes isolated from human progenitor cells and transplanted into mouse models result in metabolic improvements similar to transplantation of whole BAT; this could represent a clinically translatable model. In this review we will discuss the impetus for both early and recent investigations utilizing BAT transplantation models, the outcomes of these studies, and review the mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of BAT transplant to confer improvements in metabolic health.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity is a pandemic affecting approximately 700 million adults worldwide, with an additional 2 billion overweight. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a minimally invasive endoscopic bariatric therapy that involves remodeling of the greater curvature in an effort to reduce gastric capacity and delay gastric emptying. A variety of ESG suture patterns has been reported. This study is the first to use a uniform &quot;U&quot; stitch pattern across all centers to simplify technical aspects of the procedure and limit cost. This also uniquely assessed outcomes in all body mass index (BMI) categories and changes in metabolic rate, lean body mass, and adipose tissue composition.METHODS: This is a multicenter analysis of prospectively collected data from 7 centers including patients with overweight and obesity who underwent ESG. Primary outcomes included absolute weight loss, percent total body weight loss (%TWL), change in BMI, and percent excess weight loss (%EWL) at 6 and 12 months in overweight and obese classes I, II, and III. Secondary outcomes included adipose tissue, lean body mass reduction, and metabolic rate analyzed by bioimpedance. Additionally, immediate or delayed adverse events (AEs) were analyzed. Clinical success was defined as achieving =25% EWL at 1 year with =5% serious AE (SAE) rate following the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE)/American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) threshold.RESULTS: A total of 193 patients underwent ESG during the study period. All groups had &gt;10% TWL and &gt;25% EWL at 6 months of follow-up. On average, %TWL was 14.25% ± 5.26% and 15.06% ± 5.22% and the %EWL 56.15% ± 22.93% and 59.41% ± 25.69% at 6 months and 1 year of follow-up, respectively. %TWL was 8.91% ± .3%, 13.92% ± 5.76%, 16.22% ± 7.69%, and 19.01% ± .95% and %EWL 56.21% ± 2.0%, 62.03% ± 27.63%, 54.13% ± 23.46%, and 46.78% ± 2.43% for overweight and obesity classes I, II, and III, respectively, at 1 year. Male sex, age &lt;41 years, and higher BMI were predictors of achieving a TWL =10% at 1-year follow-up. There was a significant reduction in adipose tissue from baseline. SAEs occurred in 1.03%, including 2 perigastric collections needing surgery.CONCLUSIONS: ESG appears to be feasible, safe, and effective in the treatment of patients with overweight and obesity according to ASGE/ASMBS thresholds.

AIMS: Visceral adiposity and albuminuria are commonly observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recently, the visceral adipose index (VAI) was found to be an indicator of visceral fat accumulation. However, the relationship between the VAI and urinary albumin has not been investigated in T2DM patients, and whether the predictive value of the VAI is superior to that of the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-c) ratio remains unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty one newly diagnosed T2DM patients were enrolled. The anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glucose, lipid profiles, urinary albumin, and other biochemical indices were examined. Linear and logistic regression models were developed to assess the association between the VAI and urinary albumin.RESULTS: The prevalence of microalbuminuria was 41.3% (n = 141) and increased with increasing levels of VAI. An age-adjusted partial correlation analysis showed that the VAI and TG/HDL-c ratio were significantly associated with the waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and uric acid. In the stepwise linear regression analysis, the VAI (ß = .21, .009) and TG/HDL-c (ß = .25, .002) were significant determinants of urinary albumin. Moreover, in the multiple logistic regression model, the odds ratio (OR) of microalbuminuria per one SD increase in the VAI was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.11-3.38), and a similar result was observed with a higher TG/HDL-c ratio (OR = 2.03, 95% CI, 1.13-3.65).CONCLUSION: We are the first to show a clear association between the VAI and urinary albumin in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Additionally, the VAI and TG/HDL-c ratio had similar predictive power regarding albuminuria risk. The VAI could be a rapid and reliable tool for assessing early-stage renal damage in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.

Sarcopenia is a universal characteristic of the aging process and is often accompanied by increases in whole-body adiposity. These changes in body composition have important clinical implications, given that loss of muscle and gain of fat mass are both significantly and independently associated with declining physical performance as well as an increased risk for disability, hospitalizations, and mortality in older individuals. This increased fat mass is not exclusively stored in adipose depots but may become deposited in non-adipose tissues, such as skeletal muscle, when the oxidative capacity of the adipose tissue itself is exceeded. The redistributed adipose tissue is thought to exert detrimental local effects on the muscle environment given the close proximity. Thus, sarcopenia observed with aging may be better defined in the context of loss of muscle quality rather than loss of muscle quantity per se. In this perspective, we briefly review the age-related physiological changes in cellularity, secretory profiles, and inflammatory status of adipose tissue which drive lipotoxicity (spillover) of skeletal muscle and then provide evidence of how this may affect specific fiber type contractility. We focus on biological contributors (cellular machinery) to contractility for which there is some evidence of vulnerability to lipid stress distinguishing between fiber types.



#### Drug repurposing in alternative medicine: herbal digestive Sochehwan exerts multifaceted effects against metabolic syndrome.

New drug development is a challenging process that requires high-risk, huge costs and long lead times. Therefore, drug repurposing is considered a strategic and economic way towards successful drug development. Sochehwan (SCH) is a herbal formula well known as a digestive aid in traditional oriental medicine, is referred to in classic medical texts, and is available as an over-the-counter drug for indications of digestive ailments. Interestingly, another medical text written in earlier age describes different indication of SCH yet to be examined. We conducted a series of investigations using maturated adipocytes, free fatty acid (FFA) induced hepatic steatosis model in vitro and high-fat diet (HFD) mice model in vivo. Exposure to SCH regulated expression of adipogenic genes and proteins, significantly inhibiting formation of lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 cells. Similarly, SCH treatment modulated proteins related with energy metabolism decreasing lipid accumulation in FFA induced HepG2 cells. Furthermore, HFD-fed c57BL/6<U+2009>J mice supplemented with SCH exhibited significant changes in serum glucose and lipid profiles. Histologic analysis of mice liver and adipose tissue showed that SCH administration attenuated hepatic steatosis and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. In overall, the results show that SCH can potentially be used to treat metabolic syndrome (MetS) by enhancing glucose metabolism and inhibiting lipogenesis through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream signaling. Furthermore, it seems to be a feasible drug repurposing strategy for drugs originating from alternative medicine to revise the value for buried indications of some herbal prescription in old traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) classics.

BACKGROUND: Irisin is a myokine/adipokine that under stimulus of physical exercise is able to improve thermogenic capacity in adipose tissue. Likewise, taurine supplementation has demonstrated similar effects on energy metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesized that taurine supplementation combined with physical training may induce an increase in irisin concentrations, optimizing energy metabolism in obese individuals.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if taurine supplementation associated with a high intensity physical training program increases irisin levels in obese women.RESULTS: No changes were observed in body composition. DWR increased RMR independent of supplementation (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001) and irisin levels (pg/mL) showed a significant difference only in the GTAU in 1<U+202F>h after exercise (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001).CONCLUSION: DWR associated with taurine supplementation resulted in increased plasma irisin concentrations after physical training in obese adult women.

Analyses were conducted from August 2017 to September 2018.Serum estradiol levels from fasting blood and visceral adipose tissue volume from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</AbstractText>: Serum estradiol levels from fasting blood and visceral adipose tissue volume from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Brain network covariance (individual loading on structural network derived from T1-weighted MRI) and memory performance (composite score from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease [CERAD] verbal episodic memory test on learning [score range, 0-30], recall [score range, 0-10], and recognition [score range, 0-20]).</AbstractText>: Brain network covariance (individual loading on structural network derived from T1-weighted MRI) and memory performance (composite score from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease [CERAD] verbal episodic memory test on learning [score range, 0-30], recall [score range, 0-10], and recognition [score range, 0-20]).Final analyses included data from 473 women (mean [SD] age, 50.10 [15.63] years) and 501 men (mean [SD] age, 51.24 [15.67] years).

CONTEXT: Adipose tissue inflammation and dysregulated energy homeostasis are key mechanisms linking obesity and cancer. Distinct adipose tissue depots strongly differ in their metabolic profiles, however comprehensive studies of depot-specific perturbations among cancer patients are lacking.OBJECTIVE: We compared transcriptome profiles of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue from colorectal cancer patients, and assessed the associations of different anthropometric measures with depot-specific gene expression.DESIGN: Whole transcriptomes of VAT and SAT were measured in 233 patients from the ColoCare Study and visceral and subcutaneous fat area were quantified via computed tomography.RESULTS: VAT compared to SAT showed elevated gene expression of cytokines, cell adhesion molecules and key regulators of metabolic homeostasis. Increased fat area was associated with downregulated lipid and small molecule metabolism and upregulated inflammatory pathways in both compartments. Comparing these patterns between depots proved specific and more pronounced gene expression alterations in SAT and identified unique associations of integrins and lipid metabolism-related enzymes. VAT gene expression patterns that were associated with visceral fat area poorly overlapped with patterns associated with self-reported body mass index (BMI). However, subcutaneous fat area and BMI showed similar associations with SAT gene expression.CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale human study demonstrates pronounced disparities between distinct adipose tissue depots and reveals that BMI poorly correlates with fat mass-associated changes in VAT. Together, these results provide crucial evidence for the necessity to differentiate between distinct adipose tissue depots for a correct characterization of gene expression profiles that may affect metabolic health of colorectal cancer patients.

CONTEXT: In obese individuals, adipocyte endocrine function is affected by altered autophagy. Genetic variants in autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) correlated with serum chemerin (RARRES2) concentrations.OBJECTIVES: To investigate a functional interplay between chemerin and ATG7, how it may relate to autophagy-mediated adipocyte dysfunction in obesity, and the relevance of genetic ATG7-variants in chemerin physiology.DESIGN: Adipose ATG7-mRNA expression and adiposity measures were available in two human study cohorts. The effect of a high-calorie diet on adipose Rarres2 and Atg7-expression was investigated in mice. In 3T3L1-adipocytes, the effect of Atg7-knockdown on chemerin expression and secretion was studied. The influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms on ATG7-transcription and chemerin physiology were investigated using a luciferase assay.SETTING: Mouse model, clinical trials, in vitro studies.PARTICIPANTS: Native American (n=83) and Caucasian (n=100) cohort.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adipocyte chemerin expression and secretion.RESULTS: In mice fed a high-calorie diet, adipose Atg7-mRNA expression did not parallel an increase in Rarres2-mRNA expression. ATG7-mRNA expression in human subcutaneous adipose tissue correlated with BMI, fat mass (r &gt; 0.27, P &lt; 0.01), and adipocyte cell size (r &gt; 0.42, P &lt; 0.02). Atg7-knockdown in 3T3L1-adipocytes decreased chemerin secretion by 22% (P &lt; 0.04). Rs2606729 in ATG7 was predicted to alter ATG7-transcription and induced higher luciferase activity in vitro (P &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Human adipose ATG7-mRNA expression relates to measures of adiposity. Atg7-knockdown reduces chemerin secretion from adipocytes in vitro supportive of a functional interplay between ATG7 and chemerin in autophagy-mediated adipocyte dysfunction.

The obese brain is stressed and inflamed. This is mainly at the level of neurons and glial cells in the hypothalamus: a brain region where the adipokine leptin acts to control feeding and body weight. Relieving hypothalamic neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with the natural small molecule drugs celastrol or withaferin-A reverses the leptin resistance commensurate with obesity, producing a degree of weight loss found only with bariatric surgery. Here, recent evidence from rodent models of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is brought to the fore which suggests that this particular bariatric surgical procedure may work in a similar fashion to celastrol and withaferin-A alongside remedying hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis. Thus, restoring and preserving healthy hypothalamic neuronal and glial cell function, be it by pharmacological or surgical means, ensures a negative energy balance in an environment constructed to promote a one - possibly through re-establishing communication between adipose tissue and the brain.

Weber christian's disease or idiopathic panniculitis is a rare condition characterized by an inflammation of the subcutaneous adipose tissue; it is a non-specific pathological condition that remains a central issue of debate and whose outcome is unpredictable. We here report the case of a 9-month-old female infant admitted in the hospital with sepsis preceded by respiratory symptoms and followed by the occurrence of small, hard, susceptible, asymmetrical erythematous subcutaneous nodes located in the arms and lower limbs. Cutaneous biopsy showed lobular hypodermitis with polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltrations. The diagnosis of Weber Christian's disease was retained after eliminating other differential diagnoses. The patient was treated with prednisone with good outcome; during the follow-up period and during disease regression the diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was made; this uncommon outcome has never been described in the literature. The aim of this study is to discuss any similar situation where another diagnosis was made in patients initially treated for idiopathic lobular panniculitis. This highlights the need for exhaustive etiological investigations and prolonged monitoring in order to search for a possible associated disorder.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia at time of diagnosis predicts worse survival outcomes. It is currently unknown how changes in muscle mass over time interact with sarcopenia in colorectal patients treated with curative intent. Objectives of this study were to quantify sarcopenia and skeletal muscle loss from time of diagnosis to end of surveillance and determine its effect on survival outcomes after completion of 2 years of surveillance.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of stage I-III colorectal cancer patients from 2007-2009, who underwent resection and had preoperative and 2-year surveillance computed tomography scans, without recurrence during that time. Body composition analysis was done at both time points to determine lumbar skeletal muscle index, radiodensity and adiposity. Change over time was standardized as a percentage per year. Cox proportional hazard regression modeling was used for survival analysis.RESULTS: Of 667 patients included, median survival from surgery was 7.96 years, with 75 recurrences occurring after 2 years. On average patients lost muscle mass (-0.415%/year; CI -0.789, -0.042) and radiodensity (-5.76 HU/year; CI -6.74, -4.80), but gained total adipose tissue (7.06%/year; CI 4.34, 9.79). Patients with sarcopenia at diagnosis (HR 1.80; CI 1.13, 2.85) or muscle loss over time (HR 1.55; CI 1.01, 2.37) had worse overall survival, with significantly worse joint effect (HR 2.73; CI 1.32, 5.65).CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia at diagnosis combined with ongoing skeletal muscle loss over time resulted in significantly worse survival. Patients with these features who are recurrence-free at 2 years are more likely to have a non-colorectal cancer cause of death.

Cyclooxygenases are known as important regulators of metabolism and immune processes via conversion of C20 fatty acids into various regulatory lipid mediators, and cyclooxygenase activity has been implicated in browning of white adipose tissues. We generated transgenic (TG) C57BL/6 mice expressing the Ptgs2 gene encoding cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in mature adipocytes. TG mice fed a high-fat diet displayed marginally lower weight gain with less hepatic steatosis and a slight improvement in insulin sensitivity, but no difference in glucose tolerance. Compared to littermate wildtype mice, TG mice selectively reduced inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) mass and fat cell size, whereas the epididymal (eWAT) fat depot remained unchanged. The changes in iWAT were accompanied by increased levels of specific COX-derived lipid mediators and increased mRNA levels of interleukin-33, interleukin-4 and arginase-1, but not increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 or increased energy expenditure. Epididymal WAT (eWAT) in TG mice exhibited few changes except from increased infiltration with eosinophils. Our findings suggest a role for COX-2-derived lipid mediators from adipocytes in mediating type 2 immunity cues in subcutaneous WAT associated with decreased hepatic steatosis, but with no accompanying induction of browning and increased energy expenditure.

Despite advances in stem cell research, cell transplantation therapy for liver failure is impeded by a shortage of human primary hepatocytes (HPH), along with current differentiation protocol limitations. Several studies have examined the concept of co-culture of human induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs) with various types of supporting non-parenchymal cells to attain a higher differentiation yield and to improve hepatocyte-like cell functions both in vitro and in vivo. Co-culturing hiPSCs with human endothelial cells (hECs) is a relatively new technique that requires more detailed studies. Using our 3D human embryoid bodies (hEBs) formation technology, we interlaced Human Adipose Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HAMEC) with hiPSCs, leading to a higher differentiation yield and notable improvements across a wide range of hepatic functions. We conducted a comprehensive gene and protein secretion analysis of our HLCs coagulation factors profile, showing promising results in comparison with HPH. Furthermore, a stage-specific glycomic analysis revealed that the differentiated hepatocyte-like clusters (HLCs) resemble the glycan features of a mature tissue rather than cells in culture. We tested our HLCs in animal models, where the presence of HAMEC in the clusters showed a consistently better performance compared to the hiPSCs only group in regard to persistent albumin secretion post-transplantation.

In response to environmental and nutrient stress, adipose tissues must establish a new homeostatic state. Here we show that cold exposure of obese mice triggers an adaptive tissue remodeling in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) that involves extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, sympathetic innervation, and adipose tissue browning. Obese VAT is predominated by pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages; cold exposure induces an M1-to-M2 shift in macrophage composition and dramatic changes in macrophage gene expression in both M1 and M2 macrophages. Antibody-mediated CSF1R blocking prevented the cold-induced recruitment of adipose tissue M2 macrophages, suggesting the role of CSF1R signaling in the process. These cold-induced effects in obese VAT are phenocopied by an administration of the FGF21-mimetic antibody, consistent with its action to stimulate sympathetic nerves. Collectively, these studies illuminate adaptive visceral adipose tissue plasticity in obese mice in response to cold stress and antibody-based metabolic therapy.

BACKGROUND: A positive energy balance promotes white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion which is characterized by activation of a repertoire of events including hypoxia, inflammation and extracellular matrix remodelling. The transmembrane glycoprotein CD248 has been implicated in all these processes in different malignant and inflammatory diseases but its potential impact in WAT and metabolic disease has not been explored.METHODS: The role of CD248 in adipocyte function and glucose metabolism was evaluated by omics analyses in human WAT, gene knockdowns in human in vitro differentiated adipocytes and by adipocyte-specific and inducible Cd248 gene knockout studies in mice.FINDINGS: CD248 is upregulated in white but not brown adipose tissue of obese and insulin-resistant individuals. Gene ontology analyses showed that CD248 expression associated positively with pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic pathways. By combining data from several human cohorts with gene knockdown experiments in human adipocytes, our results indicate that CD248 acts as a microenvironmental sensor which mediates part of the adipose tissue response to hypoxia and is specifically perturbed in white adipocytes in the obese state. Adipocyte-specific and inducible Cd248 knockouts in mice, both before and after diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, resulted in increased microvascular density as well as attenuated hypoxia, inflammation and fibrosis without affecting fat cell volume. This was accompanied by significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.INTERPRETATION: CD248 exerts detrimental effects on WAT phenotype and systemic glucose homeostasis which may be reversed by suppression of adipocyte CD248. Therefore, CD248 may constitute a target to treat obesity-associated co-morbidities.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A number of studies concur that visceral abdominal tissue (VAT) is a metabolic organ that mostly contributes to the metabolic consequences of obesity, however reports regarding subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) are controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between computed tomography measured visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and metabolic syndrome as well as its individual components.METHODS: Computed tomography at level L4/L5 intervertebral disc space was performed in 401 mixed ancestry individuals from the Bellville South community of Cape Town. Data collections included OGTT, anthropometric, blood pressure, lipids, insulin cotinine, and alcohol consumption history.RESULTS: Both VAT and SAT were increased in subjects with metabolic syndrome (p &lt; 0.0001). In logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia treatment (for women also adjusted for menopausal age) increasing quartiles of VAT were associated with metabolic syndrome {odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 4.14 (1.92-8.93), p &lt; 0.001} and any type of hyperglycaemia (=4.45 (1.89-10.47), p = 0.001) whilst decreasing quartiles of SAT were associated with metabolic syndrome, p = 0.037. In gender specific multivariate linear regression models, increased SAT levels were associated with 2-h plasma glucose, insulin levels and triglycerides in men, ß = 0.999, p = 0.01.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that increased VAT and decreased SAT are associated with metabolic syndrome in women, but in men increased SAT has deleterious effects to metabolic syndrome components. Therefore, in men increased SAT may like VAT increase the risk of diabetes development.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is recognised to reduce risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), in part, via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may be mediated via effects on body fat distribution. Diet efficacy via these mechanisms is however unclear in patients with diagnosed CHD. This study aimed to determine: (1) the effect of ad libitum MedDiet versus low-fat diet intervention on adiposity, anti-inflammatory marker adiponectin, oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) and traditional CVD risk markers, and (2) whether improvement in MedDiet adherence score in the pooled cohort was associated with these risk markers, in a pilot cohort of Australian patients post coronary event.METHODS: Participants (62 ± 9 years, 83% male) were randomised to 6-month ad libitum MedDiet (n = 34) or low-fat diet (n = 31). Pre- and post-intervention, dietary adherence, anthropometry, body composition (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and venepuncture measures were conducted.CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to 6-month ad libitum MedDiet reduced subcutaneous fat and waist circumference which discounts the misconception that this healthy but high fat diet leads to body fat gain. The effect of MedDiet on body fat distribution and consequent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, as well as need for medications, in patients with CHD warrants exploration in larger studies. Clinically significant effects on these markers may require adjunct exercise and/or caloric restriction.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12616000156482.

Mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in the substitution of the highly conserved arginine 482 residue in the globular C-terminal domain of lamin A/C are associated with the Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2) often accompanied by impairments in the muscle tissue development. The mechanisms underlying these impairments remain unknown. The purpose of our work was to investigate the effects of the LMNA gene mutation R482L on the muscle differentiation and intramuscular fat accumulation using C2C12 mouse myoblasts transduced with the lentiviral constructs carrying the wild-type human LMNA gene (LMNA-WT) or the LMNA-R482L mutant gene. After stimulation of myogenesis and adipogenesis in the transduced cell, expression of muscle and adipose tissue differentiation markers, morphology of differentiated myotubes, and formation of intramuscular lipid droplets were analyzed. C2C12 cells carrying the LMNA-R482L construct exhibited upregulated desmin expression at all stages of muscle differentiation and transformed into hypertrophied myotubules (in comparison with C2C12 myoblasts transduced with LMNA-WT). Reduced expression levels of the myogenic transcription factor Myf6 in the cells with the LMNA-R482L mutant indicated delayed maturation of muscle fibers. These cells more actively accumulated fat in response to the stimulation of adipose differentiation than myoblasts modified with the wild-type LMNA; they also expressed the markers of lipid droplets, such as FABP4 (fatty acid-binding protein 4), ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase), and PLIN2 (perilipin 2). Therefore, the R482L mutation of the LMNA gene affects the dynamics of C2C12 myoblast differentiation into myotubules and stimulates formation of fat deposits in the myoblasts and myotubules in a tissue-specific manner.

Lipins are phosphatidic acid phosphatase enzymes whose cellular function in regulating lipid metabolism has been known for decades, particularly in metabolically active tissues such as adipose tissue or liver. In recent years evidence is accumulating for key regulatory roles of the lipin family in innate immune cells. Lipins may help regulate signaling through relevant immune receptors such as Toll-like receptors, and are also integral part of the cellular machinery for lipid storage in these cells, thereby modulating certain inflammatory processes. Mutations in genes that encode for members of this family produce autoinflammatory hereditary diseases or diseases with an important inflammatory component in humans. In this review we summarize recent findings on the role of lipins in cells of the innate immune system and in the onset and progress of inflammatory processes.

Increased phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity has been found to be associated with obesity, and metabolic syndrome in humans. However, whether or not PLTP has a direct effect on insulin sensitivity and obesity is largely unknown. Here we analyzed the effect by using PLTP knockout (PLTP<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse model. Although, PLTP<sup>-/-</sup> mice have normal body-weight-gain under chow diet, these mice were protected from high-fat-diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, compared with wild type mice. In order to understand the mechanism, we evaluated insulin receptor and Akt activation and found that PLTP deficiency significantly enhanced phosphorylated insulin receptor and Akt levels in high-fat-diet fed mouse livers, adipose tissues, and muscles after insulin stimulation, while total Akt and insulin receptor levels were unchanged. Moreover, we found that the PLTP deficiency induced significantly more GLUT4 protein in the plasma membranes of adipocytes and muscle cells after insulin stimulation. Finally, we found that PLTP-deficient hepatocytes had less sphingomyelins and free cholesterols in the lipid rafts and plasma membranes than that of controls and this may provide a molecular basis for PLTP deficiency-mediated increase in insulin sensitivity. We have concluded that PLTP deficiency leads to an improvement in tissue and whole-body insulin sensitivity through modulating lipid levels in the plasma membrane, especially in the lipid rafts.

In order to determine the body composition of parental broilers during growth from hatching to adulthood (32 wk of age), we evaluated the kinetics of fattening, growth rate, reproduction parameters, and body composition of the animals by using non-invasive tools such as medical imaging (ultrasound and CT scan) and blood sample analysis. The use of CT scanner allowed us to monitor the development of the body composition (fatness, bone, muscle, ovary, and testis growth) of these same animals. These analyses were accompanied by biochemical blood analyses such as steroids, metabolites, and some adipokines concentration. Difference in the body composition between males and females appeared at 16 wk of age. From 20 wk of age, shortly before the onset of lay, the females had 1.6-fold more adipose tissues than males (P &lt; 0.001) and 8-fold more elevated plasma triglycerides levels. In addition, females, from 16 wk of age, presented a weakened bone quality in comparison to males (P &lt; 0.001). The ratio of the tibia volume/tibia length was 33.2% lower in female compared to male chicken at 32 wk of age (P &lt; 0.001). However, the pectoral muscle had the same volume in both sexes. The production of steroids by gonad started at 16 wk of age for both sexes, and the testis and ovary development could be measured by imaging tools at 24 wk. The follicle development was correlated to the ovarian fat tissue (r = 0.80) and fatness. In conclusion, the use of CT scanner and ultrasound system has allowed investigate the body composition of live animals and actual parental breeds with to the aim of using them for genetic selection.

Increasing brown and beige fat thermogenesis have an anti-obesity effect and thus great metabolic benefits. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating brown and beige fat thermogenesis remain to be further elucidated. We recently found that fat-specific knockout of Rheb promoted beige fat thermogenesis. In the current study, we show that Rheb has distinct effects on thermogenic gene expression in brown and beige fat. Fat-specific knockout of Rheb decreased protein kinase A (PKA) activity and thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. On the other hand, overexpression of Rheb activated PKA and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in brown adipocytes. Mechanistically, Rheb overexpression in brown adipocytes increased Notch expression, leading to disassociation of the regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunit of PKA and subsequent PKA activation. Our study demonstrates that Rheb, by selectively modulating thermogenic gene expression in brown and beige adipose tissues, plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Complex perianal fistulas represent one of the most challenging manifestations of Crohn's disease. Combined surgical and medical therapy with biologic drugs today represent the first-line treatment option, but its efficacy does not exceed 60%. Recently, new therapeutic approaches, such as the use of mesenchymal stromal cells, have shown promising results. The adipose tissue is an abundant and easy to access source. The effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of local injections of microfragmented adipose tissue in patients with refractory complex fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease (PCD) were evaluated.METHODS: Fifteen patients with persistent complex fistulizing PCD after biosurgical approach and subsequent surgical &quot;rescue&quot; repair were treated in S. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital with a single-local administration of microfragmented adipose tissue prepared using a minimal manipulation technique (Lipogems) in a closed system. Clinical outcomes were determined at 24-week follow-ups assessing success rate, defined as combined clinical and radiological remission.RESULTS: Upon clinical examination at 24 weeks, 10 patients had combined remission (clinical and radiographic), 4 patients showed improvements, and 1 patient failed. The results were confirmed in all patients by pelvic MRI. No relevant postoperative complications nor adverse events were reported.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the local injection of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue is a safe and promising &quot;rescue therapy&quot; for patients with multiresistant complex fistulizing PCD. This approach might be proposed as routine because it is affordable, is minimally invasive, has no risk of sphincteric damage, and can be carried out in a day-surgery setting.

Animals undergoing calorie restriction (CR) often lower their body temperature to conserve energy. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is stimulated through norepinephrine when rapid heat production is needed, as it is highly metabolically active due to the uncoupling of the electron transport chain from ATP synthesis. To better understand how BAT metabolism changes with CR, we used metabolomics to identify 883 metabolites that were significantly differentially expressed in the BAT of C57BL/6 mice, fed graded CR (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% CR relative to their individual baseline intake), compared with mice fed ad libitum (AL) for 12 hours a day. Pathway analysis revealed that graded CR had an impact on the TCA cycle and fatty acid degradation. In addition, an increase in nucleic acids and catecholamine pathways was seen with graded CR in the BAT metabolome. We saw increases in antioxidants with CR, suggesting a beneficial effect of mitochondrial uncoupling. Importantly, the instigator of BAT activation, norepinephrine, was increased with CR, whereas its precursors l-tyrosine and dopamine were decreased, indicating a shift of metabolites through the activation pathway. Several of these key changes were correlated with food anticipatory activity and body temperature, indicating BAT activation may be driven by responses to hunger.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus infecting most of the world's population. CMV has been rigorously investigated for its impact on lifelong immunity and potential complications arising from lifelong infection. A rigorous adaptive immune response mounts during progression of CMV infection from acute to latent states. CD8 T cells, in large part, drive this response and have very clearly been demonstrated to take up residence in the salivary gland and lungs of infected mice during latency. However, the role of tissue resident CD8 T cells as an ongoing defense mechanism against CMV has not been studied in other anatomical locations. Therefore, we sought to identify additional locations of anti-CMV T cell residency and the physiological consequences of such a response. Through RT-qPCR we found that mouse CMV (mCMV) infected the visceral adipose tissue and that this resulted in an expansion of leukocytes in situ. We further found, through flow cytometry, that adipose tissue became enriched in cytotoxic CD8 T cells that are specific for mCMV antigens from day 7 post infection through the lifespan of an infected animal (&gt; 450 days post infection) and that carry markers of tissue residence. Furthermore, we found that inflammatory cytokines are elevated alongside the expansion of CD8 T cells. Finally, we show a correlation between the inflammatory state of adipose tissue in response to mCMV infection and the development of hyperglycemia in mice. Overall, this study identifies adipose tissue as a location of viral infection leading to a sustained and lifelong adaptive immune response mediated by CD8 T cells that correlates with hyperglycemia. These data potentially provide a mechanistic link between metabolic syndrome and chronic infection.

The mitral annulus (MA) is not a continuous ring of connective tissue from which are suspended mitral leaflets. Instead, it is a much more complex structure made up of a mix of fibrous, muscular, and adipose tissues. MA is a key structure in any type of mitral valve repair and recently it has been targeted for transcutaneous devices. Thus, a deep understanding of MA anatomy has never been more important. Traditionally, cardiac anatomy has been described using anatomic specimens. Currently, sophisticated non-invasive techniques allow imaging of MA with a richness of anatomical details unimaginable only two decades ago. The aim of this review is to provide a better understanding of the peculiar aspects of MA as they are revealed through these imaging techniques and discuss clinical implications related to this complex structure.

Aerobic training induces adaptive responses in skeletal muscles and white adipose tissues, thus facilitating lipid utilization as energy substrates during a physical exercise session. However, the effects of training on cytokines levels and on transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism in muscle and different white adipose depots are still unclear; therefore, these were the aims of the present study. Nineteen adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a trained group or a control, non-trained group. The 10-week training protocol consisted of running on a treadmill, during 1<U+2009>hour per day, 5<U+2009>days per week, at 75% of maximum aerobic speed. As expected, trained rats improved their aerobic performance and had augmented citrate synthase activity in the soleus, while the control rats did not. Although body weight was not different between groups, the adiposity index and white adipose depots (ie, epididymal and retroperitoneal) were reduced in trained rats. Training reduced serum concentration of insulin, but failed to change serum concentrations of glucose, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids. Training increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c expression in the gastrocnemius and epididymal adipose tissue, and reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) expression in most of the tissues analyzed. The expression of PPARa and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 increased in the gastrocnemius and mesenteric adipose tissue but reduced in epididymal adipose tissue. Triacylglycerol content and tribbles 3 expression reduced in the gastrocnemius of trained rats. Tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 were increased in all adipose depots evaluated. Collectively, our data indicate that the 10-week aerobic training changed gene expression to improve muscle oxidative metabolism and facilitate lipid degradation in adipose tissues. Our data also highlight the existence of adaptive responses that are distinct between the skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue and between different adipose depots.

Modulation of expression of adipose tissue-specific transcripts has been known to regulate adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Recently, adipose-specific expression patterns and developmental regulation of the gene-encoding retinol-binding protein 7 (RBP7) was identified. However, its expression in adipose tissue of the porcine species has yet to be explored. In this study, adipose tissue-specific expression of porcine RBP7 was identified and conservation of the fatty acid-binding domains and evolutionary relationship of the RBP7 gene were verified comparatively across mammalian species. Our in vitro and in vivo analysis of gene expression revealed that RBP7 expression was significantly high in fat cell fraction compared to stromal vascular cells (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) and increased during development (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). The level of RBP7 expression was upregulated during a 24-h short-term fasting intervention and restored 6 h after refeeding (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Taken together, these studies provide insights into the role of RBP7 in adipose tissue of pigs during development and nutritional intervention and pave the way for future studies on the regulation of retinol homeostasis in porcine adipose tissue.

The pathogenic mechanism of insulin resistance and associated diseases such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes remains unclear. Since inflammatory cytokines secreted by T cells play an important role in immune system homeostasis, we evaluated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the Th17/Treg balance in insulin sensitivity and the underlying mechanism in a rat model. After establishing an insulin-resistant rat model, the rats were injected with anti-mouse IL-6R receptor antibody (MR16-1) to block IL-6. Adipose tissue and blood samples were obtained for the analysis of cytokines, Th17 and Treg markers, and insulin sensitivity blood parameters, for comparisons with those of the normal control group, IL-6-blocked control group, and insulin resistance control group. In the insulin resistance control group, the expression levels of IL-6, ROR<U+03B3>t, and IL-17 increased, whereas those of IL-10, FoxP3, and CD4+CD25+Treg decreased. Insulin sensitivity decreased, whereas glucose, total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acid levels significantly increased. However, the completely opposite effects for all parameters were detected in the insulin resistance IL-6-blocked group. Insulin resistance can cause inflammation and an imbalance in Th17 cells/Treg cells. IL-6 can restore this imbalance and play an important role in the development and progression of insulin resistance.

Recruitment of immune cells to adipose tissue is altered dramatically in obesity, which results in chronic inflammation of the adipose tissue that leads to metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The regulation of immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue has prophylactic and therapeutic implications for obesity-related diseases. We previously showed that naringenin, a citrus flavonoid, suppressed macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue by inhibiting monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in the progression phase to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of naringenin on neutrophil infiltration into adipose tissue, because neutrophils also infiltrate into adipose tissue in the progression phase to obesity. Naringenin suppressed neutrophil infiltration into adipose tissue induced by the short-term (2 weeks) feeding of a HFD to mice. Naringenin tended to inhibit the HFD-induced expression of several chemokines, including MCP-1 and MCP-3, in adipose tissue. Naringenin also inhibited MCP-3 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and a co-culture of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and RAW264 macrophages. However, naringenin did not affect the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), an important chemokine for neutrophil migration and activation, in macrophages or in a co-culture of adipocytes and macrophages. Our results suggest that naringenin suppresses neutrophil infiltration into adipose tissue via the regulation of MCP-3 expression and macrophage infiltration.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic and intricate three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment with excellent biophysical, biomechanical, and biochemical properties that may directly or indirectly regulate cell behavior, including proliferation, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Compared with tissue-derived ECM, cell-derived ECM potentially has more advantages, including less potential for pathogen transfer, fewer inflammatory or anti-host immune responses, and a closer resemblance to the native ECM microenvironment. Different types of cell-derived ECM, such as adipose stem cells, synovium-derived stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells, their effects on articular chondrocytes which have been researched. In this study, we aimed to develop a 3D cell culture substrate using decellularized ECM derived from human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs), and evaluated the effects on articular chondrocytes. We evaluated the morphology and components of hUCMSC-derived ECM using physical and chemical methods. Morphological, histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and real-time PCR analyses demonstrated that proliferation and differentiation capacity of chondrocytes using the 3D hUCMSC-derived ECM culture substrate was superior to that using non-coated two-dimensional plastic culture plates. In conclusion, 3D decellularized ECM derived from hUCMSCs offers a tissue-specific microenvironment for in vitro culture of chondrocytes, which not only markedly promoted chondrocyte proliferation but also preserved the differentiation capacity of chondrocytes. Therefore, our findings suggest that a 3D cell-derived ECM microenvironment represents a promising prospect for autologous chondrocyte-based cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration. The hUCMSC-derived ECM as a biomaterial is used for the preparation of scaffold or hybrid scaffold products which need to further study in the future.

Adipose tissue is the main energy reserve of the body. When energy is required, adipocyte triglycerides stored in lipid droplets (LDs) are broken down by lipase, and free fatty acids are released to supply the physiological need. Intracellular LDs are active metabolic organelles in mammalian cells, particularly in adipocytes. The present study was aimed to investigate the morphological changes of LDs and the alternation of LD-associated perilipin family proteins during long-term lipolysis stimulated by forskolin. Primary differentiated adipocytes derived from epididymal fat pads of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 µmol/L forskolin for 24 h. Content of glycerol released to the culture medium was determined by a colorimetric assay and served as an index of lipolysis. Morphological changes of LDs were observed by Nile red staining. The mRNA level of perilipin family genes was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The protein level and subcellular localization were examined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The results showed that forskolin induced sustained lipolysis in differentiated adipocytes. The morphology of LDs changed in a time-dependent manner. Large clustered LDs became gradually smaller in size and eventually disappeared; in contrast, peripheral micro-LDs increased gradually in number until the cytoplasm was filled with numerous micro-LDs. The protein level of the perilipin family proteins showed obvious alternation. Mature adipocytes physiologically expressed a very low level of Plin2 protein, whereas in adipocytes stimulated with lipolytic forskolin, the protein and mRNA levels of Plin2 were significantly increased, and the increased Plin2 was specifically bound to the surface of LDs. During chronic stimulation of forskolin, the mRNA level of Plin3 was unchanged, but the mRNA levels of Plin1, Plin4 and Plin5 were significantly decreased. These results suggest that the morphology of LDs and perilipin family proteins on the surface of LDs are significantly altered during long-term lipolysis stimulated by forskolin, representing a dynamic process of the remodeling of LDs.

Current clinical approaches to treat irradiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction are ineffective. We previously reported that adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-based therapy ameliorates damaged salivary gland function in mice and that the effects were enhanced when the therapy was co-administrated with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). We examined the feasibility of ADSC transdifferentiation into salivary gland acinar-like cells (SGALCs) and analyzed the potential of PRF to promote the transdifferentiation process in vitro. Salivary gland cells (SGCs) and ADSCs were indirectly co-cultured using Transwell inserts, and increasing concentrations of PRF-conditioned medium were applied to the co-culture system. The expression of a-amylase and AQP-5 were used to evaluate ADSC transdifferentiation. Notably, on day 7, 14, and 21, expression of both a-amylase and AQP-5 were detected in the co-cultured ADSCs. Additionally, PRF increased a-amylase and AQP-5 levels in ADSCs that were co-cultured for 7 days. These data demonstrate that ADSCs have the potential to transdifferentiate into SGALCs and that PRF can promote the transdifferentiation process. Therefore, these data reveal a possible mechanism to treat irradiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and have translational medicine implications.

This study tested the hypothesis that melatonin (Mel) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes effectively suppress dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute inflammatory colitis (AIC) in rats. To determine whether Mel-exosome treatment could ameliorate the severity of AIC, we treated Sprague Dawley rats with DSS-induced AIC with Mel, exosomes, or combined Mel-exosome therapy and evaluated the effects on AIC. First, to induce an inflammatory response in vitro, we treated HT-29 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evaluated the response to Mel and/or exosome treatment. We found that expression of NOX-1, NOX-2, MMP-9, NF-<U+03BA>B, iNOS, ICAM-1, and COX-2 was significantly higher in HT-29 cells treated with LPS than in control cells, and was significantly reduced by either exosome or Mel treatment (P&lt;0.001 for all). In vivo, flow cytometric analysis showed that, compared to untreated rats with AIC, the number of circulating inflammatory cells was lowest in rats treated with combined Mel-exosome treatment than in rats treated with either Mel or exosomes alone (P&lt;0.0001). Compared with controls, as well as Mel or exosome treatment alone, combined Mel-exosome treatment ameliorated the effects of DSS-induced AIC as evidenced by changes in the expression of markers for inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis (P&lt;0.0001 for all). Additionally, histopathological findings showed that colon injury score, expression of inflammatory and DNA-damage markers, and bloody stool were all improved following combined Mel-exosome treatment (P&lt;0.0001 for all). In conclusion, combined Mel-exosome treatment significantly protected the rat colon against DSS-induced AIC injury.

To evaluate the effect of overfeeding on fatty acid distribution and metabolism, especially stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) indices, 8 cats in the experimental and control groups (4 per group) were evaluated in this study. The experiments involved feeding the experimental group cats twice their daily energy requirement with a commercial diet for 4 weeks. The control group was fed the estimated daily energy requirement with the same diet. Body weight, feline body mass index, body condition score, several zoometry measurements, and plasma metabolites/hepatic injury markers were measured in all the cats before and after the experiment. In addition, the fatty acid profiles in the liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured after the experiment. After 4 weeks of overfeeding, the experimental group demonstrated significant increases in hepatic C18:1, plasma triglyceride, and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations and in alanine aminotransferase activity. Furthermore, hepatic SCD-1 indices were positively correlated with body weight, feline body mass index, body condition score, and plasma NEFA concentration, although subcutaneous adipose tissue did not demonstrate any increase in SCD-1 indices in this study. The increase in hepatic SCD-1 indices might be enhanced by the inflow of plasma NEFA into the liver, and NEFA toxicity might stimulate C18:1 synthesis by SCD-1.

There are many studies on certain skin cell specifications and their contribution to wound healing. In this review, we provide an overview of dermal cell heterogeneity and their participation in skin repair, scar formation, and in the composition of skin substitutes. The papillary, reticular, and hair follicle associated fibroblasts differ not only topographically, but also functionally. Human skin has a number of particular characteristics that are different from murine skin. This should be taken into account in experimental procedures. Dermal cells react differently to skin wounding, remodel the extracellular matrix in their own manner, and convert to myofibroblasts to different extents. Recent studies indicate a special role of papillary fibroblasts in the favorable outcome of wound healing and epithelial-mesenchyme interactions. Neofolliculogenesis can substantially reduce scarring. The role of hair follicle mesenchyme cells in skin repair and possible therapeutic applications is discussed. Participation of dermal cell types in wound healing is described, with the addition of possible mechanisms underlying different outcomes in embryonic and adult tissues in the context of cell population characteristics and extracellular matrix composition and properties. Dermal white adipose tissue involvement in wound healing is also overviewed. Characteristics of myofibroblasts and their activity in scar formation is extensively discussed. Cellular mechanisms of scarring and possible ways for its prevention are highlighted. Data on keloid cells are provided with emphasis on their specific characteristics. We also discuss the contribution of tissue tension to the scar formation as well as the criteria and effectiveness of skin substitutes in skin reconstruction. Special attention is given to the properties of skin substitutes in terms of cell composition and the ability to prevent scarring.

An adequate intake of essential (EAA) and non-essential amino acids (NEAA) is crucial to preserve cell integrity and whole-body metabolism. EAA introduced with diet may be insufficient to meet the organismal needs, especially under increased physiological requirements or in pathological conditions, and may condition lifespan. We therefore examined the effects of iso-caloric and providing the same nitrogenous content diets, any diet containing different stoichiometric blends of EAA/NEAA, on mouse lifespan. Three groups of just-weaned male Balb/C mice were fed exclusively with special diets with varying EAA/NEAA ratios, ranging from 100%/0% to 0%/100%. Three additional groups of mice were fed with different diets, two based on casein as alimentary proteins, one providing the said protein, one reproducing the amino acidic composition of casein, and the third one, the control group, was fed by a standard laboratory diet. Mouse lifespan was inversely correlated with the percentage of NEAA introduced with each diet. Either limiting EAA, or exceeding NEAA, induced rapid and permanent structural modifications on muscle and adipose tissue, independently of caloric intake. These changes significantly affected food and water intake, body weight, and lifespan. Dietary intake of varying EAA/NEAA ratios induced changes in several organs and profoundly influenced murine lifespan. The balanced content of EAA provided by dietary proteins should be considered as the preferable means for &quot;optimal&quot; nutrition and the elevated or unbalanced intake of NEAA provided by food proteins may negatively affect the health and lifespan of mice.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: ShengMai-Yin and Ganmaidazao decoction are classic formulas in traditional Chinese medicine. Individually, Shengmai-Yin is used to treat cardiovascular diseases, and Ganmaidazao decoction for therapy of mental disorders. The combination of Shengmai-Yin and Ganmaidazao decoction (SGD) is normally used as adjuvant therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).AIM OF THE STUDY: The central aim is to elucidate the pharmacological efficacy of SGD and its mechanism in the treatment of T2DM with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Active ingredients in SGD and their drug targets were identified using network analysis followed by experimental validation. First, existing databases were mined for information relevant to SGD, including pharmacological actions, chemical components, physicochemical characteristics, potential targets, and implicated diseases. Candidate patterns obtained with the network analysis were then tested in a KKAy mouse model of T2DM with NAFLD. Various doses of SGD were administered, followed by measurements of fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance tests, insulin tolerance tests, markers of lipid metabolism - including free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) - liver histology, and expression levels of implicated molecules including PI3K/AKT and PPARa.RESULTS: Over 300 potential active compounds with their physicochemical characteristics and 562 candidate targets were collected, and then the network of them was constructed. Follow-up pathway and functional enrichment analyses indicated that SGD influences metabolism-related signaling pathways including PI3K-Akt, AMPK, and PPAR. In validation experiments, treatment of KKAy mice with SGD reduced serum levels of glucose, TC, TG, and FFA, decreased numbers of crown-like structures in visceral adipose tissue, reduced adipocyte size, and lowered liver lipid deposits. Further, SGD improved liver metabolism by increasing the expressions of PPARa, HSL, and PI3K/Akt, and decreasing expressions of SREBP-1 and FASN, inhibiting lipid biosynthesis, and increasing insulin sensitivity.CONCLUSION: Experimental validation of network analysis revealed anti-diabetic effects of the plant product SGD, manifested most notably by improved serum profiles and diminished insulin resistance. These experimental results may have clinical implications.

Increasing evidence indicates that normal adipose tissue transplantation improves whole-body energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. Adipose tissue macrophages are associated with glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and obesity in humans, offering a potential target for therapeutics. However, whether transplantation of autologous adipose tissue that changes the macrophage phenotype directly contributes to systemic glucose intolerance has not been determined. We specifically developed our device, with more refined wavelengths of light to activate the macrophage phenotype in isolated subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from host HFD mice. Autologous transplantation of photoactivated sWAT into HFD mice significantly reverses the M1 macrophage phenotype into M2, reduces the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissues of HFD mice, and decreases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Strikingly, this transplantation reduced blood glucose levels and caused significant improvement in glucose tolerance, which was not shown in sham-operated or nonphotoactivated sWAT-transplanted HFD mice. Moreover, positron emission/computed tomography scans indicated higher glucose uptake in the heart but not in the liver, hindlimb muscles, or abdominal sWAT. These data suggested that the ability of photoactivation to shift Adipose tissue macrophage polarization in HFD mice caused a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and that autologous transplantation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetes.

Rapid advances in the isolation of multipotent progenitor cells, routinely called mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), from various human tissues and organs have provided impetus to the field of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The most widely studied sources of MSCs include bone marrow, adipose, muscle, peripheral blood, umbilical cord, placenta, fetal tissue, and amniotic fluid. According to the standard definition of MSCs, these clonal cells adhere to plastic, express cluster of differentiation (CD) markers such as CD73, CD90, and CD105 markers, and can differentiate into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages in vitro. However, isolated MSCs have been reported to vary in their potency and self-renewal potential. As a result, the MSCs used for clinical applications often lead to variable or even conflicting results. The lack of uniform characterization methods both in vitro and in vivo also contributes to this confusion. Therefore, the name &quot;MSCs&quot; itself has been increasingly questioned lately. As the use of MSCs is expanding rapidly, there is an increasing need to understand the potential sources and specific potencies of MSCs. This review discusses and compares the characteristics of MSCs and suggests that the variations in their distinctive features are dependent on the source and method of isolation as well as epigenetic changes during maintenance and growth. We also discuss the potential opportunities and challenges of MSC research with the hope to stimulate their use for therapeutic and regenerative medicine.

Previous studies stated that stem cell functions are reduced under high glucose environment, leading to reduce stem cell capability of tissue regeneration. This study aimed to investigate if stem cells preconditioned with resveratrol show better therapeutic effect on the treatment of liver dysfunction in diabetic rats than stem cells without resveratrol precondition. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups including sham, DM (diabetic rats), DM + ADSC (DM rats receiving autologous transplantation of adipose-derived stem cells), and DM + pre-R-ADSC (DM rats receiving ADSC preconditioned with resveratrol). Compared with sham group, experimental results showed that DM group induced suppression of survival, suppression of Sirt1, activation of apoptotic, and activation of fibrotic pathways, leading to liver dysfunction. Autologous transplantation of ADSC (DM + ADSC) improved above pathways except for fibrotic signaling. By contrast, transplantation of resveratrol preconditioned ADSC (DM + pre-R-ADSC) significantly improved above pathways including fibrosis. Supplemental evidences suggest that resveratrol precondition increases ADSC viability under high glucose stress via Sirt1 and IGF1R expressions. Furthermore, increased secretion of IGF1 via paracrine route also confirmed in ADSC preconditioned with resveratrol. The experimental results imply that ADSC preconditioned with resveratrol shows potential in the treatment of liver dysfunction in DM patients with liver dysfunction.

Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) has been postulated to mediate skeletal fragility in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) induces a substantial weight loss and resolution of comorbidities. However, the procedure induces increased bone turnover and fracture rates. No previous study has evaluated biopsy-measured BMAT fraction preoperatively and after RYGB. In this study, we aimed to investigate BMAT fraction of the hip in participants with and without T2D preoperatively and 1 year after RYGB and explore factors associated with BMAT change. Patients with morbid obesity scheduled for RYGB were examined preoperatively and 1 year after RYGB. Forty-four participants were included and preoperative examinations were possible in 35. Of these, 33 (94%) met for follow-up, 2 were excluded, and BMAT estimation was not possible in 1. Eighteen (60%) of the participants were females and 11 (37%) had T2D. Preoperative BMAT fraction was positively associated with glycosylated hemoglobin and negatively associated with areal bone mineral density (aBMD). After RYGB, BMAT fraction decreased from 40.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.7% to 35.6<U+2009>±<U+2009>12.8%, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.042, or with mean percent change of 10.7% of preoperative BMAT fraction. Change in BMAT fraction was positively associated with change in body mass index (BMI) and total body fat. In females, we observed a mean percent reduction of 22.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>19.6%, whereas in males BMAT increased with a mean percent of 6.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>37.5%, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009. For males, changes in estradiol were associated with BMAT change; this was not observed for females. In participants with and without T2D, the mean percent BMAT reduction was 5.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>36.9% and 13.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>28.0%, respectively, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.52. We conclude that a high BMAT seems to be associated with lower aBMD and poorer glycemic control in obese subjects. After RYGB, we observed a significant decrease in BMAT. The reduction in BMAT did not differ between participants with and without T2D, but appeared sex specific. © 2019 The Authors.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the progressive stage non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is the predominant cause of chronic liver disease globally. As part of the complex pathogenesis, natural killer (NK) cells have been implicated in the development of liver inflammation in experimental murine models of NASH. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how NK cells are affected in humans with this disease. Here, we explored the presence of disease-specific changes within circulating and tissue-resident NK cell populations, as well as within other major immune cell subsets, in patients with liver biopsy-confirmed NAFLD. Using 18-color-flow cytometry, substantial changes were observed in certain myeloid populations in patients as compared to controls. NK cell numbers, on the other hand, were not altered. Furthermore, only minor differences in expression of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors were noted, with the exception of an increased expression of NKG2D on NK cells from patients with NASH. NK cell differentiation remained constant, and NK cells from these patients retain their ability to respond adequately upon stimulation. Instead, considerable alterations were observed between liver, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood NK cells, independently of disease status. Taken together, these results increase our understanding of the importance of the local microenvironment in shaping the NK cell compartment and stress the need for further studies exploring how NASH affects intrahepatic NK cells in humans.

Adipose tissue has been recognized as a complex organ with endocrine and metabolic roles. The excess of fat mass, as occurs during overweight and obesity states, alters the regulation of adipose tissue, contributing to the development of obesity-related disorders. In this regard, many epidemiological studies shown an association between obesity and numerous types of malignancies, comprising those linked to the endocrine system (e.g., breast, endometrial, ovarian, thyroid and prostate cancers). Multiple factors may contribute to this phenomenon, such as hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, abnormal adipokines secretion and metabolism. Among adipokines, growing interest has been placed in recent years on adiponectin (APN) and on its role in carcinogenesis. APN is secreted by adipose tissue and exerts both anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative actions. It has been demonstrated that APN is drastically decreased in obese individuals and that it can play a crucial role in tumor growth. Although literature data on the impact of APN on carcinogenesis are sometimes conflicting, the most accredited hypothesis is that it has a protective action, preventing cancer development and progression. The aim of the present review is to summarize the currently available evidence on the involvement of APN and its signaling in the etiology of cancer, focusing on endocrine malignancies.

AIMS: Maternal smoking is considered a risk factor for childhood obesity. In a rat model of tobacco exposure during breastfeeding, we previously reported hyperphagia, overweight, increased visceral fat and hyperleptinemia in adult female offspring. Obesity and eating disorders are associated with impairment in the endocannabinoid (EC) and dopaminergic (DA) systems. Considering that women are prone to eating disorders, we hypothesize that adult female Wistar rats that were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) during the suckling period would develop EC and DA systems deregulation, possibly explaining the eating disorder in this model.MATERIAL AND METHODS: To mimic maternal smoking, from postnatal day 3 to 21, dams and offspring were exposed to a smoking machine, 4×/day/1<U+202F>h (CS group). Control animals were exposed to ambient air. Offspring were evaluated at 26<U+202F>weeks of age.KEY FINDINGS: Concerning the EC system, the CS group had increased expression of diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and decreased in the liver. In the visceral adipose tissue, the EC receptor (CB1r) was decreased. Regarding the DA system, the CS group showed higher dopamine transporter (DAT) protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and lower DA receptor (D2r) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). We also assessed the hypothalamic leptin signaling, which was shown to be unchanged. CS offspring showed decreased plasma 17ß-estradiol.SIGNIFICANCE: Neonatal CS exposure induces changes in some biomarkers of the EC and DA systems, which can partially explain the hyperphagia observed in female rats.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding xanthan gum to the diet of rats on the production of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors and on tumor development in rats inoculated with Walker 256 tumor cells.METHODS: Fifty-six rats were divided into 4 groups: control diet (C), control diet with tumor (TC), xanthan gum diet (XG), xanthan gum diet with tumor (TXG).RESULTS: The ingestion of xanthan gum promotes changes in cytokine content: increasing IL-6 TNF-a and IL-10 in retroperitoneal adipose tissue compared to the control group; and increasing TNF-a in the mesenteric adipose tissue compared to the C and TXG groups. On the contrary, the addition of xanthan gum to the diet did not affect the development of Walker 256 tumors in rats.CONCLUSION: The continuous use of xanthan gum triggered a pro-inflammatory response, promoting an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissue, but it did not have an effect on the tumor development in the animals inoculated with Walker 256 tumor cells.

CONTEXT: Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4) is expressed in adipose tissue and may impair glucose homeostasis and promote atherosclerotic processes.OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between serum FABP4 and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.DESIGN: Case-cohort study embedded within a sample of 27,548 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort.PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A randomly drawn subcohort (n=2194) of participants who were free of cardiovascular disease and T2D at study baseline and 728 incident T2D cases, 206 incident stroke cases, and 185 incident MI cases with an average 8.2 (±1.7) years of follow up.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident T2D, MI and stroke.RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted model taking into account age, sex, education and lifestyle factors, body mass index and waist circumference, the hazard ratios (HRs) in the highest versus lowest quartile of FABP4 were 1.81 (95% CI, 1.21-2.70; P for trend = 0.01) for T2D, 0.93 (95%CI, 0.55-1.55; P for trend =0.68) for MI and 1.41 (95% CI, 0.80-2.49; P for trend = 0.24) for stroke, respectively. Adjustment for HbA1c further attenuated the association for T2D. In analyses stratified by sex, no statistically significant differences could be seen for associations between FABP4 and T2D and MI (P-interaction by sex = 0.27 and 0.84, respectively), whereas a higher risk of stroke was observed in men (HR: 2.70, 95% CI 1.20-6.00; P-value =0.04), but not in women (HR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.31-1.60; P-value = 0.53; P for interaction = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: These data give support to the hypothesis that elevated FABP4 levels may contribute to T2D risk. In contrast, our data did not support the hypothesis that circulating FABP4 may be relevant for myocardial infarction, whereas the observed association with stroke in men may need further evaluation.

CONTEXT: Diabetes causes severe pathological changes to the microvasculature in many organs and tissues, and is at the same time associated with an increased risk of coronary and peripheral macrovascular events. We herein review alterations in angiogenesis observed in human and experimental diabetes and how they contribute to diabetes onset and development of vascular complications.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The English language medical literature was searched for articles reporting on angio/vasculogenesis abnormalities in diabetes, their clinical manifestations, mechanistic aspects, and possible therapeutic implications.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Angiogenesis is a complex process, driven by a multiplicity of molecular mechanisms and involved in several physiological and pathological conditions. Incompetent angiogenesis is pervasive to diabetic vascular complications, with both excessive and defective angiogenesis observed in various tissues. A striking different angiogenic response typically occurs in the retina versus the myocardium and peripheral circulation, but some commonalities in abnormal angiogenesis can explain the well-known association between micro- and macroangiopathy. Impaired angiogenesis can also affect endocrine islet and adipose tissue function, providing a link to diabetes onset. Exposure to high glucose itself directly affects angio/vasculogenic processes and the mechanisms include defective responses to hypoxia and pro-angiogenic factors, impaired nitric oxide bioavailability, shortage of pro-angiogenic cells, and loss of pericytes.CONCLUSIONS: Dissecting the molecular drivers of tissue-specific alterations of angio-/vasculogenesis is an important challenge to devise new therapeutic approaches. Angiogenesis-modulating therapies should be carefully evaluated in view of their potential off-target effects. At present, glycemic control remains the most reasonable therapeutic strategy to normalize angiogenesis in diabetes.

The efficacy of adiponectin (APN) in regulating bone metabolism remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the role of APN secreted from adipose-derived stem cells on adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Human APN gene was transfected via recombinant adenovirus into adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) in vitro and were co-cultured with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in using a transwell chamber. Adipogenesis was inhibited in APN-transfected ASCs; in BMSCs, adipogenesis was inhibited but osteogenesis was promoted in co-culture with APN-transfected ASCs. Next, the same adenovirus construct was transfected into the abdominal adipose tissue of a Sprague Dawley (SD) rat in vivo, and then a tibia defect was established in the same rat. We confirmed there was higher gene and protein expression of APN in ASCs and the abdominal adipose tissue of these rat models. Development of adipocytes in abdominal adipose tissue was suppressed, and less new bone was formed in the bone defect area. In conclusion, APN secreted from ASCs could directly inhibit adipogenesis in ASCs and BMSCs as well as promote osteogenesis in the latter. However, APN overexpression in adipose tissue was inversely associated with bone formation in tibia defects potentially due to decreased levels of circulating bone-activating hormones.

Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) is a frequently used adjunctive modality in dysphagia rehabilitation. Stimulating deeper swallowing muscles requires higher TES amplitude. However, TES amplitude is limited by maximum amplitude tolerance (MAT). Previous studies have reported high interindividual variability regarding MAT and perceived discomfort. This variability might be one of the potential reasons of conflicting outcomes in TES-based swallowing studies. MAT and perceived discomfort are influenced by a variety of biopsychological factors. The influence of these factors related to swallow applications is poorly understood. This study explored the relation of biopsychological factors with MAT and perceived discomfort related to TES in the submental area. A convenience sample of thirty community-dwelling older adults between 60 and 70 years of age provided data for this study. Gender, submental adipose tissue thickness, perceptual pain sensitivity, and pain-coping strategies were evaluated for each subject. Subsequently, MAT and perceived discomfort level were determined using TES on the submental area. Relation of different biopsychological variables with MAT and discomfort level was examined using Pearson and Spearman correlation, and Mann-Whitney U test. Results indicated that neither gender nor adipose thickness was related to MAT and perceived discomfort. Among studied pain-coping strategies, catastrophizing was significantly related to MAT(r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.552, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.002). Distraction was significantly related to perceived discomfort level (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.561, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.002). Given the negative impact of pain catastrophizing on MAT and the positive impact of distraction on perceiving discomfort, these coping strategies should be considered as amplitude-limiting and discomfort-moderating factors in TES-based dysphagia rehabilitation.

Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) is a novel promising tool developed in several biomedical applications such as cutaneous wound healing or skin cancer. Nevertheless, in vitro studies are lacking regarding to CAP effects on cellular actors involved in healthy skin healing and regarding to the mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated the effect of a 3<U+2009>minutes exposure to CAP-Helium on human dermal fibroblasts and Adipose-derived Stromal Cells (ASC) obtained from the same tissue sample. We observed that CAP treatment did not induce cell death but lead to proliferation arrest with an increase in p53/p21 and DNA damages. Interestingly we showed that CAP treated dermal fibroblasts and ASC developed a senescence phenotype with p16 expression, characteristic morphological changes, Senescence-Associated ß-galactosidase expression and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines defined as the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). Moreover this senescence phenotype is associated with a glycolytic switch and an increase in mitochondria content. Despite this senescence phenotype, cells kept in vitro functional properties like differentiation potential and immunomodulatory effects. To conclude, we demonstrated that two main skin cellular actors are resistant to cell death but develop a senescence phenotype while maintaining some functional characteristics after 3<U+2009>minutes of CAP-Helium treatment in vitro.

OBJECTIVES: Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) has been characterized as a soluble and multifunctional pattern recognition protein in the regulation of innate immune response. However, little is known about its role in adipose tissue inflammation and obesity. Herein, we investigated the role of PTX3 in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in adipocytes and adipose tissue, as well as high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic inflammation in obesity.METHODS: Ptx3 knockdown 3T3-L1 Cells were generated using shRNA for Ptx3 gene and treated with different inflammatory stimuli. For the in vivo studies, Ptx3 knockout mice were treated with 0.3<U+2009>mg/kg of LPS for 6<U+2009>h. Adipose tissues were collected for gene and protein expression by qPCR and western blotting, respectively. Ptx3 knockout mice were fed with HFD for 12 week since 6 week of age.RESULTS: We observed that the expression of PTX3 in adipose tissue and serum PTX3 were markedly increased in response to LPS administration. Knocking down Ptx3 in 3T3-L1 cells reduced adipogenesis and caused a more profound and sustained upregulation of proinflammatory gene expression and signaling pathway activation during LPS-stimulated inflammation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In vivo studies showed that PTX3 deficiency significantly exacerbated the LPS-induced upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of adipogeneic genes in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of mice. Accordingly, LPS stimulation elicited increased activation of nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) signaling pathways in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The expression of PTX3 in adipose tissue was also induced by HFD, and PTX3 deficiency led to the upregulation of proinflammatory genes in visceral adipose tissue of HFD-induced obese mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a protective role of PTX3 in LPS- and HFD-induced sustained inflammation in adipose tissue.

In a recent study, repeated cold application induced beiging in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SC WAT) of humans independent of body mass index. To identify factors that promote or inhibit beiging, we performed multiplex analysis of gene expression with the Nanostring nCounter system (the probe set contained genes for specific immune cell markers, cytokines, and chemokines) on the SC WAT from lean subjects. Multiple correlations analysis identified mast cell tryptase and CCL26, a chemokine for mast cells, as genes whose change correlated positively with the change in UCP1 in SC WAT, leading to the hypothesis that mast cells promote SC WAT beiging in response to cold. We quantified mast cell recruitment into SC WAT and degranulation. Mast cells increased in number in SC WAT in lean subjects, and there was an increase in the number of degranulated mast cells in both lean subjects and subjects with obesity. We determined that norepinephrine stimulated mast cell degranulation and histamine release in vitro. In conclusion, cold stimulated adipose tissue mast cell recruitment in lean subjects and mast cell degranulation in SC WAT of all research participants independent of baseline body mass index, suggesting that mast cells promote adipose beiging through the release of histamine or other products.

The breakthrough discoveries of leptin and adiponectin more than two decades ago led to a wide-spread recognition of adipose tissue as an endocrine organ. Many more adipose tissue-secreted signaling mediators (adipokines) have been identified since then, and much has been learned about how adipose tissue communicates with other organs of the body to maintain systemic homeostasis. Beyond proteins, additional factors such as lipids, metabolites, non-coding RNAs, and extracellular vesicles released by adipose tissue participate in this process. Here, we review the diverse signaling mediators and mechanisms adipose tissue utilizes to relay information to other organs. We discuss recently identified adipokines (proteins, lipids, and metabolites) and briefly outline the contributions of non-coding RNAs and extracellular vesicles to the ever-increasing complexities of adipose tissue inter-organ communication. We conclude by reflecting on central aspects of adipokine biology, namely the contribution of distinct adipose tissue depots and cell types to adipokine secretion, the phenomenon of adipokine resistance, and the capacity of adipose tissue to act both as a source and sink of signaling mediators.

Bile acids (BA) are amphipathic steroid acids synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. They act as detergents to expedite the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids and lipophilic vitamins. BA are also considered to be signaling molecules, being ligands of nuclear and cell-surface receptors, including farnesoid X receptor and Takeda G-protein receptor 5. Moreover, BA also activate ion channels, including the bile acid-sensitive ion channel and epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel. BA regulate glucose and lipid metabolism by activating these receptors in peripheral tissues, such as the liver and brown and white adipose tissue. Recently, 20 different BA have been identified in the central nervous system. Furthermore, BA affect the function of neurotransmitter receptors, such as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and <U+03B3>-aminobutyric acid receptor. BA are also known to be protective against neurodegeneration. Here, we review recent findings regarding the biosynthesis, signaling, and neurological functions of BA.

OBJECTIVE: Intermittent fasting (IF) may limit metabolic adaptations that reduce energy expenditure, potentially by stimulating white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 8 wk of IF on energy metabolism and markers of WAT browning in lean and diet-induced obese mice and in women who were overweight or obese.METHODS: Male C57 BL/6 J mice were fed chow or a high-fat diet (HFD; 43%) for 8 wk before undergoing IF (3 non-consecutive d/wk) for an additional 8 wk. Food intake, energy expenditure, and inguinal and gonadal fat pads were collected in fed or fasted conditions (22 h, IF mice only). Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was also collected at baseline, and after 8 wk of IF (in the fed state, and after a 24-h fast), in women with overweight or obesity. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mice and humans) and immunohistochemistry (mice).RESULTS: IF reduced body weight and energy intake in HFD fed mice and reduced gonadal and inguinal fat pad weights in both diet groups. IF increased energy expenditure, meal number, Ucp1 mRNA levels in inguinal and gonadal fat depots, and UCP1 protein in inguinal fat in both diet groups on fed days. In women, IF reduced body weight and fat mass, but did not alter UCP1mRNA levels.CONCLUSIONS: IF increased energy expenditure and promoted WAT browning in mice but did not alter UCP1 mRNA levels in SAT in women.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophils are short-lived cells of the innate immune system that have an important role in defending against pathogens by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, effective strategies for increasing neutrophil's viability and function may be beneficial, especially in many conditions such as infections and immunodeficiency diseases. Some studies suggest using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and MSC-conditioned media (MSC-CM) for this aim. But, there is no study on using MSC-derived exosomes for improving neutrophil's viability and function. So, we examined the effects of MSC-exosomes and also MSC-CM on neutrophil's function and survival and compared them with each other.METHODS: Exosomes and CM were isolated from human adipose tissue MSCs. Exosomes were characterized, and the protein content of them was determined. Neutrophils were isolated from five healthy donors, and the effects of the two independent treatments (exosomes and conditioned media) on neutrophil's apoptosis were measured by Annexin V-PI method, then neutrophil's function was evaluated using NBT and phagocytosis assays.RESULTS: It was recognized that exosomes decreased neutrophils apoptosis and increased their phagocytosis capacity. The conditioned media augmented neutrophil's phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, but it couldn't decrease neutrophil's apoptosis.DISCUSSION: Briefly, we concluded that MSC-exosomes augment neutrophil's viability more than their function while MSC-CM increase neutrophil's function more than the survival. This report showed that the use of MSC-exosomes and CM might be useful for increasing immunity by improving neutrophil's function and survival.

Fructose may induce an endocrine dysfunction in adipose tissue in rodents. Browning is identified by deposits of beige adipocytes in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). We study the effects of the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the formation of beige adipocytes in the sWAT of mice fed a high-fructose diet. Sixty male mice (3 months old; C57BL/6) were fed two diets for 18 weeks (n=30 each): control diet (C) or high-fructose diet (F). At the 10th week, for an additional 8-week period, the groups were (n=15 each) nontrained (NT) or trained (HIIT): C-NT, C-HIIT, F-NT and F-HIIT. We evaluated body mass, energy expenditure and molecular analyses for browning and thermogenic markers in sWAT. The HIIT groups showed significantly lower body mass and increased energy expenditure. The consumption of fructose was linked with an increased sWAT mass. However, HIIT caused a reduction of sWAT mass compared to the NT groups. Energy intake was parallel in the groups, regardless of the diet type and HIIT. Fructose was related to higher glucose and insulin levels and hypertrophied sWAT adipocytes, but HIIT decreased both glucose and insulin levels and led to the appearance of brown fat-like adipocytes dispersed in sWAT with higher expression of browning markers. Also, fructose reduced the sWAT markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and beta-oxidation, which were enhanced by HIIT. In conclusion, HIIT might stimulate the sWAT browning in mice fed a high-fructose diet associated with beneficial changes in mitochondrial biogenesis and beta-oxidation markers, contributing to a whole-body metabolic improvement.

OBJECTIVE: Methionine restriction (MR) decreases inflammation and improves markers of metabolic disease in rodents. MR also increases hepatic and circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Emerging evidence has suggested that FGF21 exerts anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of FGF21 in mediating the MR-induced reduction in inflammation.CONCLUSIONS: MR reduces inflammation independent of FGF21 action. Endogenous FGF21 is important to protect against the development of HFD-induced inflammation in liver and WAT, yet administration of low-dose FGF21 has little effect on markers of inflammation.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: In cirrhosis, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and imaging body composition assessment can influence prognosis. We assessed whether adipose and skeletal muscle tissues reflect the severity of portal hypertension (PH), and whether they improve non-invasive prediction of decompensation and death.CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic venous pressure gradient inversely correlates with imaging markers of adipose tissue, while markers of sarcopenia were unrelated to PH. In compensated patients, TATI improves non-invasive prediction of decompensation. In decompensated patients, IMATI independently predicted mortality.

KEY POINTS: Oestrogen has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in both human and rodent studies. Insulin sensitivity is greater in premenopausal women compared with age-matched men, and metabolism-related cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes are less frequent in these same women. Both female and male mice treated with oestradiol are protected against obesity-induced insulin resistance. The protection against obesity-induced insulin resistance is associated with reduced ectopic lipid content in liver and skeletal muscle. These results were associated with increased insulin-stimulated suppression of white adipose tissue lipolysis and reduced inflammation.ABSTRACT: Oestrogen has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in both human and rodent studies. Overall, females are protected against obesity-induced insulin resistance; yet, the mechanisms responsible for this protection are not well understood. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the underlying mechanism(s) by which female mice are protected against obesity-induced insulin resistance compared with male mice. We studied male and female mice in age-matched or body weight-matched conditions. They were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or regular chow for 4 weeks. We also studied HFD male mice treated with oestradiol or vehicle. Both HFD female and HFD male mice treated with oestradiol displayed increased whole-body insulin sensitivity, associated with reduction in ectopic hepatic and muscle lipid content compared to HFD male mice. Reductions in ectopic lipid content in these mice were associated with increased insulin-stimulated suppression of white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis. Both HFD female and HFD male mice treated with oestradiol also displayed striking reductions in WAT inflammation, represented by reductions in plasma and adipose tissue tumour necrosis factor a and interleukin 6 concentrations. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that HFD female mice are protected from obesity-induced insulin resistance due to oestradiol-mediated reductions in WAT inflammation, leading to improved insulin-mediated suppression of WAT lipolysis and reduced ectopic lipid content in liver and skeletal muscle.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical roles during adipogenesis; however, their precise functions are not completely understood. Porcine miRNA expression profiles show that miR-127 is dramatically downregulated with age in adipose tissue. We aimed to identify the precise functions and mechanisms of miR-127 in proliferation and adipogenesis. Preadipocytes were cultured under conditions to induce proliferation or differentiation and the effect of miR-127 overexpression on these processes, and the associated bioinformatically predicted target genes, were assessed using luciferase assays, quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis, and cell staining techniques. miR-127 increased proliferation by promoting cell cycling, whereas it suppressed differentiation, which was accompanied by reduced lipid accumulation. miR-127 targeted mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 and homeobox C6 (HOXC6) to activate preadipocyte proliferation. During differentiation, miR-127 targeted HOXC6 to attenuate adipogenesis. These findings identify miR-127 as an inhibitor of porcine adipogenesis, which may inform future strategies to reduce porcine fat deposition and treat human obesity.

Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) is an essential therapeutic tool in periodontal plastic surgery and implantology. The aim of this preliminary study was to observe and make a histological and histomorphometric comparison of the composition of subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTGs) harvested from the palatal mucosa by two different harvesting techniques: mucoperiosteal (lamina propria and complete submucosa including periosteum) and mucosal (lamina propria and a portion of the submucosa). The main hypothesis proposes that SCTG harvested with the mucosal technique contains a greater proportion of connective tissue proper (CTP) and a lower proportion of adipose tissue (AT) than the mucoperiosteal technique. Twenty healthy patients who required SCTG for different purposes were selected and assigned to one of the two following groups: group A (n=10; mucoperiosteal harvesting technique) and group B (n=10, mucosal harvesting technique). The histological sample was obtained by removing a 2 mm thick slice from the most distal portion of the graft. The proportions of adipose tissue (AT), connective tissue proper (CTP) and vascular tissue (VT) were evaluated. In group A, histomorphometric analysis showed that CTP accounted for 58.2% of the graft while AT accounted for 32.64%. In group B, the proportions of CTP and AT were 79.86% and 11.93%, respectively. The differences between groups were statistically significant for both tissues (p&lt; .05). In contrast, no statistically significant difference was observed in the proportion of VT. Within the limitations of this study, the results show that the SCTGs harvested by the mucosal technique contain a greater proportion of CTP and a lower proportion of AT than those obtained by the mucoperiosteal technique, whereas the proportion of VT does not differ. Further long-term clinical and histological studies with more samples are needed to evaluate the clinical implications of SCTG composition.El injerto de tejido conectivo subepitelial (ITCSE) es una herramienta indispensable en la cirugía plástica periodontal y la implantología. El objetivo del presente estudio preliminar fue observar y comparar histológica e histomorfometricamente la composición de los injertos de tejido conectivo subepitelial (ITCSE) obtenidos de la mucosa palatina mediante dos técnicas diferentes: mucoperióstica (lamina propia y submucosa incluyendo el periostio) y mucosa (lámina propia y parte de la submucosa). La principal hipótesis postula que el ITCSE obtenido mediante la técnica mucosa contiene mayor proporción de tejido conectivo propiamente dicho (TCP) y menor proporción de tejido adiposo (TA) que el obtenido mediante la técnica mucoperióstica. El presente estudio incluyó veinte pacientes sanos que requerían ITCSE por diferentes motivos, los cuales fueron distribuidos de forma equitativa en dos grupos: grupo A (n=10; técnica de obtención mucoperióstica) y grupo B (n=10; técnica de obtención mucosa). La muestra histológica se obtuvo removiendo una porción de 2 mm de ancho de la parte más distal del injerto. Se evaluó la proporción (%) de tejido adiposo (TA), tejido conectivo propiamente dicho (TCP) y tejido vascular (TV). En el grupo A, el análisis histomorfométrico mostró que el TCP constituía el 58.2% del tejido mientras que el tejido adiposo constituía el 32.64%. En el grupo B, la proporción de TCP y AT fue 79.86%y 11.93%, respectivamente. Las diferencias observadas entre los grupos fueron estadísticamente significativas para ambos tejidos (p&lt; .05). En cambio, no se observaron diferencias estadísticamente significativas en la proporción de TV. Dentro de las limitaciones del presente estudio, los resultados mostraron que los ITCSE obtenidos mediante la técnica mucosa contienen mayor proporción de TCP y menor proporción de TA que los obtenidos con la técnica mucoperióstica, mientras que el TV permanece estable. Se requieren estudios longitudinales clínicos e histológicos a largo plazo con mayor cantidad de muestras para evaluar las implicancias clínicas de la composición del ITCSE.

The interaction between atherosclerosis and commensal microbes through leaky gut syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by impaired intestinal permeability and the introduction of undesired pathogens into the body, has not been fully elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the potential role of a ClC-2 chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, which is reported to have beneficial effects on LGS, in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. After a 15-week feeding period of a Western diet (WD), ApoE-/- mice were treated with a Western-type diet (WD) alone or WD with oral supplementation of lubiprostone for 10 weeks. This feeding protocol was followed by experimental evaluation of LGS and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. In mice with lubiprostone, in vivo translocation of orally administered 4-kDa FITC-dextran was significantly improved, and RNA expression of the epithelial tight junction proteins, Zo-1 and occludin, was significantly up-regulated in the ileum, compared to the WD alone group, suggesting a possible reversal of WD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. As a result, WD-induced exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation was reduced by 69% in longitudinally opened aortas and 26% in aortic root regions. In addition, there was a significant decrease in circulating immunoglobulin level, followed by an attenuation of inflammatory responses in the perivascular adipose tissue, as evidenced by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lubiprostone attenuates atherosclerosis by ameliorating LGS-induced inflammation through the restoration of the intestinal barrier. These findings raise the possibility of targeting LGS for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

Ethanol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed by the digestive tract, mainly in the small intestine. Alcohol is then metabolized mainly in the liver where it is converted into acetaldehyde. Two systems contribute to this metabolization, the predominant alcohol dehydrogenase pathway, and the pathway controlled by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS), which is inducible and is also involved in the metabolism of other drugs. Acetaldehyde is then metabolized to acetate, which largely leaves the liver to be converted into acetyl-CoA in other tissues. Alcohol is oxidized preferentially to other energetic substrates, leading, in turn, to a decrease in oxidation of lipids which are stored in adipose tissue.Léthanol est rapidement et quasiment totalement résorbé par le tube digestif, principalement au niveau de lintestin grêle. Lalcool est ensuite métabolisé, essentiellement au niveau hépatique où il est transformé en acétaldéhyde. Deux systèmes contribuent à cette métabolisation, la voie de lalcool déshydrogénase, prépondérante, et la voie contrôlée par le MEOS («Microsomial Ethanol Oxidizing System»), qui est inductible et qui est aussi impliquée dans la métabolisation dautres drogues. Lacétaldéhyde est ensuite métabolisé en acétate qui quitte, en grande partie, le foie pour être transformé en acétyl-CoA dans dautres tissus. Lalcool est oxydé préférentiellement aux autres substrats énergétiques, conduisant, en contrepartie, à une diminution de loxydation des lipides qui sont mis en réserve dans le tissu adipeux.

SCOPE: Targeting gut microbiota dysbiosis by prebiotics is effective, though side effects such as abdominal bloating and flatulence may arise following high prebiotic consumption over weeks. The aim is therefore to optimize the current protocol for prebiotic use.METHODS AND RESULTS: To examine the prebiotic properties of plant extracts, two independent studies are conducted in ob/ob mice, over two weeks. In the first study, Porphyra umbilicalis and Melissa officinalis L. extracts are evaluated; in the second study, a high vs low dose of an Emblica officinalis Gaertn extract is assessed. These plant extracts affect gut microbiota, caecum metabolome, and induce a significant lower plasma triacylglycerols (TG) following treatment with P. umbilicalis and significantly higher plasma free fatty acids (FFA) following treatment with the low-dose of E. officinalis Gaertn. Glucose- and insulin-tolerance are not affected but white adipose tissue and liver gene expression are modified. In the first study, IL-6 hepatic gene expression is significantly (adjusted p = 0.0015) and positively (r = 0.80) correlated with the bacterial order Clostridiales in all mice.CONCLUSION: The data show that a two-week treatment with plant extracts affects the dysbiotic gut microbiota and changes both caecum metabolome and markers of lipid metabolism in ob/ob mice.

FSP27 expression increased in lean rat adipocytes accompanied by increased lipid droplets (LDs). In SG and RYGB rats, the FSP27 protein concentration gradually increased in white adipose tissue (WAT) after operation. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), p-HSL/HSL, Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL), and Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58) gradually decreased in SG and RYGB rats, but they were always higher than in control and sham animals.

Cellular therapy is proposed for tendinopathy treatment. Bone marrow- (BM-MSC) and adipose tissue- (ASC) derived mesenchymal stromal cells are candidate populations for such a therapy. The first aim of the study was to compare human BM-MSCs and ASCs for their basal expression of factors associated with tenogenesis as well as chemotaxis. The additional aim was to evaluate if the donor age influences these features.</AbstractText>: Cellular therapy is proposed for tendinopathy treatment.

Roundup is a popular herbicide containing glyphosate as an active ingredient. The formulation of Roundup is speculated to have critical toxic effects, one among which is chronic inflammation. The present study analyzed adverse inflammatory effects in the liver and adipose tissue of rats after a subacute exposure of Roundup. Adult male rats were exposed to various doses of Roundup (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg bodyweight [bw] glyphosate) orally, everyday for 14 days. On day 15, liver and adipose tissues from dosed rats were analyzed for inflammation markers. C-reactive protein in liver, cytokines IL-1ß, TNF-a, IL-6, and inflammatory response marker, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase were upregulated in liver and adipose of rats exposed to higher (100 and 250 mg/kg bw/d) doses of Roundup. Cumulatively, our data suggest development of inflammation in lipid and hepatic organs upon exposure to Roundup. Furthermore, liver histological studies showed formation of vacuoles, fibroid tissue, and glycogen depletion in the groups treated with doses of higher Roundup. These observations suggest progression of fatty liver disease in Roundup-treated adult rats. In summary, our data suggest progression of multiorgan inflammation, liver scarring, and dysfunction post short-term exposure of Roundup in adult male rats.

BACKGROUND: Women with small- to moderate-sized breasts present a specific challenge to performing oncoplastic volume-displacement techniques for reconstructing breast defects after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). In such cases, the lateral thoracic wall region serves as a versatile reconstruction donor site. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of employing lateral thoracic adipofascial (LTA) flaps to reconstruct breast defects following BCS.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 58 female patients who underwent BCS between February 2016 and April 2017 were analyzed. Of these, 33 patients were reconstructed with LTA flaps, and the other 25 patients received BCS only and were assigned as the control group. All patients were followed up, and we assessed surgery-related complications, breast appearance, and disease recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: The LTA flaps were reliable and useful for reconstructing breast defects after BCS when the resected volume was confined to between 50 and 100 g, particularly in patients with small- to moderate-sized breasts. This is optimal for patients with lesions located in the upper-outer quadrant.

Aging is a significant risk factor for impaired tissue functions and chronic diseases. Age-associated decline in systemic NAD<sup>+</sup> availability plays a critical role in regulating the aging process across many species. Here, we show that the circulating levels of extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) significantly decline with age in mice and humans. Increasing circulating eNAMPT levels in aged mice by adipose-tissue-specific overexpression of NAMPT increases NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in multiple tissues, thereby enhancing their functions and extending healthspan in female mice. Interestingly, eNAMPT is carried in extracellular vesicles (EVs) through systemic circulation in mice and humans. EV-contained eNAMPT is internalized into cells and enhances NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis. Supplementing eNAMPT-containing EVs isolated from young mice significantly improves wheel-running activity and extends lifespan in aged mice. Our findings have revealed a novel EV-mediated delivery mechanism for eNAMPT, which promotes systemic NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis and counteracts aging, suggesting a potential avenue for anti-aging intervention in humans.

AIMS: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a common global disorder that predisposes to both Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Adipose tissue (AT) contributes significantly to increased inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) in MetS which appear to be the crucial underpinnings of MetS. Compared to macrophages and lymphocytes in human subcutaneous AT (SAT), there is sparse data on the role of other immune cells, especially eosinophils (EOS). In this study, we investigated the abundance of EOS in the SAT of 19 patients with MetS without diabetes, ASCVD, smoking or any inflammatory condition, and matched controls.METHODS: SAT EOS were quantified by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Both circulating and SAT EOS were significantly increased 2-fold in MetS and correlated with each other. Circulating EOS correlated significantly with triglycerides (TG), high-sensitivity CRP, leptin, and IL-6. SAT EOS correlated significantly with plasma glucose, TG, FFA, adipose-IR, leptin, IL-6, endotoxin, chemerin and inversely with adiponectin. They also correlated with SAT markers of fibrosis: collagen and Sirius red staining of SAT.CONCLUSION: We make the novel and seminal observation that eosinophils are increased in SAT of MetS patients, and are associated with the pro-inflammatory state. Hence, in humans, they appear to contribute to the dysregulation of SAT biology in MetS.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A Body Shape Index (ABSI) and Body Roundness Index (BRI) are two new anthropometric adiposity indices that have shown to be associated better than BMI with adipose abdominal tissue, with the onset of diabetes and the risk of premature death. Little is known about the influence of ABSI and BRI on subclinical vascular damage. The study was aimed to assess the relationship between ABSI and BRI with carotid atherosclerosis damage in subjects with arterial hypertension.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 468 patients with arterial hypertension (30-80 years old) were enrolled; adiposity indices were calculated (BMI, WC, ABSI, BRI) and carotid ultrasonographic examination was performed to detect atherosclerotic damage (IMT or atherosclerotic plaque). BRI, but not ABSI, was higher in subjects with IMT&gt; 0.90 mm in comparison to those with a lower IMT (p &lt; 0.001), whereas patients with carotid plaques showed higher values of ABSI (p = 0.001), as well as of BRI (p = 0.003). Linear regression analysis disclosed significant correlation of IMT with ABSI, BRI and BMI (all p &lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, BRI was independently correlated with cIMT (p = 0.015). On the contrary, ABSI did not show any independent association with cIMT. However, ABSI was strongly associated with carotid plaques in multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for potential confounding factors. When BRI or BMI replaced ABSI into the multivariate models, they did not show any independent correlation with carotid plaques.CONCLUSIONS: ABSI may be proposed as a better correlate of carotid atherosclerosis than the traditional measures of adiposity.

Background Obesity-associated chronic inflammation has been known to contribute to atherosclerosis development, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Recent studies have revealed novel functions of IKK ß (inhibitor of NF -<U+03BA>B [nuclear factor <U+03BA>B] kinase ß), a key coordinator of inflammation through activation of NF -<U+03BA>B, in atherosclerosis and adipose tissue development. However, it is not clear whether IKK ß signaling in adipocytes can also affect atherogenesis. This study aims to investigate the impact of adipocyte IKK ß expression on atherosclerosis development in lean and obese LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor)-deficient ( LDLR <sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Methods and Results To define the role of adipocyte IKK ß in atherogenesis, we generated adipocyte-specific IKK ß-deficient LDLR <sup>-/-</sup> ( IKK ß<sup><U+0394>Ad</sup> LDLR <sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Targeted deletion of IKK ß in adipocytes did not affect adiposity and atherosclerosis in lean LDLR <sup>-/-</sup> mice when fed a low-fat diet. In response to high-fat feeding, however, IKK ß<sup><U+0394>Ad</sup> LDLR <sup>-/-</sup> mice had defective adipose remodeling and increased adipose tissue and systemic inflammation. Deficiency of adipocyte IKK ß did not affect atherosclerotic lesion sizes but resulted in enhanced lesional inflammation and increased plaque vulnerability in obese IKK ß<sup><U+0394>Ad</sup> LDLR <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that adipocyte IKK ß signaling affects the evolution of atherosclerosis plaque vulnerability in obese LDLR <sup>-/-</sup> mice. This study suggests that the functions of IKK ß signaling in atherogenesis are complex, and IKK ß in different cell types or tissues may have different effects on atherosclerosis development.

Over the last decade, stem cells have drawn extensive attention from scientists due to their full potential in tissue engineering, gene therapy, and cell therapy. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which represent one type of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), hold great promise in bone tissue engineering due to their painless collection procedure, their ability to self-renew and their multi-lineage differentiation properties. Major epigenetic mechanisms, which involve DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA interference (RNAi), are known to represent one of the determining factors of ADSC fate and differentiation. Understanding the epigenetic modifications of ADSCs may provide a clue for improving stem cell therapy in bone repair and regeneration. The aim of this review is to present the recent advances in understanding the epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate ADSC differentiation into an osteogenic lineage, in addition to the characteristics of the main epigenetic modifications.

Defects in the gene coding for dysferlin, a membrane-associated protein, affect many tissues, including skeletal muscles, with a resultant myopathy called dysferlinopathy. Dysferlinopathy manifests postgrowth with a progressive loss of skeletal muscle function, early intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and a striking later replacement of selective muscles by adipocytes. To better understand the changes underpinning this disease, we assessed whole-body energy homeostasis, skeletal muscle fatty acid metabolism, lipolysis in adipose tissue, and the skeletal muscle lipidome using young adult dysferlin-deficient male BLAJ mice and age-matched C57Bl/6J WT mice. BLAJ mice had increased lean mass and reduced fat mass associated with increased physical activity and increased adipose tissue lipolysis. Skeletal muscle fatty acid metabolism was remodeled in BLAJ mice, characterized by a partitioning of fatty acids toward storage rather than oxidation. Lipidomic analysis identified marked changes in almost all lipid classes examined in the skeletal muscle of BLAJ mice, including sphingolipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and most glycerolipids but, surprisingly, not triacylglycerol. These observations indicate that an early manifestation of dysferlin deficiency is the reprogramming of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue lipid metabolism, which is likely to contribute to the progressive adverse histopathology in dysferlinopathies.

Bullfrog oil, an animal oil extracted from the adipose tissue of Rana catesbeiana Shaw, showed promising cytotoxic activity against melanoma cells and, therefore, has the potential to become a pharmaceutical active compound. However, there is a lack of information regarding the pathways involved in its pharmacological activity. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate and elucidate the cytotoxic effect of this oil against A2058 human melanoma cells. The cytotoxic potential was evaluated by the MTT assay, the cell cycle analysis and the cell death assay. In addition, the apoptotic potential was investigated by (i) the DNA fragmentation using propidium iodide staining analysis, (ii) the evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential and (iii) the determination of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) level. The results showed that the bullfrog oil was able to promote a time-dependent cytotoxic effect, decreasing cell viability to 38% after 72<U+202F>h of treatment without affecting the cell cycle. Additionally, the bullfrog oil induced the apoptosis in A2058 cells, increasing up to 50<U+202F>±<U+202F>13% of the intracellular ROS level, maintaining the DNA integrity and promoting an approximate decrease of 35<U+202F>±<U+202F>5% in the mitochondrial membrane potential. It can be concluded that the in vitro cytotoxic effect of the bullfrog oil in A2058 human melanoma cells is mediated by oxidative stress that induces mitochondrial dysfunction, triggering the apoptosis. These unprecedented results highlight the pharmacological potential of bullfrog oil and provide important information to support studies on the development of new pharmaceutical products for complementary and alternative treatments for melanoma.

BACKGROUND: Although several investigations have shown a relationship between increased epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and atrial fibrillation (AF), the association between EAT and ventricular tachycardia (VT) has not been evaluated.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between EAT and postablation VT recurrence.METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients (mean age = 62.0 ± 13.9 years) undergoing VT ablation with preprocedural cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were recruited. EAT thickness was measured using CMR in the right and left atrioventricular grooves (AVGs), right ventricular free wall, and anterior, inferior, and superior interventricular grooves.RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 392.9 ± 180.2 days, postablation VT recurrence occurred in 15 (24.6%) patients. EAT thickness was significantly higher in the VT recurrence group than in the nonrecurrent VT group at the right (18.7 ± 5.7 mm vs 14.1 ± 4.4 mm; P = .012) and left (13.3 ± 3.9 mm vs 10.4 ± 4.1 mm; P = .020) AVGs. The best cut-off points for predicting VT recurrence were calculated as 15.5 mm for the right AVG (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.74) and 11.5 mm for the left AVG (area under ROC curve = 0.72). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that preprocedural right AVG-EAT (hazard ratio: 1.2; 95% confidence interval: [1.06-1.39], P = .004) was the only independent predictor of VT recurrence after adjustment for covariates. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a difference for postablation VT recurrence between the 2 groups, with right AVG-EAT thickness cut-off value of &lt;15.5 mm vs =15.5 mm (log-rank, P = .003).CONCLUSIONS: We suggested a new possible imaging marker for risk stratification of postablation VT recurrence. A higher EAT may be associated with VT recurrence after catheter ablation of VTs.

Adipose tissue (AT) has wide functions as an active endocrine organ acting as a site of nutrient storage and thermogenesis. Recently it has been identified as having a key role in murine and human immunity and inflammation. Type 1 or type 2 immune responses and their respective cytokines have been linked to white or brown AT, respectively. Most dramatic is the involvement of type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in stimulating eosinophil recruitment via interleukin (IL)-13 which in turn stimulates alternative macrophage activation via IL-4/IL-13. Recruited leukocytes are capable of influencing the cellular composition and function of adipose tissue and present a route to combat human obesity, however these processes are poorly understood in ruminants. Here we have characterised the resident leukocytes populations within bovine mesenteric AT (MAT) and subcutaneous AT (SAT), compared with the corresponding mesenteric lymph node (MLN). Concurring with related studies, we find bovine AT has its own resident leukocyte populations where eosinophils and neutrophils dominate. Importantly the proportion of eosinophils or neutrophils corresponded to the adipocyte size found in both depots. Further exploration of this area may have important implications on the food production industry or could be applied to improve the course of pathogenesis during disease.

BACKGROUND: Although undifferentiated MSCs and MSCs differentiated into Schwann-like cells have been extensively compared in vitro and in vivo, studies on the ability and efficiency of differentiated MSCs for delivery into nerve allografts are lacking. As this is essential for their clinical potential, the purpose of this study was to determine the ability of MSCs differentiated into Schwann-like cells to be dynamically seeded on decellularized nerve allografts and to compare their seeding potential to that of undifferentiated MSCs.METHODS: Fifty-six sciatic nerve segments from Sprague Dawley rats were decellularized, and MSCs were harvested from Lewis rat adipose tissue. Control and differentiated MSCs were dynamically seeded on the surface of decellularized allografts. Cell viability, seeding efficiencies, cell adhesion, distribution, and migration were evaluated.RESULTS: The viability of both cell types was not influenced by the processed nerve allograft. Both cell types achieved maximal seeding efficiency after 12 h of dynamic seeding, albeit that differentiated MSCs had a significantly higher mean seeding efficiency than control MSCs. Dynamic seeding resulted in a uniform distribution of cells among the surface of the nerve allograft. No cells were located inside the nerve allograft after seeding.CONCLUSION: Differentiated MSCs can be dynamically seeded on the surface of a processed nerve allograft, in a similar fashion as undifferentiated MSCs. Schwann-like differentiated MSCs have a significantly higher seeding efficiency after 12 h of dynamic seeding. We conclude that differentiation of MSCs into Schwann-like cells may improve the seeding strategy and the ability of nerve allografts to support axon regeneration.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) inflammation is implicated in the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Dietary saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (SFAs and PUFA) can influence adipose tissue inflammation. We investigated the influence of dietary patterns, with emphasis on dietary fat type, and statin therapy, on EAT fatty acid (FA) composition and inflammatory gene expression. Thirty-two Ossabaw pigs were fed isocaloric amounts of a Heart Healthy (high in unsaturated fat) or Western (high in saturated fat) diets +/- atorvastatin for 6 months. EAT FA composition reflected dietary fat composition. There was no significant effect of atorvastatin on EAT FA composition. Total and long-chain SFAs were positively associated with inflammatory signaling (TLR2) and a gene involved in lipid mediator biosynthesis (PTGS2) (P&lt;.0003). Medium-chain SFAs capric and lauric acids were negatively associated with IL-6 (all P&lt;.0003). N-6 and n-3 PUFAs were positively associated with anti-inflammatory signaling genes (PPARG, FFAR4 and ADIPOQ) and long-chain n-3 PUFAs were positively associated with a gene involved in lipid mediator biosynthesis (ALOX5) (all P&lt;.0003). These data indicate that dietary patterns, differing in fat type, influence EAT FA composition. Associations between EAT SFAs, PUFAs, and expression of genes related to inflammation provide a link between dietary quality and EAT inflammation.

Obesity is an endemic problem in the United States and elsewhere, and data indicate that in addition to overconsumption, exposure to specific chemicals enhances obesity. CYP2B metabolizes multiple endo- and xenobiotics, and recent data suggests that repression of Cyp2b activity increases dyslipidemia and age-onset obesity, especially in males. To investigate the role played by Cyp2b in lipid homeostasis and obesity, we treated wildtype and Cyp2b-null mice with a normal (ND) or 60% high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks and determined metabolic and molecular changes. Male HFD-fed Cyp2b-null mice weigh 15% more than HFD-fed wildtype mice, primarily due to an increase in white adipose tissue (WAT); however, Cyp2b-null female mice did not demonstrate greater body mass or WAT. Serum parameters indicate increased ketosis, leptin and cholesterol in HFD-fed Cyp2b-null male mice compared to HFD-fed wildtype mice. Liver triglycerides and liver:serum triglyceride ratios were higher than their similarly treated wildtype counterparts in Cyp2b-null male mice, indicating a role for Cyp2b in fatty acid metabolism regardless of diet. Furthermore, RNAseq demonstrates that hepatic gene expression in ND-fed Cyp2b-null male mice is similar to HFD-fed WT male mice, suggestive of fatty liver disease progression and a role for Cyp2b in lipid homeostasis. Females did not show as demonstrative changes in liver health, and significantly fewer changes in gene expression, as well as gene expression associated with liver disease. Overall our data indicates that the repression or inhibition of CYP2B may exacerbate metabolic disorders and cause obesity by perturbing fatty acid metabolism, especially in males.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found in virtually all tissues, where they self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types. Cumulative data indicate that MSCs secrete paracrine factors that may play key roles in the treatment of various acute and chronic pathological conditions in diverse animal species including cattle. The aim of the present study was to compare the potentials for proliferation, migration and pro-angiogenesis of bovine fetal BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs under in vitro conditions. Growth curves and population doubling time (PDT) were determined for BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs in order to compare in vitro cell proliferation potentials. The ability of BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs to migrate was evaluated by scratch plate and transwell migration assays. The pro-angiogenic potential of conditioned medium from BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs was compared using an endothelial cell (EC) tubule formation assay. BM-MSCs displayed higher proliferation curves and doubled their populations in fewer days compared to AT-MSCs. No significant differences were detected in the number of migrant cells between BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs; however, a higher migration value was detected for BM-MSCs compared to fibroblasts (FBs), and a higher number of migrant cells were attracted by DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) compared to stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). More tubules of ECs were formed after exposure to concentrated conditioned medium from AT-MSCs compared to BM-MSCs, FBs or DMEM controls. Despite common mesodermal origin, BM-MSCs display higher proliferative capacity and lower pro-angiogenic potential compared to AT-MSCs; however, both cell types possess similar migratory ability.

In animals, fatty acids (FA) are essential as structural components in membranes and for energy storage in adipocytes. Here, we studied the relative proportions of FA in a mammal with extreme changes in metabolic rates. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) switch from energetically demanding long-distance migration at high metabolic rates to regular torpor with extremely low metabolic rates. We found that composition of FA categories differed between adipose tissue types (white adipose tissue (WAT) vs brown adipose tissue (BAT)) and muscle tissue types (skeletal vs heart), but not between sexes. We found oleic acid to be the most abundant FA in all studied tissues. Concentrations of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were not always higher in muscular tissue compared with adipocyte tissue, even though high concentrations of PUFA are considered beneficial for low body temperatures in torpor. In all tissues, we observed a high content in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), possibly to compensate for a low PUFA content in the diet. Ratios of <U+03C9>6/<U+03C9>3 were lower in the heart than in skeletal muscles of common noctules. Three FA (palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acid) accounted for about 70% of the FA in adipose tissue, which is similar to proportions observed in migrating birds, yet migrating birds generally have a higher PUFA content in muscle and adipose tissues than bats. Bats seem to contrast with other mammals in having a high MUFA content in all tissues. We conclude that FA profiles of bats differ largely from those of most cursorial mammals and instead are-with the exception of MUFA-similar to those of migrating birds.

PURPOSE: Excessive exposure of glucocorticoids activates adipose lipolysis, increases circulating free fatty acids, and contributes to ectopic lipid deposition in liver and skeletal muscle. Our previous study demonstrated that maternal betaine supplementation attenuates glucocorticoid-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in rat offspring. However, it is unclear whether maternal betaine supplementation is effective in preventing glucocorticoid-induced lipolysis in the adipose tissue of offspring.METHODS: In this study, 20 pregnant rats were fed with basal or betaine-supplemented (10 g/kg) diets throughout gestation and lactation, and the offspring rats were raised on the basal diet from weaning till 3 months of age followed by daily intraperitoneal injection of saline or 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone (DEX) for 3 weeks.RESULTS: Chronic DEX treatment significantly (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) decreased serum corticosterone level and increased proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa, IL-1ß, and IL-6. Meanwhile, GR protein content in adipose tissue was increased in response to DEX treatment, which was associated with a significant (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) up-regulation of ATGL and HSL expression at both mRNA and protein levels. All these DEX-induced changes were significantly (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) attenuated in progeny rats derived from betaine-supplemented dams. Furthermore, DEX-induced hypomethylation of ATGL and HSL gene promoters was reversed by maternal betaine supplementation.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that maternal betaine supplementation is effective in alleviating glucocorticoid-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue with modification of DNA methylation on the promoter of lipolytic genes.

OBJECTIVES: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is becoming a method of choice for the assessment of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) but the lack of robust reference ranges presents a challenge to the interpretation of VAT in clinical practice, research settings, and the athletic environment. The objective of this study was to develop age- and sex-specific reference intervals for DXA-derived VAT mass.METHODS: The reference group comprised 3219 adults (1886 general population, 42% women; 1333 athletes, 11% women) in the United Kingdom, aged 18-83 years. Total body scans were performed using a GE Lunar iDXA and VAT analyses were enabled through Corescan software (Encore version 15.0). Age-specific reference ranges were derived in samples stratified by sex and general population/ athlete status. We modelled the mean and SD of Box-Cox transformed VAT mass as a function of age with a generalised least squares method using fractional polynomials (Stata® -xrigls- program). Centile values were then back-transformed to provide reference intervals on the original scale.RESULTS: In general population samples, average VAT mass increases with age up until around 65-70 years, and then begins to decline at older ages, though data are relatively sparse at the upper end of the age range. In athletes, on average, VAT mass increases with advancing age in men and women. Both 95 and 98% reference ranges are presented in 5-year increments in all samples, and we provide equations to enable the calculation of any centile, for any age within the range.CONCLUSIONS: These reference data can aid the interpretation of VAT mass specific to an individual's sex, age, and athletic status, increasing the utility and applicability of DXA-derived VAT assessments. Additional research is needed in adults over 65 years and female athletes, with different DXA devices, across different ethnic groups and specific sports.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between early changes in muscle and adipose tissue during chemotherapy and overall survival (OS) in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of the first line NVALT12 trial (NCT01171170) in stage IV NSCLC, skeletal muscle (SM), radiation attenuation (RA), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were assessed at the third lumbar level on CT-images obtained before initiation of chemotherapy and shortly after administration of the second cycle. The contribution of changes in different body compartments to overall survival was assessed.CONCLUSION: Early loss of SM during first line chemotherapy is a poor prognostic factor in stage IV NSCLC patients. Future studies have to reveal whether early supportive intervention guided by initial CT muscle response to chemotherapy can influence the wasting process and related mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) and fat accumulation in visceral adipose tissue are key players in developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Several adipose tissue derived-gene polymorphisms are related to higher body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance and T2D. The association of omentin rs2274907 (Val109Asp) and fat-mass and obesity-associated (FTO) rs9939609 gene polymorphisms with overweight/obesity and T2D is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the association between omentin Val109Asp and FTO rs9939609 polymorphisms and insulin resistance in newly-diagnosed T2D patients.METHODS: The case-control study included 83 newly-diagnosed T2D patients and 85 healthy matched controls, aged 20-80<U+2009>years. Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were measured by the enzymatic method and enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay, respectively. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. Genotyping was examined using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).RESULTS: There are significant differences between both omentin Val109Asp and FTO rs9939609 polymorphisms and studied individuals (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.011 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0001, respectively). Both genetic polymorphisms of omentin Val109Asp and FTO rs9939609 (T/A) are significantly related to higher HOMA index (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.030 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.046, respectively). However, omentin Val109Asp polymorphism was only related to individuals who were overweight/obese. Additionally, both omentin Val109Asp and FTO rs9939609 polymorphisms were significantly positively correlated to familial history of diabetes (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.046 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.024, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Omentin V109D and FTO rs9939609 genetic variations may change insulin metabolism and have key roles in developing T2D through insulin resistance. Thus, the evaluation of these polymorphic regions may be helpful for predicting type 2 diabetes.

Numerous natural herbs have been proven as safe anti-obesity resources. Ginger, one of the most widely consumed spices, has shown beneficial effects against obesity and related metabolic disorders. The present study aimed to examine whether the antiobesity effect of ginger is associated with energy metabolism. Mice were maintained on either a normal control diet or a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without 500 mg/kg (w/w) ginger supplementation. After 16 weeks, ginger supplementation alleviated the HFD-induced increases in body weight, fat accumulation, and levels of serum glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol. Indirect calorimetry showed that ginger administration significantly increased the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and heat production in both diet models. Furthermore, ginger administration corrected the HFD-induced changes in concentrations of intermediates in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Moreover, ginger enhanced brown adipose tissue function and activated white adipose tissue browning by altering the gene expression and protein levels of some brown and beige adipocyte-selective markers. Additionally, stimulation of the browning program by ginger may be partly regulated by the sirtuin-1 (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> coactivator 1a (PGC-1a) pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that dietary ginger prevents body weight gain by remodeling whole-body energy metabolism and inducing browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Thus, ginger is an edible plant that plays a role in the therapeutic treatment of obesity and related disorders.

Adipose tissue stores energy and is the largest endocrine organ in the body, producing several adipokines. However, among these adipokines, few play a role in the positive metabolism that promotes good health. Secreted frizzled-related protein (Sfrp)-5, an antagonist that directly binds to Wnt, has attracted interest due to its favorable effects on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This review focuses on Sfrp5 biology and the roles of the Sfrp5/Wnt system in ASCVD.

Sea cucumber saponins (SCS) exhibit a significant effect on ameliorating glucose and lipid disorders by inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis; however, high cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity limit their application. Eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched phospholipids (EPA-PL) significantly ameliorate insulin resistance and elevate the level of hepatic lipolysis, which may have a synergistic effect with SCS in alleviating obesity-related insulin resistance via multiple mechanisms. In the present study, high-fat diet-induced male C57BL/6J mice with obesity-related insulin resistance were used to evaluate the synergistic effect of SCS and EPA-PL on alleviating the insulin resistance. Results show that the combination of SCS and EPA-PL at a half dose exhibited a significant improvement on glucose intolerance and systematic insulin sensitivity than SCS or EPA-PL alone. Moreover, the half dose-combination remarkably inhibited the macrophage infiltration (F4/80) to white adipose tissue (WAT) and significantly down-regulated the level of MCP1, TNF-a and IL-6 compared with SCS and EPA-PL alone. Consequently, the combined administration not only decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis (P &lt; 0.05), but also stimulated the glucose uptake in WAT and muscle (P &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, neither SCS or EPA-PL alone exhibited any effect on the glucose uptake. The combination of SCS and EPA-PL contributed to a synergistic effect on alleviating the obesity-related insulin resistance due to the amelioration of an inflammation-centric peripheral insulin response.

Obesity is a metabolic syndrome worldwide that causes many chronic diseases. Recently, we found an antiobesity effect of flaxseed polysaccharide (FP), but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, rats were first induced to develop obesity by being fed a high-fat diet. The obese rats were then fed a control diet, AIN-93M (group HFD), or a 10% FP diet (group FPD). The body weight, body fat, adipose tissue and liver sections, serous total triglycerides, levels of fasting blood glucose in serum, serous insulin, inflammatory cytokines in serum, and serous proteins within the leptin-neuropeptide Y (NPY) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway were determined and analyzed. FP intervention significantly reduced body weight and abdominal fat from 530 ± 16 g and 2.15% ± 0.30% in group HFD to 478 ± 10 g and 1.38% ± 0.48% in group FPD, respectively. This effect was achieved by removing leptin resistance possibly by inhibiting inflammation and recovering satiety through the significant downregulation of NPY and the upregulation of glucagon-like peptide 1. Adiponectin was then significantly upregulated probably via the gut-brain axis and further activated the AMPK signaling pathway to improve lipid metabolism including the improvement of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation and the suppression of lipogenesis. This is the first report of the proposed antiobesity mechanism of FP, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of nonstarch polysaccharides and obesity.

Chronic, low-grade inflammation associated with obesity and diabetes result from the infiltration of adipose and vascular tissue by immune cells and contributes to cardiovascular complications. Despite an incomplete understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of immune cell differentiation and inflammation, O-GlcNAcylation, the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins by the two cycling enzymes, the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) and the O-GlcNAcase (OGA), may contribute to fine-tune immunity and inflammation in both physiological and pathological conditions. Early studies have indicated that O-GlcNAcylation of proteins play a pro-inflammatory role in diabetes and insulin resistance, whereas subsequent studies have demonstrated that this post-translational modification could also be protective against acute injuries. These studies suggest that diverse types of insults result in dynamic changes to O-GlcNAcylation patterns, which fluctuate with cellular metabolism to promote or inhibit inflammation. In this review, the current understanding of O-GlcNAcylation and its adaptive modulation in immune and inflammatory responses is summarized.

The objective of this study was to evaluate carcass characteristics, meat quality, and organ and viscera weight of forty male sheep, not castrated, initially weighed 26.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.85 kg, and confined for 100 days (44 days for the adjustment period and 56 days of the experimental period). The treatments were four levels of replacement of Bermuda grass hay with alfalfa hay (0, 200, 400, and 600 g/kg, based on dry matter). The design was randomized blocks (one lighter group and other heavier group) with 10 animals in each treatment. There were no effects on weight gain or carcass parameters. However, an increase was observed on dry matter intake (g/day), crude protein intake (g/day), empty body weight (kg), and subcutaneous fat thickness (mm). There was also an increase in total organ weights in kg and g/kg. The tissue composition of the leg had a quadratic effect on the bone tissue weight (g) and linear effect on adipose tissue relative (g/kg) and muscle-fat relations. There was also a quadratic effect on bone tissues (g/kg) and muscle-bone relations. Likewise, there was a quadratic effect on the qualitative characteristics of meat (measure of luminosity), with the replacement of Bermuda grass hay with alfalfa hay in sheep feed. The replacement of Bermuda grass hay with alfalfa did not change carcass characteristics and meat quality.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of gastric sleeve surgery on diabetes remission in db/db mice as well as to determine the underlying mechanisms.METHODS: Thirty spontaneously obese, diabetic mice (C57BL/Ksj-db/db) were randomly divided into three groups: sleeve gastrectomy group, sham-operated group, and control db/db group. Ten db/m lean mice were used as nondiabetic littermate controls. All mice were sacrificed on day 28. The fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, and oral glucose tolerance were measured pre- and postoperatively. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related markers (GRP78, PERK, IRE-1, and ATF6), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in the adipose tissue were assayed.RESULTS: Sleeve gastrectomy significantly reduced the body weight and food intake in the db/db mice. This surgery improved glucose and lipid metabolism, as manifested by the decrease in the fasting plasma glucose level and partial restoration of lipid abnormalities. Also, the surgery improved glucose tolerance and alleviated insulin resistance in db/db mice. Sleeve gastrectomy surgery induced downregulation of the inflammatory adipocytokines TNF-a and IL-6; suppressed expression of the ER stress-related markers GRP78, PERK, IRE-1, and ATF-6; and increased the expression and distribution of GLUT4 in adipose tissue of db/db mice.CONCLUSION: The improvement in glucose tolerance following sleeve gastrectomy is associated with alleviation of insulin resistance, reduction of inflammatory adipocytokine levels, and suppression of ER stress. Further studies are needed to assess whether these effects have a causal role.

One of the most crucial branches of regenerative medicine is cell therapy, in which cellular material is injected into the patient to initiate the regenerative process. Cells obtained by reprogramming of the patient's own cells offer ethical and clinical advantages could provide a new source of material for therapeutic applications. Studies to date have shown that only a subset of differentiated cell types can be reprogrammed. Among these, keratinocytes, which are the most abundant proliferating cell type in the epidermis, have gained increasing attention as both donor and target cells for reprogramming and have become a new focus of regenerative medicine. As target cells for the treatment of skin defects, keratinocytes can be differentiated or reprogrammed from embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, fibroblasts, adipose tissue stem cells, and mesenchymal cells. As donor cells, keratinocytes can be reprogrammed or direct reprogrammed into a number of cell types, including induced pluripotent stem cells, neural cells, and Schwann cells. In this review, we discuss recent advances in keratinocyte reprogramming, focusing on the induction methods, potential molecular mechanisms, conversion efficiency, and safety for clinical applications. Graphical Abstract KCs as target cells can be reprogrammed or differentiated from fibroblasts, iPSCs, ATSCs, and mesenchymal cells. And as donor cells, KCs can be reprogrammed or directly reprogrammded into iPSCs, neural cells, Schwann cells, and epidermal stem cells.

Capsaicin (CAP) activates transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV1) to counter high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Several studies suggest that CAP induces the browning of white adipocytes in vitro or inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) in vivo. However, there is a lack of data on the dose-response for CAP to inhibit HFD-induced obesity. Therefore, we first performed experiments to correlate the effect of various doses of CAP to prevent HFD-induced weight gain in wild-type (WT) mice. Next, we performed a subchronic safety study in WT mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD<U+2009>±<U+2009>CAP, 0.01% in NCD) or HFD<U+2009>±<U+2009>CAP (0.01% in HFD) for eight months. We analyzed the expression of adipogenic and thermogenic genes and proteins in the iWAT from these mice, conducted histological studies of vital organs, measured the inflammatory cytokines in plasma and iWAT, and evaluated liver and kidney functions. The dose-response study showed that CAP, at doses above 0.001% in HFD, countered HFD-induced obesity in mice. However, no difference in the anti-obesity effect of CAP was observed at doses above 0.003% in HFD. Also, CAP, above 0.001%, enhanced the expression of sirtuin-1 and thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) in the iWAT. Safety analyses suggest that CAP did not cause inflammation. However, HFD elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase and creatinine, caused iWAT hypertrophy and hepatic steatosis, and CAP reversed these. Our data suggest that CAP antagonizes HFD-induced metabolic stress and inflammation, while it does not cause any systemic toxicities and is well tolerated by mice.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates metabolic energy and mediates non-shivering thermogenesis, thereby boosting energy expenditure. Increasing BAT mass and activity is expected to be a promising strategy for combating obesity; however, few medications effectively and safely recruit and activate BAT in humans. Berberine (BBR), a natural compound, is commonly used as a nonprescription drug to treat diarrhea. Here, we reported that 1-month BBR intervention increased BAT mass and activity, reduced body weight, and improved insulin sensitivity in mildly overweight patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Chronic BBR treatment promoted BAT development by stimulating the expression of brown adipogenic genes, enhanced BAT thermogenesis, and global energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice and chow-fed lean mice, Consistently, BBR facilitated brown adipocyte differentiation in both mouse and human primary brown preadipocytes. We further found that BBR increased the transcription of PRDM16, a master regulator of brown/beige adipogenesis, by inducing the active DNA demethylation of PRDM16 promoter, which might be driven by the activation of AMPK and production of its downstream tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate a-Ketoglutarate. Moreover, chronic BBR administration had no impact on the BAT thermogenesis in adipose-specific AMPKa1 and AMPKa2 knockout mice. In summary, we found that BBR intervention promoted recruitment and activation of BAT and AMPK-PRDM16 axis was indispensable for the pro-BAT and pro-energy expenditure properties of BBR. Our findings suggest that BBR may be a promising drug for obesity and related metabolic disorders in humans partially through activating BAT.

BACKGROUND: Acute or chronic injury of articular cartilage leads to localized destruction. Difficulties with interface integration between the implant and native cartilage tissue can lead to an undesirable outcome. To improve cartilage repair and interface integration, we explored the therapeutic efficacy of microporous acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) combined with adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets.METHODS: Methods for fabricating ASC sheets and microporous acellular ECM were explored before transplanting the constructed ASC sheet/matrix in vivo and in vitro, respectively. After the operation, distal femur samples were collected at 6 and 12 weeks for further analysis.RESULTS: The decellularization process removed 90% of the DNA but retained 82.4% of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and 82.8% of collagen, which are the primary components of cartilage matrix. The acellular matrix/ASC sheet construct treatment in vivo showed better interface integration, cartilage regeneration, and collagenous fiber arrangement, which resembles the native structure. There was a significant increase in GAG and collagen accumulation at the zone of regeneration and integration compared to other groups. Gene expression analysis showed that the mRNA level associated with cartilage formation significantly increased in the acellular matrix/ASC sheet group (p&lt;0.05), which is consistent with the histological analysis.DISCUSSION: ASC sheets promote interface integration between the implant and native tissue. This effect, together with the acellular matrix as a graft, is beneficial for cartilage defect repair, which suggests that acellular matrix/ASC sheet bioengineered cartilage implants may be a better approach for cartilage repair due to their enhanced integration.

BACKGROUND: Spinal metastasis is a major challenge in patients with advanced lung cancer, but the mechanisms in the organotropism of metastasis are still unclear. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) exhibit cancer-promoting properties that influence the tumour microenvironment; however, there is no research on ADSCs from epidural fat thus far.METHODS: In this study, we isolated and identified ADSCs from epidural adipose tissue for the first time. We examined the activation of epidural ADSCs treated with lung cancer cell-conditioned medium by immunohistochemistry, western blot and qRT-PCR assays. The expression of interleukin (IL)-6 family cytokines in the supernatants of ADSCs were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of epidural ADSCs on the growth and invasion of lung cancer cells were evaluated with the CCK-8 and Transwell assays. The expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), matrix metalloprotease and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were measured by western blot assays.RESULTS: Our results showed that ADSCs treated with lung cancer cell-conditioned medium expressed higher levels of the myofibroblast marker a-smooth muscle actin and fibroblast activation protein than ADSCs cultured alone. Then, we found that lung cancer cells induced ADSCs to secrete high levels of IL-6 family cytokines and activate the STAT3 signalling pathway. Moreover, activated epidural ADSCs exhibited the ability to promote lung cancer cell proliferation and invasion by elevating matrix metalloprotease expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells. Furthermore, blocking IL-6 can counteract the differentiation and tumour-promoting effects of ADSCs.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ADSCs respond to lung cancer cells and are involved in the crosstalk between primary tumours and pre-metastatic niches in epidural fat.

BACKGROUND: Molecular mechanisms underlying the regenerative process induced by stem cells in tissue-engineered urinary bladder are poorly explained. The study was performed to explore the pathways associated with regeneration process in the urinary bladder reconstructed with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs).METHODS: Rat urinary bladders were reconstructed with bladder acellular matrix (BAM) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>52) or BAM seeded with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>52). The process of bladder healing was analyzed at 7, 30, 90, and 180<U+2009>days postoperatively using macroscopic histologic and molecular techniques. Gene expression was analyzed by microarrays and confirmed by real-time PCR.RESULTS: Numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the bladders augmented with BAM seeded with ASCs or BAM only. Pathway analysis of DEGs allows to discover numerous pathways among them Hedgehog, TGF-ß, Jak-STAT, PI3-Akt, and Hippo modulated by ASCs during the healing process of tissue-engineered urinary bladder. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed upregulation of genes involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway including Shh, Gli1, Smo, Bmp2, Bmp4, Wnt2, Wnt2b, Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt10 in urinary bladders reconstructed with ASC-seeded grafts.CONCLUSION: The study provided the unequivocal evidence that ASCs change the molecular pattern of healing in tissue-engineered urinary bladder and indicated which signaling pathways triggered by ASCs can be associated with the regenerative process. These pathways can be used as targets in the future studies on induced urinary bladder regeneration. Of particular interest is the Hedgehog signaling pathway that has been upregulated by ASCs during healing of tissue-engineered urinary bladder.

BACKGROUND: Our previous study proved that nanofat could enhance fat graft survival by promoting neovascularization. Fat extract (FE), a cell-free component derived from nanofat, also possesses proangiogenic activity.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether FE could improve fat graft survival and whether FE and nanofat could work synergistically to promote fat graft survival. The underlying mechanism was also investigated.METHODS: In the first animal study, human macrofat from lipoaspirate was co-transplanted into nude mice with FE or nanofat. The grafts were evaluated at 2, 4 and 12<U+2009>weeks post-transplantation. In the second animal study, nude mice were transplanted with a mixture of macrofat and nanofat, followed by intra-graft injection of FE at days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-transplantation. The grafts were evaluated at 12<U+2009>weeks post-transplantation. To detect the mechanism by which FE impacts graft survival, the proangiogenic, anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative activities of FE were analysed in grafts in vivo and in cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and fat tissue in vitro.RESULTS: In the first animal study, the weights of the fat grafts in the nanofat- and FE-treated groups were significantly higher than those of the fat grafts in the control group. In addition, higher fat integrity, more viable adipocytes, more CD31-positive blood vessels, fewer apoptotic cells and more Ki67-positive proliferating cells were observed in the nanofat- and FE-treated groups. In the second animal study, the weights of the fat grafts in the nanofat+FE group were significantly higher than those of the fat grafts in the control group. In vitro, FE showed proangiogenic effects on HUVECs, anti-apoptotic effects on fat tissue cultured under hypoxic conditions and an ability to promote ADSC proliferation and maintain their multiple differentiation capacity.CONCLUSIONS: FE could improve fat graft survival via proangiogenic, anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative effects on ADSCs. FE plus nanofat-assisted fat grafting is a new strategy that could potentially be used in clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Due to its complex pathogenesis and low clinical cure rate, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) poses a substantial challenge for oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Therefore, the treatment of BRONJ should focus on prevention. In clinical studies, primary wound closure can significantly reduce the incidence of BRONJ. Whether local stem cell transplantation can promote primary gingival healing in patients with a medication history and prevent BRONJ has not been reported.METHODS: In this study, animals were divided into a healthy group (non-drug treatment), a BP group, a hydroxyapatite (HA) group, and an adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) group. All groups except the healthy group were treated with BPs and immunosuppressive drugs once per week for 8 weeks, simulating clinical use for the treatment of cancer patients with bone metastasis, to induce BRONJ-like animals. After the sixth drug treatment, the bilateral premolars were extracted in all groups. In contrast to the healthy and BP groups, the extraction sockets in the HA and ADSC groups were filled with HA or HA + ADSCs simultaneously post extraction to observe the preventive effect of ADSCs on the occurrence of BRONJ. At 2 and 8 weeks post extraction, animals from all groups were sacrificed.RESULTS: At 8 weeks post transplantation, ADSCs prevented the occurrence of BRONJ, mainly through accelerating healing of the gingival epithelium at 2 weeks post extraction. We also found that ADSCs could upregulate the expression of transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ß1) and fibronectin in tissue from animals with a medication history by accelerating gingival healing of the extraction socket. A rescue assay further demonstrated that TGF-ß1 and fibronectin expression decreased in TGF-ß1-deficient ADSC-treated animals, which partially abolished the preventive effect of ADSCs on the onset of BRONJ.CONCLUSION: ADSCs prevent the onset of BRONJ, mainly by upregulating the expression of TGF-ß1 and fibronectin to promote primary gingival healing, ultimately leading to bone regeneration in the tooth extraction socket. Our new findings provide a novel stem cell treatment for the prevention of BRONJ.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between visceral adiposity and acute pancreatitis (AP) has not been completely elucidated. This study evaluated the significance of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and the ratio of VAT to skeletal muscle tissue (VAT/SMT) in the prognosis of AP patients.METHODS: Based on a 1:2 propensity score matching, 306 hospitalized patients were enrolled in the study analysis from 2010 to 2017. VAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and SMT were measured using unenhanced computed tomography (CT). Cox proportional hazards models were applied for the analysis.RESULTS: VAT and the VAT/SMT ratio were significantly higher in the severe AP (SAP) and moderately severe AP (MSAP) groups compared to the mild AP (MAP) group (both p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Intensive care transfer, AP severity, systemic complications, and prognostic scores (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II [APACHE-II] score<U+2009>=<U+2009>8, Ranson's score<U+2009>=<U+2009>3, Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis [BISAP] score<U+2009>=<U+2009>3, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] score<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) significantly correlated with VAT and the VAT/SMT ratio in AP patients. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for VAT and the VAT/SMT ratio in the relationship of body parameters and AP mortality were 1.042 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.019-1.066) and 7.820 (95% CI, 1.978-30.917), respectively. Compared with other prognostic scores, VAT had the highest area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) (0.943, 95% CI, 0.909-0.976).CONCLUSION: High VAT and VAT/SMT ratio are independent negative prognostic indicators of AP.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical study registration number: NCT03482921 .

The aim of the study was to quantify the plasma concentration of omentin-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, before introducing insulin therapy, in relation to the plasma expression profiles of these regulatory molecules in the same patients after a 6-month insulin mixture therapy and in obese controls. Elevated plasma NGAL concentrations were found in type 2 diabetic patients as compared with subjects with metabolically healthy obesity. In turn, a 6-month insulin mixture therapy has shown a marked increase in the plasma concentration of omentine-1 and a significant decrease in plasma CTRP3 concentration in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, in relation to the values found in these patients before the implementation of insulin therapy. Insulin mixture therapy has also proved to be an important factor modifying the plasma profile of NGAL, increasing the concentration of this bioactive molecule in the plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes, after 6 months of its use, in relation to the concentration before treatment. The significant changes in the plasma profile of omentin-1, NGAL and CTRP3 during insulin therapy suggest their potential diagnostic utility in monitoring metabolic changes associated with the introduction of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients.

Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) are widely utilized, for example in manufacturing paints and in the cosmetic industry. In addition, there is raising interest in the application of NPs in stem cell research. However, cytotoxic, genotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects were shown for NPs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ZnO-NPs on cytokine secretion and differentiation properties of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs). Human ASCs were exposed to the subtoxic concentration of 0.2 µg/mL ZnO-NPs for 24 h. After four weeks of cultivation, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation procedures were performed. The multi-differentiation potential was confirmed histologically and using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, the gene expression of IL-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and caspase 3 was analyzed. Over the course of four weeks after ZnO-NPs exposure, no significant differences were detected in the gene expression of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF and caspase 3 compared to non-exposed cells. The differentiation was also not affected by the ZnO-NPs. These findings underline the fact, that functionality of ASCs is likely to be unaffected by ZnO-NPs, despite a long-term disposition of NPs in the cells, supposing that the starting concentration was safely in the non-toxic range. This might provide important information for single-use nanomedical applications of ZnO-NPs.

Obesity is associated with impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and an altered microbiota community structure, which contribute to host systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Fiber-rich common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) promote intestinal health (microbiota and host epithelial barrier integrity) in lean mice. The objective was to assess the intestinal health promoting effects of navy bean supplementation during high-fat (HF)diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet (60% of kcal from fat) or an isocaloric HF diet supplemented with 15.7% (by weight) cooked navy bean powder (HF+B) for 12 weeks. Compared to HF, the HF+B diet altered the fecal microbiota community structure (16S rRNA gene sequencing), most notably increasing abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (+19-fold), whose abundance typically decreases in obese humans and rodents. Additionally, HF+B fecal abundance of carbohydrate fermenting, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing Prevotella (+332-fold) and S24-7 (+1.6-fold) and fecal SCFA levels were increased. HF+B improved intestinal health and epithelial barrier integrity versus HF, evidenced by reduced serum fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran concentration in an in vivo gut permeability test, and increased intestinal mRNA expression of tight junction components (ZO-1, occludin), anti-microbial defenses (Reg3<U+03B3>, IgA, Defa5, Defß2) and mucins (Muc2). Additionally, HF+B improved the systemic obese phenotype via reduced serum HOMA-IR and leptin:adiponectin ratio, and locally via attenuation of epididymal adipose tissue crown-like structure formation, adipocyte size, and inflammatory transcription factor (NF<U+03BA>Bp65 and STAT3) activation. Therefore, navy bean supplementation improved obese intestinal health (microbiota and epithelial barrier integrity) and attenuated the severity of the obese phenotype.

In this study, we investigated whether supplementation of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor, can reduce the development of liver fibrosis in a diet-induced mouse model of liver fibrosis.METHODS: Male C57BL/6<U+202F>J mice were fed a low-fat control (LF), a high-fat/high-sucrose/high-cholesterol control (HF) or a HF diet supplemented with NR at 400<U+202F>mg/kg/day (HF-NR) for 20<U+202F>weeks. Features of liver fibrosis were assessed by histological and biochemical analyses. Whole-body energy metabolism was also assessed using indirect calorimetry. Primary mouse and human hepatic stellate cells were used to determine the anti-fibrogenic effects of NR in vitro.RESULTS: NR supplementation significantly reduced body weight of mice only 7<U+202F>weeks after mice were on the supplementation, but did not attenuate serum alanine aminotransferase levels, liver steatosis, or liver inflammation. However, NR markedly reduced collagen accumulation in the liver. RNA-Seq analysis suggested that the expression of genes involved in NAD+ metabolism is altered in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) compared to quiescent HSCs. NR inhibited the activation of HSCs in primary mouse and human HSCs. Indirect calorimetry showed that NR increased energy expenditure, likely by upregulation of ß-oxidation in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue.CONCLUSION: NR attenuated HSC activation, leading to reduced liver fibrosis in a diet-induced mouse model of liver fibrosis. The data suggest that NR may be developed as a potential preventative for human liver fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: The association of aging and menopause is a potent risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. We studied the impact of aerobic exercise training (ET) initiated in the old stage of lifespan in hemodynamics, metabolic, autonomic and oxidative stress.METHODS: Aged (18<U+202F>months old) female Wistar rats were divided into: ovariectomized and untrained (AG-OVX), and ovariectomized and trained (AG-OVXt, ET for 8<U+202F>weeks). Intact aged (AG) and young female rats (3<U+202F>months old; Y) were also studied. Blood pressure and metabolic parameters were measured. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was studied by bradycardic (BR) and tachycardic (TR) responses to vasoactive drugs. Cardiac and renal lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and gluthatione peroxidase (GPx), and gluthatione redox balance (GSH/GSSG) were analyzed.RESULTS: AG-OVXt group increased aerobic performance in 35%, decreased adipose tissue and triglycerides in 36% and 27%, respectively, and improved insulin tolerance in 50% in comparison to AG-OVX. AG-OVX presented hypertensive levels of blood pressure (systolic: 155<U+202F>±<U+202F>5, diastolic: 111<U+202F>±<U+202F>3<U+202F>mmHg). In contrast, AG-OVXt presented blood pressure values similar to Y rats (systolic: 129<U+202F>±<U+202F>3, diastolic: 112<U+202F>±<U+202F>3<U+202F>mmHg). TR and BR were reduced by 70% and 46%, respectively, in AG-OVX vs. Y. Once more, AG-OVXt presented similar results to Y. ET decreased LPO in the heart and kidney. In the latter, renal CAT and SOD were corrected by ET, while cardiac redox balance was partially recovered. Improved BRS was correlated with improved oxidative stress markers.CONCLUSIONS: Even when initiated after aging and ovariectomy deleterious effects, ET is able to normalize BRS and highly improve cardiac and renal oxidative stress.

Obesity and metabolic dysfunction are both correlated with increased rates of cognitive decline. However, because these two conditions often co-occur, it remains unclear whether their cognitive consequences are independent. In this review, we carefully consider literature examining the effects of metabolic dysfunction and increased adiposity on cognition across the lifespan, including only well-controlled studies that attempt to dissociate their effects. We found a total of 36 studies, 17 examining metabolic dysfunction and 19 examining the effects of adiposity. We found evidence from the literature suggesting that increased adiposity and metabolic dysfunction may contribute to deficits in executive function, memory, and medial temporal lobe structures largely independent of one another. These deficits are thought to arise principally from physiological changes associated with inflammation, vascularization, and oxidative stress, among others. Such processes may result from excess adipose tissue and insulin resistance that occur independently and can further exacerbate when the two conditions co-occur. However, we also find it likely that impaired cognition plays a role in behavioral and lifestyle choices that lead to increased adiposity and metabolic dysfunction, which can then perpetuate and augment cognitive decline. We recommend additional prospective and longitudinal studies to examine whether impaired cognition is a cause and/or consequence of these factors.

Infection control is necessary for improved burn wound regeneration. In this study contact burn wounds were induced on the dorsum of the rats and were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (107cfu/ml of saline) and left overnight (12-14 hours) to establish the infection. After 12 hours, the wounds were treated with PEGylated fibrin hydrogel containing 50 mgs of silver sulfadiazine (SSD) loaded chitosan microsphere (SSD-CSM-FPEG). On day 9, SSD-CSM-FPEG treated burn wounds further received adipose derived stem cell (5×104 ASCs cells/ml) embedded in PEGylated fibrin hydrogel. Wounds were assessed for the healing outcomes such as neovascularization, granulation tissue formation, wound closure and collagen maturation. Analysis of bacterial load in the burn wound biopsies, demonstrated that SSD-CSM-FPEG significantly reduced bacterial infection, while overt infection was still observed in the untreated groups on day 14. Sequential treatment of infected wounds with SSD-CSM-FPEG followed by ASC-FPEGs (SSD-CSM-ASC-FPEG) significantly reduced bacterial colonization (9 log reduction) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-a) expression. A significant increase in neovascularization markers; NG2 and vWF was also observed. Histological analysis indicated the wounds treated with SSD-CSM-ASC-FPEG increased amount of dermal collagen matrix deposition, a thicker granulation tissue on day 21 and more mature collagen on day 28. This work demonstrates that the sequential treatment of infected burn wounds with SSD-CSM-FPEG followed by ASC-FPEG reduces bacterial infection as well as promotes neo-vascularization with improved matrix remodeling.

BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of studies in chronic diseases have been published showing the relationship between body composition (BC) parameters (i.e. skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and adipose tissue (AT)) and outcomes. For patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), BC parameters have rarely been described as a prognostic marker of outcome. The primary objective was to evaluate the relationship between body composition at ICU admission and major clinical outcomes. Secondary objectives were to assess the relationship between BC parameters and other parameters (systemic inflammatory markers, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, albumin level) at ICU admission, and between BC alterations during ICU stay and outcomes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 25 adult patients who had two abdominal CT scans for clinical indication: first, within 48 hours of ICU admission (initial assessment), and second, 7 to 14 days later (late assessment). Skeletal Muscle radiodensity (SMD), cross-sectional area of SMM, Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) were measured at the third lumbar vertebra. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the association between these parameters and mortality.RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 64.6 years. Their mean BMI was 27.7 kg/m2 (SD = 6.0). ICU mortality was 36%. There was no correlation between BC parameters at initial assessment and ICU outcomes. We observed a negative correlation between SMM index and SOFA score at initial assessment (r = -0.458, p = 0.037). There was a significant loss of VAT between two CT assessments which was associated with mortality (-22.34cm2 / m2 in non-survivors versus -6.22 cm2 / m2 in survivors, p = 0.039). Loss of SMD was greater with the occurrence of an infection than without (Delta SMD = -5.642 vs +1.957, p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Our results show alterations in body composition during ICU stay with a loss of muscle quality (decreased SMD) and adipose tissue. These findings require confirmation in future studies but already show that BC assessments at ICU admission and BC alterations during ICU stay are important factors for outcome in critically ill patients.

In the aging population, the decrease on osteogenic differentiation resulted into a significant reduction in bone formation. Bone tissue engineering has been a successful technique for treatment of bone defects. It is reported that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have pluripotency to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. However little is revealed about the effect of the herbal medicine Asperosaponin VI (ASA VI) on ADSCs differentiation. In our study, we isolated and identified ADSCs from rats. We examined the effect of different concentrations of ASA VI in ADSCs on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium deposition, the expression of bone-related proteins and the release of inflammatory cytokines. Flowcytometry assay showed ADSCs were highly expressed CD44 and CD105, but hardly expressed CD34 and CD45, suggesting ADSCs were successfully isolated for follow-up experiments. ALP activity examination and Alizarin red (AR) stain showed that ASA VI enhanced the ALP activity and promoted matrix mineralization in ADSCs. In addition, bone-related protein OCN and RUNX2, and Smad2/3 phosphorylation was upregulated after ASA VI treatment in ADSCs. ELISA results showed that ASA VI blocked the release of TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-1ß in ADSCs. Considering this results, we concluded that ASA VI promotes osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs through inducing the expression of bone-related proteins. These findings enriched the function of ASA VI as a regenerative medicine and shed new light for the treatment of bone defects in clinical research.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Types and amounts of nutrients may influence the volume of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). This study targeted to investigate the relationship between SAT and VAT volumes and macro- and micronutrients intake among adults.METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected via a private face-to-face interview, in which diet history was obtained using validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The different fat volumes were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning.RESULTS: Participants with the lowest VAT volume had the highest intake of saturated fats, monounsaturated fatty acids and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (p&lt;0.05). VAT volume was significantly associated with the highest level of total energy and energy from carbohydrate consumption among participants while significantly associated with the lowest energy intake from fat among participants (p=0.013). There was a significant relationship with the highest consumption of total carbohydrate, soluble fiber, and insoluble fiber and VAT volume (p&lt;0.05). Participants in the highest VAT volume had significantly the highest intake of vitamin A, ß- carotene, and copper.CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of quantifying depot-specific body fat and highlights the unique responsiveness of various fat depots to dietary intake.

Progenitor cells cultured on biomaterials with optimal physical-topographical properties respond with alignment and differentiation. Stromal cells from connective tissue can adversely differentiate to profibrotic myofibroblasts or favorably to smooth muscle cells (SMC).

Obesity and associated liver diseases (Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, NAFLD) are a major public health problem with increasing incidence in Western countries (25% of the affected population). These complications develop from a fatty liver (steatosis) to an inflammatory state (steatohepatitis) evolving toward fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Lipid accumulation in the liver contributes to hepatocyte cell death and promotes liver injury. Local immune cells are activated either by Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPS) released by dead hepatocytes or by bacterial products (PAMPS) reaching the liver due to increased intestinal permeability. The resulting low-grade inflammatory state promotes the progression of liver complications toward more severe grades. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are an heterogeneous family of five subsets including circulating Natural Killer (NK) cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, and lymphocytes tissue-inducer cells (LTi). NK cells and tissue-resident ILCs, mainly located at epithelial surfaces, are prompt to rapidly react to environmental changes to mount appropriate immune responses. Recent works have demonstrated the interplay between ILCs subsets and the environment within metabolic active organs such as liver, adipose tissue and gut during diet-induced obesity leading or not to hepatic abnormalities. Here, we provide an overview of the newly roles of NK cells and ILC1 in metabolism focusing on their contribution to the development of NAFLD. We also discuss recent studies that demonstrate the ability of these two subsets to influence tissue-specific metabolism and how their function and homeostasis are affected during metabolic disorders.

Inflammation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of obesity-related type 2 diabetes (T2D). Adipose tissue-resident immune cells have been observed, and the potential contribution of these cells to metabolic dysfunction has been appreciated in recent years. This review focused on adipose tissue-resident immune cells that are dysregulated in the context of obesity and T2D. We comprehensively overviewed emerging knowledge regarding the phenotypic and functional properties of these cells and local factors that control their development. We discussed their function in controlling the immune response cascade and disease progression. We also characterized the metabolic profiles of these cells to explain the functional consequences in obese adipose tissues. Finally, we discussed the potential therapeutic targeting of adipose tissue-resident immune cells with the aim of addressing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this disease.

Background High epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) attenuation (Hounsfield units [ HUs] ) on computed tomography is considered a marker of inflammation and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Statins reduce the volume of EAT , but it is unknown whether they affect EAT HUs . Methods and Results We reviewed the chest computed tomographic scans of 420 postmenopausal women randomized to either 80 mg of atorvastatin or 40 mg of pravastatin daily and rescanned after 1 year to measure change in coronary artery calcium score. EAT HUs were measured near the proximal right coronary artery and remote from any area of coronary artery calcium. Computed tomographic images were also queried for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SubQ) attenuation ( HUs ) change over time. The mean patients' age was 65±6 years. The baseline EAT HU value was higher than the SubQ HU value (-89.4±24.0 HU versus -123.3±30.4 HU ; P&lt;0.001). The EAT HU value decreased significantly in the entire cohort (-5.4±29.7 HU [-6% change]; P&lt;0.001), but equally in the patients given atorvastatin and pravastatin (-6.35+31 HU and -4.55+28 HU ; P=0.55). EAT HU change was not associated with change in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, coronary artery calcium, and EAT volume (all P=not significant). Change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was marginally associated with EAT HU change ( P=0.07). Statin treatment did not induce a change in SubQ HUs . Conclusions Statins induced a decrease in EAT HUs over time, independent of intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. The positive effect on EAT and the neutral effect on SubQ suggest that statins induced a decrease in metabolic activity in EAT by reduction in cellularity, vascularity, or inflammation. The clinical significance of the observed change in EAT HUs remains to be demonstrated.

BACKGROUND: Hirsutism is a common clinical condition encountered in day-to-day practice. The androgenic causes account for more than 80% of these patients and include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which affects about 70%-80% of hirsute women. The second most common cause is idiopathic hirsutism. Omentin-1 is an adipokine mainly produced by visceral adipose tissue.AIM: The current study aimed at evaluating omentin-1 levels in hirsute females with PCOS and in idiopathic hirsutism.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-five females were included in this study. They were classified into three groups: thirty hirsute patients with PCOS, thirty females with idiopathic hirsutism, and twenty-five healthy control females. The participants were subjected to history taking, physical and dermatological examination. A gynecological history and radiological examination of the ovary also were done. Serum testosterone and omentin-1 were measured by ELISA.RESULTS: Serum testosterone was statistically elevated in PCOS than other groups. Serum omentin-1 in females with idiopathic hirsutism was statistically significantly higher than control and PCOS. There was a significant inverse correlation between serum testosterone level and serum omentin-1 level.CONCLUSION: Omentin-1 may be involved in the pathogenic process of hirsutism.

Tendon-to-bone interfaces exhibit a hierarchical multitissue transition. To replicate the progression from mineralized to nonmineralized tissue, a novel 3D fibrous scaffold is fabricated with spatial control over mineral distribution and cellular alignment. For this purpose, wet-spun continuous microfibers are produced using polycaprolactone (PCL)/ gelatin and PCL/gelatin/hydroxyapatite nano-to-microparticles (HAp). Higher extrusion rates result in aligned PCL/gelatin microfibers while, in the case of PCL/gelatin/HAp, the presence of minerals leads to a less organized structure. Biological performance using human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) demonstrates that topography of PCL/gelatin microfibers can induce cytoskeleton elongation, resembling native tenogenic organization. Matrix mineralization on PCL/gelatin/HAp wet-spun composite microfibers suggest the production of an osteogenic-like matrix, without external addition of osteogenic medium supplementation. As proof of concept, a 3D gradient structure is produced by assembling PCL/gelatin and PCL/gelatin/HAp microfibers, resulting in a fibrous scaffold with a continuous topographical and compositional gradient. Overall, the feasibility of wet-spinning for the generation of continuously aligned and textured microfibers is demonsrated, which can be further assembled into more complex 3D gradient structures to mimic characteristic features of tendon-to-bone interfaces.

The adipose tissue is a complex organ that regulates food intake and energy expenditure as well as induces low-grade inflammation. This review deals with changes in the composition and activity of the adipose organ after bariatric surgery, focusing on epicardial and ectopic fat and on relationships between white and brown adipose tissues. Postoperative improvements of ectopic fat and epicardial fat size and composition account for the metabolic recovery and the decreased cardiovascular risk. Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion, a proportional increase in the size and activity of the metabolically active brown adipose tissue was observed, most likely related to the postoperative rearrangement of the entero-hormonal pattern with an increase of GLP-1 production: this aspect would promote the postoperative weight loss and maintenance of post-surgery benefits.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimer of a-catalytic and ß- and <U+03B3>-regulatory subunits that acts to regulate cellular and whole-body nutrient metabolism. The key role of AMPK in sensing energy status has led to significant interest in AMPK as a therapeutic target for dysfunctional metabolism in type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and obesity. Despite the actions of AMPK in the liver and skeletal muscle being extensively studied, the role of AMPK in adipose tissue and adipocytes remains less well characterised. Small molecules that selectively influence AMPK heterotrimers containing specific AMPKß subunit isoforms have been developed, including MT47-100, which selectively inhibits complexes containing AMPKß2. AMPKß1 and AMPKß2 are the principal AMPKß subunit isoforms in rodent liver and skeletal muscle, respectively, yet the contribution of specific AMPKß isoforms to adipose tissue function, however, remains largely unknown. This study therefore sought to determine the contribution of AMPKß subunit isoforms to adipocyte biology, focussing on adipogenesis. AMPKß2 was the principal AMPKß isoform in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, isolated rodent adipocytes and human subcutaneous adipose tissue, as assessed by the contribution to total cellular AMPK activity. Down-regulation of AMPKß2 with siRNA inhibited lipid accumulation, cellular adiponectin levels and adiponectin secretion during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, whereas down-regulation of AMPKß1 had no effect. Incubation of 3T3-L1 cells with MT47-100 selectively inhibited AMPK complexes containing AMPKß2 whilst simultaneously inhibiting cellular lipid accumulation as well as cellular levels and secretion of adiponectin. Taken together, these data indicate that increased expression of AMPKß2 is an important feature of efficient adipogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Reproductive aging is a robust phenotype that occurs in all females and is characterized by a significant reduction in gamete quantity and quality, which can have negative consequences on both endocrine function and fertility. Age-associated differences in the oocyte, follicle, and ovary have been well-documented, but how the broader environment changes with age is less well understood. Fat is one of the largest organs in the body, and peri-gonadal adipose tissue surrounds the rodent ovary and comprises a local ovarian environment. The goal of this study was to characterize how peri-ovarian adipose tissue changes with advanced reproductive age.METHODS: We isolated peri-gonadal adipose tissue from two cohorts of CB6F1 mice: reproductively young (6-12<U+2009>weeks) and reproductively old (14-17<U+2009>months). A comparative histological analysis was performed to evaluate adipocyte architecture. We then extracted lipids from the tissue and performed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling, a mass spectrometry-based method of metabolite profiling, to compare the lipid profiles of peri-gonadal adipose tissue in these age cohorts.RESULTS: We found that advanced reproductive age was associated with adipocyte hypertrophy and a corresponding decrease in the number of adipocytes per area. Of the 10 lipid classes examined, triacylglycerols (TAGs) had significantly different profiles between young and old cohorts, despite quantitative analysis revealing a decrease in the total amount of TAGs per weight of peri-gonadal adipose tissue with age.CONCLUSIONS: These findings pinpoint age-associated physiological changes in peri-gonadal adipose tissue with respect to adipocyte morphology and lipid profiles and lay the foundation for future studies to examine how these alterations may influence both adipocyte and ovarian function.

CONCLUSIONS: PAAT has distinctive anatomic features and developmental processes. Most PAAT adipocytes are originated from NCCs which derive from ectoderm. NCCs are progenitors not only of white adipocytes but also of brown adipocytes. This study indicates that the PAAT is derived from multiple cell lineages, the adipocytes derived from different origins have distinct transcriptional profiles, and PAAT plays a critical role in Ang II-induced common carotid artery inflammation and remodeling.Visual OvervieW: An online visual overview is available for this article.

Regulation of body temperature critically depends on thyroid hormone (TH). Recent studies revealed that TH induces browning of white adipose tissue, possibly contributing to the observed hyperthermia in hyperthyroid patients and potentially providing metabolic benefits. Here, we show that browning by TH requires TH-receptor ß and occurs independently of the sympathetic nervous system. The beige fat, however, lacks sufficient adrenergic stimulation and is not metabolically activated despite high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Studies at different environmental temperatures reveal that TH instead causes hyperthermia by actions in skeletal muscle combined with a central body temperature set-point elevation. Consequently, the metabolic and thermogenic effects of systemic hyperthyroidism were maintained in UCP1 knockout mice, demonstrating that neither beige nor brown fat contributes to the TH-induced hyperthermia and elevated glucose consumption, and underlining that the mere presence of UCP1 is insufficient to draw conclusions on the therapeutic potential of browning agents.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that lower BMI is a risk factor for intraoperative core hypothermia. Adipose tissue has a high insulation effect and is one of the major explanatory factors of core hypothermia. Accordingly, determining the respective influence of visceral and subcutaneous fat on changes in core temperature during laparoscopic surgery is of considerable interest.METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 104 consecutive donors who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy. Temperature data were collected from anesthesia records. Visceral and subcutaneous fat were calculated by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound. For ultrasound measurements, preperitoneal fat thickness was used as an index of visceral fat. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the surgical incision to identify the predictive factors of body temperature change. The potential explanatory valuables were age, sex, BMI, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat.RESULTS: BMI (ß = 0.010, 95%CI: 0.001-0.019, p = 0.033) and waist-to-hip ratio (ß = 0.424, 95%CI: 0.065-0.782, p = 0.021) were associated with increased core temperature at 30 minutes after the surgical incision. Ultrasound measured-preperitoneal fat was significantly associated with increased core temperature at 30 and 60 minutes after the surgical incision (ß = 0.012, 95%CI: 0.003-0.021, p = 0.009 and ß = 0.013, 95%CI: 0.002-0.024, p = 0.026). CT-measured visceral fat was also associated with increased core temperature at 30 minutes after the surgical incision (ß = 0.005, 95%CI: 0.000-0.010, p = 0.046). Conversely, subcutaneous fat was not associated with intraoperative core temperature. Male sex and younger age were associated with lower intraoperative core temperature.CONCLUSIONS: Visceral fat protects against core temperature decrease during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy.

Wound repair and regeneration is a multidisciplinary field of research with considerable potential value to the management of deep and large burn injuries. These injuries lack an appropriate tissue scaffold and pro-healing cells making them difficult to heal. An alternative to the often limited autologous skin is a therapy that would restore the essential matrix and cellular components for rapid healing. In this study, we use a novel liquid dermal scaffold capable of gelation in vivo to show that it is biocompatible with adipose derived stem cells. Using a validated method of wound splinting in a delayed-healing murine model we show that wounds treated with the scaffold and stem cells had a significant reduction in wound size and had accelerated healing compared to control. The wounds treated with stem cells had increased capillary formation, collagen content, epidermal thickness and essential growth factor expression in the healed tissue compared to control and liquid scaffold alone. This liquid dermal scaffold combined with cells is a feasible treatment strategy for complex or large burn wounds that are otherwise lacking the appropriate cellular matrix necessary for healing.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic and chronic disorder, which is very common all over the world. Many genetic and nongenetic factors are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Meanwhile, the resistin gene is an important candidate in the pathogenesis of this complex condition. High levels of transcription of the resistin gene are associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, initiation and development of T2DM and atherosclerosis progression through induction of secretion of bioactive materials from adipocytes. Releasing adipose tissue-derived inflammatory cytokines is associated with inflammatory processes activation, which causes inhibition of insulin action via interference with insulin signaling, such that these disorders can contribute to insulin resistance. With the direct effect of resistin and other inflammatory mediators on vascular endothelial cells and arterial walls, the expression of cell adhesion molecules is increased. This process can lead to atherosclerosis and will result in coronary artery disease (CAD). In this review, we will explore the effects of resistin on inflammation and insulin resistance that may lead to type 2 diabetes and CAD.

OBJECTIVES: Prior studies relating body mass index (BMI) to brain volumes suggest an overall inverse association. However, BMI might not be an ideal marker, as it disregards different fat compartments, which carry different metabolic risks. Therefore, we analyzed MR-based fat depots and their association with gray matter (GM) volumes of brain structures, which show volumetric changes in neurodegenerative diseases.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant inverse, independent association of cingulate gyrus and hippocampus GM volume with hepatic fat, but not with other obesity measures. Increased hepatic fat could therefore serve as a marker of high-risk fat distribution.KEY POINTS:  Obesity is associated with neurodegenerative processes.  In a population-based study cohort, hepatic fat was superior to BMI and visceral and pancreatic fat as a risk biomarker for decreased brain volume of cingulate gyrus and hippocampus.  Increased hepatic fat could serve as a marker of high-risk fat distribution.

Alteration in cellular energy metabolism plays a critical role in the development and progression of cancer. Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue. Recent reports have shown that leptin can induce cancer cell proliferation and regulate cell energy metabolism, but the regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Here, we showed that leptin could promote cell proliferation and maintain high adenosine triphosphate levels in HCT116 and MCF-7 cells. The expression levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A), pyruvate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase subunit A and mitochondrial respiratory chain-associated proteins NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8, and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) were distinctly increased in leptin-treated HCT116 and MCF-7 cells, while fatty acid synthase and lactate dehydrogenase expression were downregulated. Simultaneously, we found that c-Myc and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 (PGC-1) protein expression levels were significantly increased. These results indicated that leptin boosted fatty acid ß-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, and inhibited fatty acid synthesis and glycolysis in tumor cells. Gene transfection experiments revealed that leptin could induce the expression of c-Myc. Moreover, the expressions of PGC-1, CPT1A, and TFAM proteins were downregulated in HCT116 cells with low expression of c-Myc, and the expression levels of these proteins were increased in HCT116 cells overexpressing c-Myc. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism in tumor cells. It may regulate fatty acid oxidation and OXPHOS of tumor cells by regulating the c-Myc/PGC-1 pathway. Targeting metabolic pathways for cancer treatment has been investigated as potential preventive or therapeutic methods. This study has important implications for the clinical therapy of tumor cell metabolism through hormone regulation.

Little is known on the causes and pathogenesis of the adipose tissue disorder (familial) Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis (MSL). In a four-generation MSL-family, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in 3 affected individuals and 1 obligate carrier and identified Calcyphosine-like (CAPSL) as the most promising candidate gene for this family. Screening of 21 independent patients excluded CAPSL coding sequence variants as a common monogenic cause, but using immunohistochemistry we found that CAPSL was down-regulated in adipose tissue not only from the index patient but also in 10 independent sporadic MSL-patients. This suggests that CAPSL is regulated in sporadic MSL irrespective of the underlying genetic/multifactorial cause. Furthermore, we cultivated pre-adipocytes from MSL-patients and generated 3T3-L1-based Capsl knockout and overexpressing cell models showing altered autophagy, adipogenesis, lipogenesis and Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) expression. CAPSL seems to be involved in adipocyte biology and perturbation of autophagy is a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of MSL. Downregulation of CAPSL and upregulation of UCP1 were common features in MSL fat while the known MSL genes MFN2 and LIPE did not show consistent alterations. CAPSL immunostainings could serve as first diagnostic tools in MSL clinical care with a potential to improve time to diagnosis and healthcare options.

The Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), a key regulator of blood pressure has been linked to metabolic disorders. We have previously reported that adipose overexpression of angiotensinogen in mice (Agt-Tg) induces obesity, in part mediated by adipose tissue inflammation, through yet unidentified mechanisms. Hence, we hypothesize that adipose tissue enrichment of angiotensinogen leads to activation of inflammatory cascades and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby, contributing to obesity. We used wild type (Wt), Agt-Tg and Agt-knockout (KO) mice along with 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes treated with RAS, ER stress and inflammation inhibitors. ER stress and pro-inflammation markers were significantly higher in Agt-Tg compared to Wt mice and captopril significantly reduced their expression. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with Ang II significantly induced ER stress and inflammation, whereas angiotensin II receptor inhibitor, telmisartan reduced RAS effects. Moreover, miR-30 family had significantly lower expression in Agt-Tg group. MiR-708-5p and -143-3p were upregulated when RAS was overexpressed, and RAS antagonists reduced miR-143-3p and -708-5p in both mouse adipose tissue and adipocytes. Activation of RAS by Ang II treatment, increased inflammation and ER stress in adipocytes mainly via AT1 receptor, possibly mediated by miR-30 family, -708-5p and/or -143-3p. Hence, RAS and mediating microRNAs could be used as potential targets to reduce RAS induced obesity and related comorbid diseases.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Angiolipomas of the spinal canal are a rare condition of unknown origin. They are considered histologically benign; however, some have the potential to infiltrate adjacent structures. The aim of this systematic review was to suggest a potential mechanism for the pathogenesis of spinal angiolipomas, along with a useful approach for their preoperative management.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review of cases of spinal angiolipoma was performed. In addition, two of the cases encountered in our practice are presented. The first case refers to a 35-year-old male patient with a history of spinal fusion because of a T9 fracture, while the second concerns a 46-year-old male patient with an epidural mass extending outside the spinal canal, who underwent fine needle biopsy and embolisation of its feeding vessel.RESULTS: From the review of the literature performed, we were unable to identify any correlation between the infiltrative potential and the patients' demographic and tumour characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: Angiolipomas are considered to be sporadic, yet theories concerning their pathogenesis include reaction to harmful stimuli and congenital malformation of the adipose tissue. Fine needle biopsy may be mistakenly considered non-diagnostic, due to the presence of well-differentiated adipocytes.

INTRODUCTION: Lipoedema is a chronic disorder of adipose tissue, characterised by disproportionate fat deposits in the lower limbs and pain with preservation of the feet. The condition usually only affects women. Diagnosis is clinical and mainly by exclusion. This disorder is little known and underdiagnosed. The objective of this article was to perform a non-systematic review of the literature on lipoedema, its diagnostic criteria and proposed treatments.METHODOLOGY: A literature search was carried out from January 2012 to January 2018, in the following databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Medline, Web of Science and CINAHL.SELECTION OF STUDIES: A total of 12 articles were included, of which 10 were reviews, one was a cross-sectional study and another was a case series.CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of lipoedema is mainly clinical and through exclusion of other disorders. There is no consensus on its treatment, but treatment focuses on attempting to minimise symptoms and prevent disease progression and the disability it may generate.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1) acts as an endonuclease that degrades selected mRNAs, viral RNAs and pre-miRNAs. MCPIP1 inhibits adipogenesis by degradation of C/EBPß mRNA and adipogenesis-related miRNA, however its role in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of MCPIP1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2-20<U+202F>weeks and next primary hepatocytes and adipose tissue were isolated. For in vitro experiments we used murine primary hepatocytes, control HepG2 cells and HepG2 with overexpressed or silenced MCPIP1. We found that Mcpip1 levels were lower in primary hepatocytes isolated from HFD-fed mice than in control cells starting at 4<U+202F>weeks of a HFD. Level of Mcpip1 was also depleted in visceral fat isolated from obese and glucose-intolerant mice characterized by fatty liver disease. We showed that MCPIP1 overexpression in HepG2 cells treated with oleate induces the level and activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>). This phenotype was reverted upon silencing of MCPIP1 in HepG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes lacking Mcpip1 protein. MCPIP1 activated the PPAR<U+03B3> transcription factor via the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> coactivator 1- a (PGC-1a) pathway. MCPIP1 contributes to lipid metabolism in hepatocytes by regulating the TXNIP/PGC-1a/PPAR<U+03B3> pathway.

Mutations in BSCL2 gene underlie human type 2 Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy (BSCL2) disease. Global Bscl2-/- mice recapitulate human BSCL2 lipodystrophy and develop insulin resistance and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The pathological mechanisms underlying the development of lipodystrophy and cardiomyopathy in BSCL2 are controversial. Here we report that Bscl2-/- mice develop cardiac hypertrophy due to increased basal IGF1 receptor (IGF1R)-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling. Bscl2-/- hearts exhibited increased adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) protein stability and expression causing drastic reduction of glycerolipids. Excessive fatty acid oxidation was overt in Bscl2-/- hearts, partially attributing to the hyperacetylation of cardiac mitochondrial proteins. Intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of ATGL could rescue adipocyte differentiation and lipodystrophy in Bscl2-/- cells and mice. Restoring a small portion of fat mass by ATGL partial deletion in Bscl2-/- mice not only reversed the systemic insulin resistance, but also ameliorated cardiac protein hyperacetylation, normalized cardiac substrate metabolism and improved contractile function. Collectively, our study uncovers novel pathways underlying lipodystrophy-induced cardiac hypertrophy and metabolic remodeling and pinpoints ATGL as a downstream target of BSCL2 in regulating the development of lipodystrophy and its associated cardiomyopathy.

OBJECTIVE: Leptin is produced in the adipose tissue. It controls energy homeostasis by reducing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. According to the &quot;leptin hypothesis of depression&quot;, chronic stress leads to reduced leptin concentration and leptin insufficiency may underlie depressive symptoms. However, it is also hypothesized that observed in depressed patients differences in leptin levels may be secondary to differences in adiposity. The aim of this case-control study is to evaluate fasting serum leptin levels in elderly women with major depression disorder and to compare them with non-depressed elderly women.METHODS: We measured fasting serum leptins levels and body composition in 32 elderly (age =60 years) European Caucasian women with major depression disorder and in 49 non-depressed elderly (age = 60 years) European Caucasian women.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.14) in fasting serum leptin level between patients with depression (3.04±1.79 ng/mL) and control subjects (2.46±1.70 ng/mL).CONCLUSIONS: In two groups of subjects with comparable adiposity parameters we did not confirm that leptin level is changed in patients with depression. We assume that changes in leptin level in patients with depression may be mediated by adiposity.

AIMS: Skeletal muscle injuries are the most common type of injury occurring in sports, and investigating skeletal muscle regeneration as well as understanding the related processes is an important aspect of the sports medicine field. The process of regeneration appears to be complex and precisely orchestrated, involving fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) which are a muscle-resident stem cell population that appears to play a major role in abnormal development of fibrotic tissue or intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT). Our present study aims to investigate whether muscle resting or endurance exercise following muscle injury may change the behavior of FAPs and subsequently impact the development of fatty infiltrations and fibrosis, two hallmarks of regeneration failure.METHODS: We used the validated glycerol muscle injury model to mimic abnormal muscle regenerative conditions in mice. We challenged this specific regeneration model with hindlimb unloading or endurance exercise and, in a second set of experiments, we treated mice with decorin, a TGF-ß inhibitor.RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that: i) muscle resting just after injury leads to inhibition of IMAT development, ii) TNF-a mediated FAP apoptosis might be perturbed in this specific glycerol model of muscle injury, leading to IMAT development, and iii) treatment with the TGF-ß inhibitor decorin decreases IMAT development and might restores FAP apoptosis.CONCLUSION: In addition to the potential clinical relevance of decorin treatment in situations involving muscle plasticity and regeneration, this study also demonstrates that a period of muscle resting is necessary following muscle injury to achieve efficient muscle regeneration which is associated with a reduction in fatty infiltration. Unreasonably early resumption of exercise brings no gain to regeneration, further highlighting that this resting period is necessary.

The recent discovery of significant brown fat depots in adult humans has revived discussion of exploiting brown fat thermogenesis in the control of energy balance and body weight. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has a key role in the activation of brown fat and functional mapping of its components will be crucial for the development of specific neuromodulation techniques. The mouse is an important species used for molecular genetic modulations, but its small size is not ideal for anatomical dissections, thus brown fat innervation studies are mostly available in larger rodents such as rats and hamsters. Here, we use pseudorabies virus retrograde tracing, whole tissue clearing, and confocal/light sheet microscopy to show the location of pre- and postganglionic neurons selectively innervating the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) in the mouse. Using iDISCO whole tissue clearing, we identified iBAT projecting postganglionic neurons in the caudal parts of the ipsilateral fused stellate/T1, as well as the T2-T5 sympathetic chain ganglia and preganglionic neurons between levels T2 and T6 of the ipsilateral spinal cord. The methodology enabled high-resolution imaging and 3D rendering of the specific SNS innervation of iBAT and will be helpful to discern peripheral nervous system innervation of other organs and tissues.

Obesity is associated with an increase of several metabolic disorders leading to the development of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This is due in part to the ectopic accumulation of triglycerides in organs that are non-adipose tissues, leading to lipotoxicity. Particularly, in the liver, the accumulation of lipids, mainly of triglycerides, leads to the formation of fatty liver. The accumulation of lipids in skeletal muscle and pancreas associates with insulin resistance and a decrease in insulin secretion, respectively. In addition, it has been suggested that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can contribute to the process of lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues, especially in the liver. The aim of the present review is to highlight the mechanisms associated with the development of lipotoxicity, and how with the advances in nutrigenomics, it is now possible to understand the molecular mechanisms by which some nutrients can attenuate the ectopic accumulation of triglycerides in non-adipose tissues. Particularly, we emphasize research conducted on the molecular mechanisms of action of soy protein and some of its isoflavones, and how these can reduce lipotoxicity by preventing the accumulation of lipids in the liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, as well as their role on the gut microbiota to attenuate the development of fatty liver. Thus, nutrigenomics is opening new dietary strategies based on several functional foods that can be used to ameliorate the pathologies associated with lipotoxicity.

A high-fat diet (HFD) is the main cause of metabolic diseases. However, HFD in previous studies consists of much lard, which contains a large amount of omega-6 (<U+03C9>-6) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and little omega-3 (<U+03C9>-3) PUFA. The role of <U+03C9>-6/<U+03C9>-3 ratio of HFD in the development of metabolic diseases remains incompletely discussed. In this study, rats were fed with either a low or a high <U+03C9>-6/<U+03C9>-3 ratio HFD singly or combined with inulin. Metabolism state was valued and metabolomics of cecal content were detected. Results show that HFD with low <U+03C9>-6/<U+03C9>-3 ratio promotes the glucose utilization in rats. However, inulin had different effects on metabolism with different diets. Xanthosine and kynurenic acid in cecum were positively related to epididymal white adipose tissues (eWAT) mass. The present study indicates the beneficial effects of low <U+03C9>-6/<U+03C9>-3 ratio HFD (LRD) on the metabolic state of rats. Moreover, xanthosine and kynurenic acid were closely related to the development of metabolic diseases.

We studied the effect of mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow and adipose tissue on the growth rate of melanoma B16 and mammary adenocarcinoma Ca755 tumors after their co-administration with tumor cells to syngeneic mice. Stimulation of tumor growth and formation of melanoma metastases in the lungs was found under the influence of adipose tissue-derived, but not bone marrow-derived stem cells. At delayed terms after irradiation in sublethal doses, the adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells also stimulated the tumor growth. Stimulation of the tumor growth by adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells was caused by factors secreted by these cells. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells to humans is possible only after accurate exclusion of malignant tumors.

Osseointegration is likely the result of an immunologically driven bone reaction to materials such as titanium. Osseointegration has resulted in the clinical possibility to anchor oral implants in jaw bone tissue. However, the mechanisms behind bony anchorage are not fully understood and complications over a longer period of time have been reported. The current study aims at exploring possible differences between copper (Cu) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) materials that do not osseointegrate, with osseointegrating cp titanium as control. The implants were placed in rabbit tibia and selected immune markers were evaluated at 10 and 28 days of follow-up. Cu and PEEK demonstrated at both time points a higher immune activation than cp titanium. Cu demonstrated distance osteogenesis due to a maintained proinflammatory environment over time, and PEEK failed to osseointegrate due to an immunologically defined preferential adipose tissue formation on its surface. The here presented results suggest the description of two different mechanisms for failed osseointegration, both of which are correlated to the immune system.

In modern societies, high fructose intake from sugar-sweetened beverages has contributed to obesity development. In the diet, sucrose and high fructose corn syrup are the main sources of fructose and can be metabolized in the intestine and transported into the systemic circulation. The liver can metabolize around 70% of fructose intake, while the remaining is metabolized by other tissues. Several tissues including adipose tissue express the main fructose transporter GLUT5. In vivo, chronic fructose intake promotes white adipose tissue accumulation through activating adipogenesis. In vitro experiments have also demonstrated that fructose alone induces adipogenesis by several mechanisms, including (1) triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production by fructose metabolism, (2) the stimulation of glucocorticoid activation by increasing 11ß-HSD1 activity, and (3) the promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through uric acid, NOX and XOR expression, mTORC1 signaling and Ang II induction. Moreover, it has been observed that fructose induces adipogenesis through increased ACE2 expression, which promotes high Ang-(1-7) levels, and through the inhibition of the thermogenic program by regulating Sirt1 and UCP1. Finally, microRNAs may also be involved in regulating adipogenesis in high fructose intake conditions. In this paper, we propose further directions for research in fructose participation in adipogenesis.

Researchers are identifying new factors that contribute to the obesity epidemic, with changes in the photoperiod as one promising risk factor. To study the influence of the photoperiod on adipose tissue, Fischer 344 rats were treated for 14 weeks with a long day (18 h light:6 h dark; LD) or a short day (6 h light:18 h dark; SD) and fed a standard diet (STD). Biometric measures, postprandial plasmatic parameters, gene expression in the retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RWAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) and histology of the RWAT were analyzed. A second experiment with the same conditions and analysis was performed for 11 weeks with rats fed a cafeteria diet (CAF). In the STD experiment, the SD increased triglycerides and showed a tendency to reduce fat compared to the LD. In the RWAT, genes implicated in adipogenesis, lipogenesis and lipolysis were down-regulated, and the histological results showed a higher percentage of small adipocytes in the SD without changes in their total number. In the CAF experiment, lipogenesis and adipogenesis gene expression was increased in the SD, while adipocytes were smaller and their number increased. Both experiments showed in the SD a decrease in the BAT expression of lipid uptake and ß-oxidation genes, while only the STD additionally showed a reduction in Ucp1 expression. In conclusion, the RWAT morphology and the expression of key genes for lipid metabolism in RWAT and BAT were influenced by the photoperiod; however, the changes observed in the RWAT were different depending on the diet.

BACKGROUND: Lipedema is characterized by localized accumulation of fat in the extremities, which is typically unresponsive to dietary regimes or physical activity. Although the disease is well described and has a high incidence, little is known regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology of lipedema adipose cells in vitro.METHODS: Adipose stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated from lipoaspirates derived from lipedema and non-lipedema patients undergoing tumescent liposuction. In vitro differentiation studies were performed for up to 14 days using adipogenic or regular culture medium. Supernatants and cell lysates were tested for adiponectin, leptin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), aromatase (CYP19A1), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) contents at days 7 and 14, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Adipogenesis was evaluated by visualizing and measuring cytoplasmic lipid accumulation.RESULTS: Lipedema ADSCs showed impeded adipogenesis already at early stages of in vitro differentiation. Concomitantly with a strongly reduced cytoplasmic lipid accumulation, significantly lower amounts of adiponectin and leptin were detectable in supernatants from lipedema ADSCs and adipocytes compared to control cells. Additionally, lipedema and non-lipedema cells differed in their expression of IGF-1, aromatase (CYP19A1), IL-8 and in their proliferative activity.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that in vitro adipogenesis of lipedema ADSCs is severely hampered in comparison to non-lipedema ADSCs. Lipedema adipose cells not only differ in their lipid storage capacity but also in their adipokine expression pattern. This might serve as a valuable marker for diagnosis of lipedema, probably from an early stage on.

BACKGROUND: Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and ceiling culture-derived preadipocytes (ccdPAs) can be harvested from subcutaneous adipose tissue. Little is known about the epigenetic differences, which may contribute to differences in osteogenic potential, between these cell types.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to address the osteogenic potential and underlying epigenetic status of ASCs and ccdPAs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: ASCs and ccdPAs were cultured from abdominal subcutaneous fat tissues of four metabolically healthy, lean females. After seven weeks of culture, cellular responses to osteogenic differentiation media were examined. To evaluate the osteogenic potentials of undifferentiated ASCs and ccdPAs, two types of epigenetic assessment were performed using next generation sequencing: DNA methylation assays with a 450K BeadChip; and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-Seq) for trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3).RESULTS: Human ccdPAs showed greater osteogenic differentiation ability than did ASCs. In an epigenetic survey of the promoters of four osteogenic regulator genes (RUNX2, SP7, ATF4, and BGLAP), we found a general trend toward decreased CpG methylation and increased H3K4me3 levels in ccdPAs as compared to ASCs, indicating that these genes were more likely to be highly expressed in ccdPAs.CONCLUSION: The surveyed epigenetic differences between ASCs and ccdPAs were consistent with the observed differences in osteogenic potential. These results enhance our understanding of these cells and will facilitate their further application in regenerative medicine.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether (-)-epicatechin (Epi) could decrease visceral adipose tissue and improve the metabolic profile of male offspring rats, after maternal obesity was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD).DESIGN: Maternal obesity in albino Wistar rats was induced with a HFD, whereas male offspring were fed with chow diet throughout the study. Eight male offspring per group, from different litters, were randomly assigned to the experimental or to the control groups. In the experimental group, Epi was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight to the male offspring twice daily for two weeks, beginning at postnatal day (PND).MAIN MEASURES: Weight of visceral adipose tissue, adipocyte size, and several metabolic parameters.RESULTS: Epi administration in the male offspring induced a significant decrease in the amount of visceral fat (11.61 g less, P &amp;lt; 0.05) and in the size of adipose cells (28% smaller, P &amp;lt; 0.01). Besides, Epi was able to decrease insulin, leptin, and Homeostasis Model Assessment -Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (P &amp;lt; 0.05), as well as triglycerides, when the experimental group was compared to the untreated male offspring of obese rats (P &amp;lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Epi administration can reverse the negative effects that maternal obesity has on the male offspring. This could be because Epi reduces the amount of visceral fat and improves metabolic profile.

Bone infections are a frequent cause for large bony defects with a reduced healing capacity. In previous findings, we could already show diminished healing capacity after bone infections, despite the absence of the causing agent, Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, these bony defects showed reduced osteoblastogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis, meaning elevated bone resorption ongoing with an elevated B-cell activity. To overcome the negative effects of this postinfectious inflammatory state, we tried to use the regenerative capacity of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (adipose-derived stem cells [ASCs]) to improve bone regeneration and moreover were curious about immunomodulation of applicated stem cells in this setting. Therefore, we used our established murine animal model and applicated ASCs locally after sufficient debridement of infected bones. Bone regeneration and resorption as well as immunological markers were investigated via histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis and µ-computed tomography (CT) analysis. Interestingly, ASCs were able to restore bone healing via elevation of osteoblastogenesis and downregulation of osteoclasts. Surprisingly, stem cells showed an impact on the innate immune system, downregulating B-cell population. In summary, these data provide a fascinating new and innovative approach, supporting bone healing after bacterial infections and moreover gain insights into the complex ceremony of stem cell interaction in terms of bone infection and regeneration.

The unabated rise in obesity prevalence during the last 40 years has spurred substantial interest in understanding the reasons for this epidemic. Studies in mice and humans have demonstrated that obesity is a highly heritable disease; however genetic variations within specific populations have so far not been able to explain this phenomenon to its full extent. Recent work has demonstrated that environmental cues can be sensed by an organism to elicit lasting changes, which in turn can affect systemic energy metabolism by different epigenetic mechanisms such as changes in small noncoding RNA expression, DNA methylation patterns, as well as histone modifications. These changes can directly modulate cellular function in response to environmental cues, however research during the last decade has demonstrated that some of these modifications might be transmitted to subsequent generations, thus modulating energy metabolism of the progeny in an inter- as well as transgenerational manner. In this context, adipose tissue has become a focus of research due to its plasticity, which allows the formation of energy storing (white) as well as energy wasting (brown/brite/beige) cells within the same depot. In this Review, the effects of environmental induced obesity with a particular focus on adipose tissue are discussed.

Obesity is repeatedly proclaimed an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and considered one of the most promising targets for prevention. This widely held view has been questioned by recent findings, which suggest that AF risk is associated with a high lean (aka fat-free) body mass, whereas fat carries little or no independent risk of AF. Focusing on these recent results, the present overview summarizes and interprets the evidence underlying this apparent controversy and discusses whether a change of paradigm is warranted in AF research or in clinical practice. The overall conclusion is that the excess AF risk in obese persons seems primarily associated with other characteristics than the amount of adipose tissue per se.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) and diabetes mellitus (DM) share common pathophysiological risk factors including endothelial dysfunction which together with hyperglycemia contribute to the increased oxidative/glycooxidative stress. A reduced NO concentration is insufficient for relaxation processes in the penis. Chronic inflammation and endoglin are involved in the regulation of endothelial function. Adiponectin from the adipose tissue has anti-inflammatory effects. Our study aimed to investigate the relation between erectile function in patients with and without DM and the oxidative stress, hormone adiponectin, and endothelial dysfunction marker endoglin. Men (n=32) with ED evaluated by the International Index of Erectile function (IIEF-5) questionnaire (17 without DM (NDM); 15 with type II diabetes mellitus (DM)) and 31 controls were included. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), 8-isoprostanes (8-isoP), protein carbonyls, antioxidant capacity, adiponectin and endoglin were determined in the blood. DM patients compared to NDM patients and controls, had increased levels of glucose, C-reactive protein, triacylglycerols, 8-isoP, AGEs, endoglin and BMI. IIEF-5 score, NO and adiponectin levels were decreased.We are the first to find out that endoglin shows a negative correlation with erectile function in NDM, but not in DM patients. Endoglin can be considered as endothelial dysfunction marker in nondiabetic men suffering from ED.

The complement system is a major component of innate immunity playing essential roles in the destruction of pathogens, the clearance of apoptotic cells and immune complexes, the enhancement of phagocytosis, inflammation, and the modulation of adaptive immune responses. During the last decades, numerous studies have shown that the complement system has key functions in the biology of certain tissues. For example, complement contributes to normal brain and embryonic development and to the homeostasis of lipid metabolism. However, the complement system is subjected to the effective balance between activation-inactivation to maintain complement homeostasis and to prevent self-injury to cells or tissues. When this control is disrupted, serious pathologies eventually develop, such as C3 glomerulopathy, autoimmune conditions and infections. Another heterogeneous group of ultra-rare diseases in which complement abnormalities have been described are the lipodystrophy syndromes. These diseases are characterized by the loss of adipose tissue throughout the entire body or partially. Complement over-activation has been reported in most of the patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy (also called Barraquer-Simons Syndrome) and in some cases of the generalized variety of the disease (Lawrence Syndrome). Even so, the mechanism through which the complement system induces adipose tissue abnormalities remains unclear. This review focuses on describing the link between the complement system and certain forms of lipodystrophy. In addition, we present an overview regarding the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, classification, and management of patients with lipodystrophy associated with complement abnormalities.

Alterations in amino acid and protein metabolism-particularly in skeletal muscle-are a key feature of cancer that contribute to the cachexia syndrome. Thus, skeletal muscle protein turnover is characterized by an exacerbated rate of protein degradation, promoted by an activation of different proteolytic systems that include the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagic-lysosomal pathways. These changes are promoted by both hormonal alterations and inflammatory mediators released as a result of the systemic inflammatory response induced by the tumor. Other events, such as alterations in the rate of myogenesis/apoptosis and decreased regeneration potential also affect skeletal muscle in patients with cancer. Mitochondrial dysfunction also contributes to changes in skeletal muscle metabolism and further contributes to the exacerbation of the cancer-wasting syndrome. Different inflammatory mediators-either released by the tumor or by the patient's healthy cells-are responsible for the activation of these catabolic processes that take place in skeletal muscle and in other tissues/organs, such as liver or adipose tissues. Indeed, white adipose tissue is also subject to extensive wasting and &quot;browning&quot; of some of the white adipocytes into beige cells; therefore increasing the energetic inefficiency of the patient with cancer. Recently, an interest in the role of micromRNAs-either free or transported into exosomes-has been related to the events that take place in white adipose tissue during cancer cachexia.

OBJECTIVE: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely prescribed medications that are well recognized to cause adverse metabolic effects including hyperphagia, obesity, and hyperglycemia. These effects have been recapitulated in a murine model of GC excess, and we hypothesize that they are mediated, in part, through central mechanisms. This study aimed to identify genes in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) that are altered with GC treatment and evaluate their contribution to GC-induced metabolic abnormalities.METHODS: Corticosterone (Cort; 75 µg/ml) was administered in the drinking water to male C57Bl/6J mice for 2 days or 4 weeks. Phenotypic analysis of each group was undertaken and central and peripheral tissues were collected for biochemical and mRNA analyses. Arcuate nuclei were isolated by laser capture microdissection and tissue analyzed by RNA-seq.RESULTS: RNA-seq analysis of ARC tissue from 4 week Cort treated mice revealed 21 upregulated and 22 downregulated genes at a time when mice had increased food intake, expansion of adipose tissue mass, and insulin resistance. In comparison, after 2 days Cort treatment, when the main phenotypic change was increased food intake, RNA-seq identified 30 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes. Within the genes altered at 2 days were a range of novel genes but also those known to be regulated by GCs, including Fkbp5, Mt2, Fam107a, as well as some involved in the control of energy balance, such as Agrp, Sepp1, Dio2, and Nmb. Of the candidate genes identified by RNA-seq, type-II iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) was chosen for further investigation as it was increased (2-fold) with Cort, and has been implicated in the control of energy balance via the modulation of hypothalamic thyroid hormone availability. Targeted knockdown of Dio2 in the MBH using AAV-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 produced a mild attenuation in GC-induced brown adipose tissue weight gain, as well as a 56% reduction in the GC-induced increase in Agrp. However, this conferred no protection from GC-induced hyperphagia, obesity, or hyperglycemia.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a comprehensive set of genes altered by GCs in the ARC and enabled the selection of key candidate genes. Targeted knockdown of hypothalamic Dio2 revealed that it did not mediate the chronic GC effects on hyperphagia and hyperglycemia.

Intermitted fasting or every-other-day feeding (EOD) has many positive effects in rodents and humans. Our goal was to describe how EOD influences bone mineral composition in female and male mice under prolonged EOD feeding. Male and female adult mice were fed EOD for 9 months. After this time, we used a direct method of measurement of mineral components in ashes of long bones (humerus and radius) to estimate the content of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na). We also performed histological analysis of sections of long bones. We found no significant changes in mineral composition between ad libitum and EOD fed males and females. We noted higher Ca and P contents in control males vs. females and lower content of Mg in control males vs. females. We observed the presence of marrow adipose tissue (MAT) in sections of EOD-fed females. EOD without supplementation during feeding days did not increase loss of mineral content of bones in C57BL/6J mice, but the presence of MAT only in EOD females indicates a gender-dependent response to EOD treatment in C57BL/6J mice.

FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) is a regulator of metabolism and performs an important role in glucose and lipid metabolism and the maintenance of energy balance. FGF21 is principally expressed in the liver, but it can also be found in the pancreas, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. It is known that levels of serum FGF21 are significantly elevated in obese, insulin-resistant patients, and those with metabolic syndrome. Elevated levels of FGF21 in serum during the early stages of various metabolic diseases are considered a compensatory response by the organism. Therefore, FGF21 is considered a hormone in response to stress and an early diagnostic marker of disease. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a special type of cardiac complication, characterized as a chronic myocardial disorder caused by diabetes. The pathological process includes increased oxidative stress, energy metabolism in myocardial cells, an inflammatory response, and myocardial cell apoptosis. A growing body of evidence suggests that FGF21 has the potential to be an effective drug for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Here, we review recent progress on the characteristics of FGF21 in its protective role, especially in pathological processes such as suppressing apoptosis in the myocardium, reducing inflammation in cardiomyocytes, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting fatty acid oxidation. In addition, we explore the possibility that diabetic cardiomyopathy can be delayed through the application of FGF21, providing possible therapeutic targets of the disease.

INTRODUCTION: Sarcopenia is characterized by progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, which results in decreased muscle strength, functional impairment, and increased risk of death. Few studies have performed a concomitant evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and body composition variables to accurately determine the contribution of each parameter to low muscle mass (LMM) in older subjects. This study aimed to identify risk factors (clinical, laboratory parameters, BMD, and body composition by DXA including visceral fat) for LMM in a prospective cohort of older Brazilian women.METHODS: A total of 408 women aged =65 yr from the São Paulo Ageing &amp; Health study were evaluated with clinical data, laboratory bone tests, BMD, and body composition by DXA using Hologic QDR 4500A equipment. Risk factors were measured at baseline (2005-2007). After a follow-up of 4.3 ± 0.8 yr, subjects were classified according to the LMM definition of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health criteria. LMM was defined when appendicular lean mass divided by body mass index was less than 0.512. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for LMM.CONCLUSIONS: Falls, high TSH, low creatinine, and high VAT were risk factors for LMM in older women. More attention should be paid to these factors, since they are potentially reversible with adequate intervention.

Plastics are ubiquitously present in our daily life and some components of plastics are endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A and phthalates. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effect of plastic endocrine disruptors on type 1 and type 2 deiodinase activities, enzymes responsible for the conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the biologically active thyroid hormone T3, both in vitro and in vivo. Initially, we incubated rat liver type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase samples with 0.5 mM of the plasticizers, and the deiodinase activity was measured. Among them, only BPA was capable to inhibit both type 1 and type 2 deiodinases. Then, adult male Wistar rats were treated orally with bisphenol A (40<U+2009>mg/kg b.w.) for 15 days and hepatic type 1 deiodinase and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activities and serum thyroid hormone concentrations were measured. In vivo bisphenol A treatment significantly reduced hepatic type 1 deiodinase activity but did not affect brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase activity. Serum T4 levels were higher in bisphenol A group, while T3 remained unchanged. T3/T4 ratio was decreased in rats treated with bisphenol A, reinforcing the idea that peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormone was affected by bisphenol A exposure. Therefore, our results suggest that bisphenol A can affect the metabolism of thyroid hormone thus disrupting thyroid signaling.

Heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) belongs to a family of intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins that are involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids. Previous studies have indicated that H-FABP is significantly associated with intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pig. In this study, we compared the mRNA and protein expression of H-FABP between Tibetan pig (with high IMF) and Large White pig (with low IMF). The expression of H-FABP at both mRNA and protein levels in the tissues of backfat, longissimus dorsi muscle and liver was found to be significantly higher in TP than in LW. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 2<U+202F>kb region upstream of the start codon of the gene were screened using Sanger sequencing. We accordingly identified three SNPs (C-1375G, C-314T and T-158G) between the TP and LW populations and genotyped these based on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCF-RFLPs) analysis. The results showed that the C-1375G site might regulate H-FABP gene expression and thus be associated with fat deposition in pigs. Our study provides important data for further investigating the regulatory mechanism of H-FABP for fat deposition in pigs.

Intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) treatment induces bone anabolic effects that result in the recovery of osteoporotic bone loss. Human PTH is usually given to osteoporotic patients because it induces osteoblastogenesis. However, the mechanism by which PTH stimulates the expansion of stromal cell populations and their maturation toward the osteoblastic cell lineage has not be elucidated. Mouse genetic lineage tracing revealed that iPTH treatment induced osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs), which carried the leptin receptor (LepR)-Cre. Although these findings suggested that part of the PTH-induced bone anabolic action is exerted because of osteoblastic commitment of MSPCs, little is known about the in vivo mechanistic details of these processes. Here, we showed that LepR<sup>+</sup> MSPCs differentiated into type I collagen (Col1)<sup>+</sup> mature osteoblasts in response to iPTH treatment. Along with osteoblastogenesis, the number of Col1<sup>+</sup> mature osteoblasts increased around the bone surface, although most of them were characterized as quiescent cells. However, the number of LepR-Cre-marked lineage cells in a proliferative state also increased in the vicinity of bone tissue after iPTH treatment. The expression levels of SP7/osterix (Osx) and Col1, which are markers for osteoblasts, were also increased in the LepR<sup>+</sup> MSPCs population in response to iPTH treatment. In contrast, the expression levels of Cebpb, Pparg, and Zfp467, which are adipocyte markers, decreased in this population. Consistent with these results, iPTH treatment inhibited 5-fluorouracil- or ovariectomy (OVX)-induced LepR<sup>+</sup> MSPC-derived adipogenesis in BM and increased LepR<sup>+</sup> MSPC-derived osteoblasts, even under the adipocyte-induced conditions. Treatment of OVX rats with iPTH significantly affected the osteoporotic bone tissue and expansion of the BM adipose tissue. These results indicated that iPTH treatment induced transient proliferation of the LepR<sup>+</sup> MSPCs and skewed their lineage differentiation from adipocytes toward osteoblasts, resulting in an expanded, quiescent, and mature osteoblast population. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the thickness of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and the adipokine-cytokine profile of patients with coronary heart disease, which can be of significant importance for predicting the course of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Eighty-four patients with CVD were assessed and divided into two groups based on the presence of visceral obesity (VO). In patients with VO, the thickness of the epicardial deposits of the left and right ventricles were 1.75 and 1.43 times greater, respectively, than in patients without VO. For patients with VO, the prevalence of the volume of the left anterior descending artery was 10% higher, and the middle third of the envelope artery was 28% higher, when compared to patients without VO. When evaluating inflammatory status, it was established that the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-1ß, and leptin in the blood serum of patients with VO exceeded the values of patients without VO. The level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was 2-times lower in patients with VO. The findings of this study show that increased EAT and PVAT are independent risk factors of CVD, as well as a possible model for the assessment of drug effectiveness for CVD.

Obesity is characterised by imbalance in lipid metabolism manifested by high concentrations of circulating triacylglycerols and total cholesterol as well as low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Abnormalities related to these lipids lead to metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive research, it is still unclear why a subset of obese subjects develop metabolic syndrome, while others do not. The aim of our work was to assess total and plasma membrane expressions of cholesterol transport proteins: adipocyte ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), adipocyte ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1), class B scavenger receptor (SR-BI) in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese subjects with and without metabolic syndrome. To keep our preliminary study group uniform, we focused on women, who constitute the majority of bariatric patients. The study was performed on 34 patients: 24 morbidly obese women subjected to bariatric surgery, half of whom had metabolic syndrome; and 10 lean subjects undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Total and plasma membrane expressions of cholesterol transport proteins (SR-BI, ABCA1 and ABCG1) were assessed in samples of both visceral and subcutaneous adipose and analysed in relation to other clinical and laboratory parameters. We demonstrated lower plasma membrane expressions of ABCG1 in visceral adipose tissue of obese patients with metabolic syndrome as compared to lean ones. In addition, total ABCG1 expressions in both types of adipose tissue were lower in morbidly obese patients with metabolic syndrome compared to those without metabolic syndrome. Plasma membrane ABCA1 expressions in visceral adipose tissue were lower in the group of morbidly obese patients without metabolic syndrome, compared to lean patients. We did not find any significant differences in SR-BI expressions. Because of ABCG1 is responsible for cholesterol efflux to HDL, reduced plasma membrane expression of ABCG1 in VAT of morbidly obese women with metabolic syndrome may leads to a significantly decreased concentration of HDL in serum. This may be also confirmed by high positive correlation between both parameters.

The relationship between abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (aSAT), body fat percentage (BFP), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) and outcome measures of neurological deficit and functional recovery was evaluated in obese subacute stroke patients before and after neurorehabilitation. Decreased National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (p = 0.0001) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (p= 0.002) scores, as well as increased Barthel Index (p= 0.0001) scores were detected after neurorehabilitation. Decreased BMI, aSAT, BFP and WHR observed after neurorehabilitation did not penalize the overall functional recovery as shown by correlations between the clinical measure scores and fat mass indices. The correlation observed after neurorehabilitation between BMI and mRS (rho = 0.4526, p &lt; 0.05) suggests that a high BMI may compromise functional recovery. Monitoring of body fat mass indices may provide information aimed at improving the disability of obese stroke patients.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer cells recruit surrounding stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), to remodel collagen and promote tumor metastasis. Adipocytes are the most abundant stromal partners in breast tissue, local invasion of breast cancer leads to the proximity of cancer cells and adipocytes, which respond to generate cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs). These cells exhibit enhanced secretion of extracellular matrix related proteins, including collagens. However, the role of adipocyte-derived collagen on breast cancer progression still remains unclear.METHODS: Adipocytes were cocultured with breast cancer cells for 3D collagen invasion and collagen organization exploration. Breast cancer cells and adipose tissue co- implanted mouse model, clinical breast cancer samples analysis were used to study the crosstalk between adipose and breast cancer cells in vivo. A combination of proteomics, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, loss of function assay, qPCR, western blot, database analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to study the mechanism mediated the activation of PLOD2 in adipocytes.RESULTS: It was found that CAAs remodeled collagen alignment during crosstalk with breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, which further promoted breast cancer metastasis. Tumor-derived PAI-1 was required to activate the expression of the intracellular enzyme procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2) in CAAs. Pharmacologic blockade of PAI-1 or PLOD2 disrupted the collagen reorganization in CAAs. Mechanistically, it was observed that PI3K/AKT pathway was activated in adipocytes upon co-culturing with breast cancer cells or treatment with recombinant PAI-1, which could promote the translocation of transcription factor FOXP1 into the nucleus and further enhanced the promoter activity of PLOD2 in CAAs. In addition, collagen reorganization at the tumor-adipose periphery, as well as the positive relevance between PAI-1 and PLOD2 in invasive breast carcinoma were confirmed in clinical specimens of breast cancer.CONCLUSION: In summary, our findings revealed a new stromal collagen network that favors tumor invasion and metastasis establish between breast cancer cells and surrounding adipocytes at the tumor invasive front, and identified PLOD2 as a therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with insulin resistance, which may lead to type 2 diabetes and its complications. Although HCV infects mainly hepatocytes, it may impair insulin sensitivity at the level of uninfected extrahepatic tissues (muscles and adipose tissue). The aim of this study was to assess whether an interferon-free, antiviral therapy may improve HCV-associated hepatic vs. peripheral insulin sensitivity.METHODS: In a single-arm exploratory trial, 17 non-diabetic, lean chronic hepatitis C patients without significant fibrosis were enrolled, and 12 completed the study. Patients were treated with a combination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks, and were submitted to a 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with tracers, together with indirect calorimetry measurement, to measure insulin sensitivity before and after 6 weeks of antivirals. A panel of 27 metabolically active cytokines was analyzed at baseline and after therapy-induced viral suppression.RESULTS: Clamp analysis performed in 12 patients who achieved complete viral suppression after 6 weeks of therapy showed a significant improvement of the peripheral insulin sensitivity (13.1% [4.6-36.7], p = 0.003), whereas no difference was observed neither in the endogenous glucose production, in lipolysis suppression nor in substrate oxidation. A distinct subset of hepatokines, potentially involved in liver-to-periphery crosstalk, was modified by the antiviral therapy.CONCLUSION: Pharmacological inhibition of HCV improves peripheral (but not hepatic) insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic, lean individuals with chronic hepatitis C without significant fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: Patients requiring posterior lumbar surgery have increased annually. Incision infection after lumbar surgery has serious consequences for patients. However, data on the related factors of incision infection after lumbar surgery in diabetic patients are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze diabetic patients who underwent lumbar surgery and to explore the risk factors of perioperative incision infection to provide a scientific basis for perioperative intervention of lumbar spine surgery and reduce risk of incision infection in such patients.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of diabetic patients who underwent posterior lumbar surgery from 2011 to 2016. A total of 523 diabetic patients undergoing posterior lumbar surgery were analyzed for the influence of various risk factors on postoperative incision infection. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. The test level was a=.05, and P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: In the past 6 years, among the 523 diabetic patients, the incidence of incision infection after posterior lumbar surgery was approximately 7.1%, of which the shallow incision infection rate was 4.2% and the deep incision infection rate was 2.9%. Incision infection of posterior lumbar surgery in diabetic patients is related to smoking, preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, postoperative albumin (Alb), surgical segment, operation time, and intraoperative blood loss, especially on postoperative fasting blood glucose, postoperative postprandial blood glucose, local subcutaneous fat thickness, and operation sequence (odds ratio &gt;5.00). Meanwhile, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), preoperative Alb, and newly diagnosed diabetes were not highly correlated with incision infection after posterior lumbar surgery.CONCLUSION: Local subcutaneous fat thickness is a better indicator for predicting incision infection compared with BMI. In diabetic patients undergoing lumbar surgery, actively controlling blood glucose fluctuations, restoring normal diet early after surgery, and optimizing surgical procedures to reduce trauma and operative time can effectively reduce the risk of infection after posterior lumbar surgery.

Non-invasive body contouring is a rapidly growing field in cosmetic dermatology. Non-invasive contouring devices improve the body's appearance through the removal of excess adipose tissue, particularly in areas in which fat persists despite optimal diet and exercise routine. The technology can also be used for skin tightening. This article reviews the five FDA-approved non-invasive body contouring modalities: cryolipolysis, laser, high-intensity focused electromagnetic field, radiofrequency and high-intensity focused ultrasound. These devices have emerged as a popular alternative to surgical body contouring due to their efficacy, favourable safety profile, minimal recovery time and reduced cost. Although they do not achieve the same results as liposuction, they are an attractive alternative for patients who do not want the risks or costs associated with surgery. When used appropriately and correctly, these devices have demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy and safety.

The consumption of diets rich in fat and refined sugars is recognized to be one of the causes of lifestyle disorders, and dietary fibres are being advocated to ameliorate the complications associated with these disorders. In the present study, the effects of two soluble fermentable fibres, viz., gum acacia and inulin on the progression of adiposity, insulin resistance, and the expression of genes related to metabolism were examined in C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat and sucrose diet for 18 weeks. The feeding of either type of fibre resulted in decrease in body weight, epididymal fat mass, adipocyte size, hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia. In the fibre-fed groups, the expressions of adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 in the epididymal fat increased significantly, while the expressions of leptin, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha decreased significantly. Moreover, the expressions of genes related to beta-oxidation, viz., carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1ß, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in the liver tissue of the fibre-fed groups enhanced significantly. Furthermore, due to the feeding of either type of fibre, the expressions of zonula occludens 1 and fasting-induced adipose factor in the distal ileum and proglucagon in the colon increased significantly. From the results of the present study, it can be concluded that the beneficial effects of the fibres are mediated due to enhanced energy expenditure, improved intestinal integrity, and reduced inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: In the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study, metformin plus rosiglitazone (M + R) maintained glycemic control better than metformin alone (M) or metformin plus lifestyle (M + L) in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesized that changes in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) would explain the differential treatment effects on glycemia.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 626 youth ages 11-17 years with T2D duration &lt;2 years, VAT and SAT were estimated by DXA at baseline and at 6 and 24 months. Changes from baseline were analyzed in linear mixed models.CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the existing reports in adults with T2D, in TODAY, M + R resulted in the most VAT accumulation compared with M + L or M. Differential effects on depot-specific indirect measures of adiposity are unrelated to treatment effects in sustaining glycemic control. Additional studies are needed to understand the clinical markers of metabolic risk profile in youth with T2D on rosiglitazone.

OBJECTIVES: Obesity is one of the causes of metabolic disorders. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) confers beneficial effects not only on body weight (BW) but also on metabolic disorders. The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) level in preheparin serum is associated with visceral adipose tissue and reflects insulin resistance. However, the change in serum preheparin LPL levels after LSG remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the effect of LSG on preheparin LPL level in obese patients compared with nonsurgical treatment.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a total of 100 obese patients who were treated for obesity and had preheparin LPL levels measured before and 12 months after LSG or after 12 months of nonsurgical treatment. Fifty-six patients received LSG (LSG group), and 44 patients had no surgical treatment (nonsurgical group). We compared clinical parameters such as body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and preheparin LPL level before and 12 months after treatment.RESULTS: BMI and HbA1c decreased significantly in both groups, but decreases in both parameters were greater in the LSG group than in the nonsurgical group. Estimated glomerular filtration was significantly improved only in the LSG group. Preheparin LPL level increased significantly only in the LSG group (from 45.8 ± 21.6 to 75.0 ± 34.9 ng/mL, p &lt; 0.001). Multiple regression identified LSG and decreased BMI as independent predictors of preheparin LPL level increase.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LSG independently increases pre-heparin LPL level beyond BW reduction in obese patients.

We explored the relationship of obesity and inflammatory arthritis (IA) by selectively expressing diphtheria toxin in adipose tissue yielding &quot;fat-free&quot; (FF) mice completely lacking white and brown fat. FF mice exhibit systemic neutrophilia and elevated serum acute phase proteins suggesting a predisposition to severe IA. Surprisingly, FF mice are resistant to K/BxN serum-induced IA and attendant bone destruction. Despite robust systemic basal neutrophilia, neutrophil infiltration into joints of FF mice does not occur when challenged with K/BxN serum. Absence of adiponectin, leptin, or both has no effect on joint disease, but deletion of the adipokine adipsin (complement factor D) completely prevents serum-induced IA. Confirming that fat-expressed adipsin modulates the disorder, transplantation of wild-type (WT) adipose tissue into FF mice restores susceptibility to IA, whereas recipients of adipsin-deficient fat remain resistant. Thus, adipose tissue regulates development of IA through a pathway in which adipocytes modify neutrophil responses in distant tissues by producing adipsin.

AIM: The study aim was to analyze our own experience in treating patients with complex skull base defects accompanied by pneumocephalus and, based on the findings, to develop an optimal treatment approach for this pathology.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a series of 30 patients with complex skull base defects accompanied by pneumocephalus who underwent inpatient treatment at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in the period from 2001 to 2017. We analyzed demographic characteristics of patients (gender, age), clinical data (etiology, somatic and neuropsychiatric status, radiological data), and treatment aspects (conservative or surgical treatment, used approach, defect characteristics, reconstructive materials). Treatment outcomes were assessed based on analysis of changes in clinical manifestations, postoperative complications, and recurrences. The obtained data were compared to the results of literature review.RESULTS: In the series of 30 patients with complex skull base defects accompanied by pneumocephalus, the mean age was 41 years (range, 17-68 years); there were 17 (59%) males and 13 (41%) females. Etiologically, there were 17 (59%) traumatic cases, 11 (36%) iatrogenic cases, and 2 (5%) spontaneous cases. Clinically, the patients presented with the following manifestations: psycho-neurological symptoms (41%), nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (36%), impaired consciousness (27%), and meningitis (23%). Eight patients with acute injuries underwent complex conservative treatment that included infusion, and anti-edema, vascular, metabolic, anticonvulsant, and antibacterial therapy. In cases of conservative treatment failure or tension pneumocephalus accompanied by abrupt worsening of the patient's condition, surgical treatment was used. A total of 24 interventions (including revision surgery) were performed in 22 patients. All patients underwent endoscopic endonasal reconstruction of complex skull base defects. Tissues used for reconstruction included the fascia lata and adipose tissue (77%), fascia lata and cartilage/bone from the nasal septum (14%), and a pedicled nasoseptal flap (9%). The success rate of reconstructive interventions was 91%. There were 2 (9%) recurrences. Postoperative complications in the form of meningitis occurred in 4 (18%) patients.CONCLUSION: In the case of a nasal cerebrospinal leak history and worsening of the patient's condition accompanied by common cerebral and psychiatric symptoms, the development of pneumocephalus should be considered first, the early diagnosis of which will facilitate choosing the correct treatment approach. In the case of acute injury in patients with the established diagnosis of pneumocephalus caused by gas-forming infection, conservative therapy is indicated in the early period after neurosurgical interventions with opening of the meninges. Tension pneumocephalus together with a skull base bone defect (according to CT) and a nasal CSF leak history is the indication for surgical treatment. In this case, the endoscopic endonasal technique is the method of choice.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis. In this study, we investigated the potential benefits of sinapine, a rapeseed polyphenol known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6 J mice and the underlying mechanisms. Four week-old mice were randomly divided into four groups and fed a low-fat diet (LFD), a HFD, a HFD with common rapeseed oil (HFD + CRO) and a HFD with sinapine in rapeseed oil (HFD + SRO) for 12 weeks. Supplementation with sinapine reduced the body weight of HFD mice by 10.99%, and decreased the levels of TG and LDL-C by 15.67% and 73.62%, respectively. In addition, sinapine also suppressed the intestinal NF-<U+03BA>B and TNF-a expressions and enhanced the adipose tissue IRS-1 expression in the HFD mice (P &lt; 0.05). In terms of effects on the gut microbiota, sinapine induced a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and increased the abundance of probiotics, such as Lactobacillaceae, Akkermansiaceae and Blautia, along with metabolite short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-mediated upregulation of G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) to inhibit expression of inflammatory factors. Our collective results strongly supported the fact that the utility of sinapine as a prebiotic agent could prevent gut dysbiosis and obesity-related chronic diseases, such as insulin resistance (IR) and NAFLD.

There is a steady increase in the number of overweight and obese people worldwide and increasingly, younger people. Excess adipose tissue impairs the action of insulin, leading to insulin resistance (IR). Tissue IR is a major factor in relation to cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Thus, it is important to recognize at the pre-disease stage with the possibility of therapeutic intervention. IR is assessed using indicators of epidemiological significance, most often calculated from fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin values, so-called indirect indicators of insulin resistance. The most commonly used parameter is the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA). Although the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), Matsuda Index and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) are also used, the values of these indices established for IR vary for different age, sex, populations and ethnic groups. Thus, appropriate reference values of indirect indices should be determined for such groups, and when this is precluded, data from published studies carried out on the most ethnically, socio-economically and age-matched populations should be applied.

Obesity induces accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and ATM-driven inflammatory responses that promote the development of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. ClC-3 chloride channel/antiporter, encoded by the Clcn3, is critical for some basic cellular functions. Our previous work has shown significant alleviation of type 2 diabetes in Clcn3 knockout (Clcn3<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. In the present study we investigated the role of Clcn3 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and ATM inflammation. To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3<sup>-/-</sup> mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. The metabolic parameters were assessed and the abdominal total adipose tissue was scanned using computed tomography. Their epididymal fat pad tissue and adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were isolated for analyses. We found that the HFD-fed Clcn3<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed a significant decrease in obesity-induced body weight gain and abdominal visceral fat accumulation as well as an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism as compared with HFD-fed wild-type mice. Furthermore, the Clcn3 deficiency significantly attenuated HFD-induced ATM accumulation, HFD-increased F4/80<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>-</sup> SVF cells as well as HFD-activated TLR-4/NF-<U+03BA>B signaling in epididymal fat tissue. In cultured human THP-1 macrophages, adenovirus-mediated transfer of Clcn3 specific shRNA inhibited, whereas adenovirus-mediated cDNA overexpression of Clcn3 enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-<U+03BA>B and TLR-4. These results demonstrate a novel role for Clcn3 in HFD-induced obesity and ATM inflammation.

Natural and synthetic biomaterials have been designed to aid in the bone regeneration process. Although multiple stem cell-based biomaterials are currently studied by many researchers, no biomaterial has yet been approved as the most appropriate. Here, we aimed to use and compare alternative synthetic biphasic ceramic Ceraform® (CR) coated with the tissue adhesives fibrin glue (FG) and fibronectin (FN) seeded with osteogenically induced cells, which were previously differentiated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal cells. The osteogenic properties were evaluated on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after cell seeding by histological examinations, determining enzyme activities and gene expressions of osteogenic markers, and scanning electron microscope analysis. Non-coated CR and FG-or FN-coated CR groups displayed all osteogenic differentiation markers, such as osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase activity, osteopontin, Runt-related transcription factor-2, collagen type-1, and bone morphogenetic protein-2, but their distribution in terms of duration varied. The detection of non-collagenous proteins and collagen type-1 indicated the role of FG or FN in enhancing bone remodeling and bone structure stabilization. FG exhibited the advantage of encapsulating cells owing to its clot formation property compared to that by FN when considering the enhanced survival of transplanted cells. Moreover, the fibrin glue-coated CR group showed a distinct difference by expressing osteogenic markers even at the end of late incubation period. These properties indicated that using CR-FG in combination with differentiated cells is a promising alternative improved scaffold for bone repair by cell therapy.

Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) is a metabolic response to acute cold exposure that involves the liberation of chemical energy through physiological mechanisms that are separate from muscle shivering. Recent research suggests that the metabolic and endocrine action of brown adipose tissue (BAT) may play an important role in adult human NST. Thus, characterizing variation in BAT across human populations is of central importance to human biologists interested in human energetics and cardio-metabolic health. The gold standard for measuring BAT requires positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT)-a technique that is expensive, exposes the participant to radiation, and is inaccessible to researchers working in many regions. Here, the author outline a noninvasive, portable alternative approach to quantifying BAT that modifies the protocols commonly used in PET/CT studies. The method consists of three components: (a) activating BAT thermogenesis using a mild cooling condition; (b) indirectly quantifying BAT thermogenesis by measuring the change in skin temperature where BAT is commonly stored using infrared thermal imaging; and (c) estimating NST by measuring the change in energy expenditure using open-circuit indirect calorimetry. The development of &quot;field-friendly&quot; methods will allow human biologists to better characterize population variation in BAT as well as its adaptive and health significance.

KEY POINTS: In vivo, uterine perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) potentiates uterine artery blood flow in pregnant rats, although not in non-pregnant rats. In isolated preparations, uterine PVAT has pro-contractile and anti-dilatory effects on uterine arteries. Pregnancy induces changes in uterine arteries that makes them responsive to uterine PVAT signalling.ABSTRACT: An increase in uterine artery blood flow (UtBF) is a common and necessary feature of a healthy pregnancy. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that adipose tissue surrounding uterine arteries (uterine perivascular adipose tissue; PVAT) is a novel local mediator of UtBF and uterine artery tone during pregnancy. In vivo experiments in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats showed that pregnant animals (gestational day 16, term = 22--23 days) had a three-fold higher UtBF compared to non-pregnant animals. Surgical removal of uterine PVAT reduced UtBF only in pregnant rats. In a series of ex vivo bioassays, we demonstrated that uterine PVAT had pro-contractile and anti-dilatory effects on rat uterine arteries. In the presence of PVAT-conditioned media, isolated uterine arteries from both pregnant and non-pregnant rats had reduced vasodilatory responses. In non-pregnant rats, these responses were mediated at the level of uterine vascular smooth muscle, whereas, in pregnant rats, PVAT-media reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Pregnancy increased adipocyte size in ovarian adipose tissue but had no effect on uterine PVAT adipocyte morphology. In addition, pregnancy down-regulated the gene expression of metabolic adipokines in uterine but not in aortic PVAT. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that uterine PVAT plays a regulatory role in UtBF, at least in part, as a result of its actions on uterine artery tone. We propose that the interaction between the uterine vascular wall and its adjacent adipose tissue may provide new insights for interventions in pregnancies with adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal UtBF.

De novo vascularization of implantable tissue and whole organ constructs has been a significant challenge in the field of tissue engineering; the use of endothelial cell populations for this task is constrained by the cell population's limited regeneration capacity and potential for loss of function. Thus, there is a need for a stem-cell population that may be induced into an endothelial cell phenotype reliably. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) are multipotent cells that can be readily isolated from donor fat and may have the potential to be readily induced into endothelial cells. The ability to stimulate endothelial differentiation of these cells has been limited in standard 2D culture. We hypothesized that 3D culture would yield better differentiation. To study the influence of cell density and culture conditions on the potential of ADSCs to differentiate into an endothelial-like state, we seeded these cells types within a 3D cell-adhesive, proteolytically degradable, peptide-modified poly(ethylene-glycol) (PEG) hydrogel. ADSCs were either cultured in basal media or pro-angiogenic media supplemented with 20 ng/mL of VEGF in 2D and then encapsulated at low or high densities within the PEG-based hydrogel. These encapsulated cells were maintained in either basal media or pro-angiogenic media. Cells were then isolated from the hydrogels and cultured in Matrigel to assess the potential for tubule formation. Our work shows that maintenance of ADSCs in a pro-angiogenic medium in 2D monoculture alone does not result in any CD31 expression. Furthermore, the level of CD31 expression was affected by the density of the cells encapsulated within the PEG-based hydrogel. Upon isolation of these cells, we found that these induced ADSCs were able to form tubules within Matrigel, indicative of endothelial function, while ADSCs cultured in basal medium could not. This finding points to the potential for this stem-cell population to serve as a safe and reliable source of endothelial cells for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine purposes.

PURPOSE: Accumulation of visceral, but not subcutaneous, adipose tissue is highly associated with metabolic disease. Inflammation inciting from adipose tissue is commonly associated with metabolic disease risk and comorbidities. However, constituents of the immune system, lymph nodes, embedded within these adipose depots remain under-investigated. We hypothesize that, lymph nodes are inherently distinct and differentially respond to diet-induced obesity much like the adipose depots they reside in.METHODS: Adipose tissue and lymph nodes were collected from the visceral and inguinal depots of male mice fed 13 weeks of standard CHOW or high fat diet (HFD). Immune cells were isolated from tissues, counted and characterized by flow cytometry or plated for proliferative capacity following Concanavalin A stimulation. Lymph node size and fibrosis area were also characterized.RESULTS: In HFD fed mice visceral adipose tissue accumulation was associated with significant enlargement of the lymph node encased within. The subcutaneous lymph node did not change. Compared with mice fed CHOW for 13 weeks, mice fed HFD had a decline in immune cell populations and immune cell proliferative ability, as well as, exacerbated fibrosis accumulation, within the visceral, but not subcutaneous, lymph node.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity-induced chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with impaired immunity and increased susceptibility to disease. Excessive visceral adiposity and associated inflammation driven by diet likely leads to obesity-induced immune suppression by way of lymph node/lymphatic system pathophysiology.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is well-known to exert complications such as retinopathy, cardiomyopathy and neuropathy. However, in recent years, an elevated osteoarthritis (OA) complaints among diabetics have been observed, portending the risk of diabetic OA. Since formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) is believed to be the etiology of various diseases under hyperglycemic conditions, we firstly established that streptozotocin-induced DM could potentiate the development of OA in C57BL/6J mouse model, and further explored the intra-articularly administered adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) therapy focusing on underlying AGE-associated mechanism. Our results demonstrated that hyperglycemic mice exhibited OA-like structural impairments including a proteoglycan loss and articular cartilage fibrillations in knee joint. Highly expressed levels of carboxymethyl lysine (CML), an AGE and their receptors (RAGE), which are hallmarks of hyperglycemic microenvironment were manifested. The elevated oxidative stress in diabetic OA knee-joint was revealed through increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA). Further, oxidative stress-activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B), the marker of proinflammatory signalling pathway was also accrued; and levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and 13 were upregulated. However, ADSC treatment attenuated all OA-like changes by 4 weeks, and dampened levels of CML, RAGE, MDA, NF-<U+03BA>B, MMP-1 and 13. These results suggest that during repair and regeneration, ADSCs inhibited glycation-mediated inflammatory cascade and rejuvenated cartilaginous tissue, thereby promoting knee-joint integrity in diabetic milieu.

BACKGROUND: Transcriptome analysis of abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) has identified important obesity-associated disturbances. However, the relation between sWAT transcriptome and long-term future changes in body weight remains elusive.OBJECTIVE: To investigate sWAT transcriptome signatures before and after long-term weight changes and assess their predictive value for body weight changes.DESIGN: A total of 56 women were followed longitudinally and subdivided into weight-stable (WS, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>25), weight-gaining (WG, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>14) and weight-losing (WL, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>17) groups between baseline and follow-up (13<U+2009>±<U+2009>1 years). The fasting sWAT transcriptome was analyzed by gene microarray at baseline and follow-up. Key genes associated with weight changes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR.RESULTS: In total 285 transcripts exhibited difference (FDR<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>30%) in expression fold change over time between WL and WS women. WL women displayed decreased pro-inflammatory (NLRP3) but increased insulin-response gene (FASN and GLUT4) expression over time. In comparison, 461 transcripts displayed difference in expression fold change over time between WG and WS women (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Genes involved in autophagic processes (CDK5, SQSTM1 and FBXL2) were generally upregulated in WG women. At baseline, 307 and 302 transcripts were differentially expressed (FDR<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>30%) in WL and WG women, respectively, when independently compared against WS women. Baseline expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes (PPARG, IRS2 and HACD2) was lower, while pro-fibrotic (COL6A1) was higher, in WL than WS women; whereas protein processing genes were lower expressed in WG than in WS women.CONCLUSION: In adult women, long-term body weight change associates with altered sWAT transcriptome. Expression of genes associated with inflammation, insulin response, adipogenesis and lipogenesis are linked to weight loss. However, other pathways such as autophagy not only associate but also predict future weight gain suggesting that intrinsic factors in sWAT impact tissue expansion.

OBJECTIVES: Obesity, an emerging global health issue, involves numerous factors; understanding its underlying mechanisms for prevention and therapeutics is urgently needed. Cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (Crabp1) knockout (CKO) mice exhibit an obese phenotype under normal diet (ND) feedings, which prompted us to propose that Crabp1 could play a role in modulating adipose tissue development/homeostasis. Studies were designed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of Crabp1's action in reducing obesity.METHODS: In animal studies, 6 weeks old male wild type and CKO mice were fed with ND or high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. Body weight and food intake were regularly monitored. Glucose tolerance test and biological parameters of plasma (glucose and insulin levels) were measured after 10 weeks of ND vs. HFD feedings. Visceral adipose tissues were collected for histological and molecular analyses to determine affected signaling pathways. In cell culture studies, the 3T3L1 adipocyte differentiation model was used to examine and validate relevant signaling pathways.RESULTS: CKO mice, compared to WT mice, gained more body weight, exhibited more elevated fasting plasma glucose levels, and developed more severe impaired glucose tolerance under both ND and HFD. Histological examination revealed readily increased adipocyte hypertrophy and adipose tissue inflammation under HFD feedings. In 3T3L1 adipocytes, Crabp1 silencing enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation, accompanied by elevated markers and signaling pathways of lipid accumulation and adipocyte hypertrophy.CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies Crabp1's physiological role against the development of obesity. The protective function of CRABP1 is likely attributed to its classically proposed (canonical) activity as a trap for RA, which will reduce RA availability, thereby dampening RA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and adipocyte hypertrophy. The results suggest Crabp1 as a potentially new therapeutic target in managing obesity and metabolic diseases.

Transplantation of primary hepatocytes has been used in treatments for various liver pathologies and end-stage liver disease. However, shortage of donor tissue and the inability of hepatocyte proliferation in vitro have lead to alternative methods such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, and amniotic epithelial cells were isolated from human bone marrow (BM-MSCs), lipoaspirates (ASCs), and amniotic tissue (AECs) respectively. All cells were differentiated into HLCs on plates coated with Type I collagen or Porcine Liver Extracellular Matrix (PLECM-AA) matrix. Flow cytometry of BM-MSCs and ASCs, and AECs showed high expression of MSC-specific and embryonic stem cell markers respectively. All cell types differentiated into osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. All cell type-derived HLCs presented the typical cuboidal primary hepatocyte morphology on PLECM-AA and fewer vacuoles (AECs) compared to HLCs cultured on type I collagen. Gene analysis of all cell type-derived HLCs cultured on PLECM-AA revealed higher upregulation of genes involved in drug transportation and metabolism compared to HLCs cultured on type I collagen. Although, HLCs cultured on PLECM-AA displayed some hepatocyte-related function and bioactivity, overall gene expression was lower compared to that of primary hepatocytes suggesting that caution should be taken when considering using HLCs to replace total hepatocyte functionality.

AIMS: Innate immune toll-like receptors (TLRs) are emerging as nutrient sensors. Oxidative stress in the adipose tissue in obesity acts as a critical early trigger of altered pathophysiology. TLR2/TLR4 adipose upregulation has been associated with insulin resistance in humans; however, it remains unclear whether oxidative stress can modulate expression of TLR2/4 and related immune-metabolic regulators (IRF3/5) in immune cells. We, therefore, assessed their expression along with proinflammatory cytokines in the human PBMC following induction of oxidative stress.CONCLUSION: Taken together, oxidative stress upregulates expression of TLR2/4, IRF3/5 and signature proinflammatory cytokines in PBMC, involving MAPK/NF-<U+03BA>B dependent signaling, all of which may have implications for metabolic inflammation.

OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular (CV) events are highly prevalent in systemic necrotising vasculitides (SNV). Visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) ratio has been shown to be associated with CV events in various diseases. We aimed to assess the relevance of abdominal adipose tissue measurement to predict major CV events (MCVEs) in SNV.METHODS: Patients with SNV were successively included in a longitudinal study assessing MCVEs and other sequelae. Dual x-ray absorptiometry was performed to evaluate abdominal adipose tissue. Patients were prospectively followed for MCVEs, defined as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, arterial revascularisation and/or hospitalisation for or death from CV causes.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty consecutive SNV patients were included and analysed (54 males, mean age 53±18 years). High CV risk was found in 28 (23.3%) patients. In univariate analysis, age, male gender, VDI, VAT/SAT ratio and serum troponin level were significantly associated with high CV risk, whereas age and VAT/SAT ratio remained independently associated with high CV risk. Variables associated with high tertile of VAT/SAT ratio included age and metabolic risk factors. After median follow-up of 42 months, 19 (16%) patients experienced MCVEs. Hazard ratios for incident MCVEs compared with 1st tertile of VAT/SAT ratio were 7.22 (1.02-51.3; p=0.048) and 9.90 (3.15-31.2; p=0.0002) in the 2nd and 3rd tertile, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal visceral adipose tissue is a reliable surrogate marker of CV risk and predicts incident MCVEs in SNV patients. Abdominal adipose tissue should be probably evaluated routinely in these patients to assess CV risk.

PURPOSE: To verify whether the treatment with linagliptin induces the browning of the subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) and thermogenesis in murine diet-induced obesity (DIO) model.METHODS: Forty animals were randomly assigned to receive a control diet (C, 10% lipids as energy) or a high-fat diet (HF, 50% lipids as energy) for 10 weeks. Each group was re-divided to begin the 5-week treatment, totalizing four experimental groups: C, C-L (C plus linagliptin, 30<U+2009>mg/kg body mass; BM), HF, and HF-L (HF plus linagliptin, 30<U+2009>mg/kg BM). The drug was mixed with diet.RESULTS: HF animals showed overweight, glucose intolerance, and a greater cross-sectional area of adipocytes. The treatment with linagliptin was able to normalize the BM, restore the glucose tolerance and the cross-sectional area of adipocytes. These observations comply with the observation of UCP1-positive multilocular adipocytes in the sWAT of treated animals. Both treated groups (C-L and HF-L) showed high expression of thermogenic and type 2 cytokines genes, which agree with the enhanced body temperature and the lower respiratory exchange ratio, implying enhanced thermogenesis with the use of lipids as fuel.CONCLUSIONS: The reduced BM, the enhanced body temperature, and the presence of positive UCP1 beige cells in the sWAT point to the activation of the browning cascade on the sWAT of linagliptin-treated mice, and hence, linagliptin could induce the thermogenic pathway as a pleiotropic effect that can have translational potential.

During the last two decades, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) gained a place of privilege in the field of regenerative medicine. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as major mediators of MSCs immunosuppressive as well as pro-regenerative activities in many disease models, including inflammatory/degenerative conditions as joint diseases and osteoarthritis. In order to shed light on EVs potential, a rigorous profiling of embedded proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (mRNA/miRNA) is mandatory. Nevertheless, reliable strategies to efficiently score miRNA cargo and modulation under diverse experimental conditions or treatments are missing. The aim of this work was to identify reliable reference genes (RGs) to analyze miRNA content in EVs secreted by adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) and verify their consistency under inflammatory conditions that were proposed to enhance ASC-EVs immunomodulatory and regenerative potential. RefFinder algorithm, that integrates the currently available major computational programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct method), allowed to identify miR-22-5p and miR-29a-5p as the most stable RGs. Notably, both miRNAs maintained the highest stability when EVs isolated from IFNg-treated ASCs were included in the analysis. In addition, considerable effects of suboptimal RGs choice on the reliable quantification of miRNAs involved at different levels (tissue homeostasis or macrophage polarization) in the osteoarthritis phenotype, and thus considered as promising therapeutic molecule, have clearly been demonstrated. In conclusion, a proper normalization method is not only needed for research purposes but also mandatory to characterize clinical products and predict their therapeutic potential, especially in the emerging field of MSCs derived-EVs as new tools for regenerative medicine.

The striatal dopamine (DA) deficiency is known as the main cause of the clinical picture of Parkinson's disease (PD). The disease is a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. The treatment of PD is based on compensation for the brain's supply of DA lost by drug therapy, deep brain stimulation, surgery, gene and cell therapies. Clinical studies have focused on the utility of stem cell-based therapies in PD. Embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used. Recently, human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) have been considered as a suitable source of tissue for this purpose. In this project, hADSCs differentiated into dopaminergic neurons and the specificity of the cell preparations was examined. Human adipose tissues were collected from healthy volunteers undergoing liposuction and hADSCs were isolated by collagenase-based enzymatic method. Flow cytometry was performed using the surface cluster of differentiation (CD) markers to confirm the cell typical properties. Then hADSCs were differentiated to dopaminergic neurons in neurobasal medium in the presence of differentiation factors and confirmed by immunocytochemistry via neuronal and dopaminergic markers. The isolated hADSCs were cultured and identified by the expression of MSCs surface markers including CD90, and CD44. These cells did not express hematopoietic surface markers such as CD45 and CD14. Differentiated cells express neuronal marker NeuN and dopaminergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). It is concluded that hADSCs can be easily taken from the patient's own body and differentiated into dopaminergic cells having a lower risk of transplant rejection.

Muscle loss due to fibrotic or adipogenic replacement of myofibers is common in muscle diseases and muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic precursors (FAPs) are implicated in this process. While FAP-mediated muscle fibrosis is widely studied in muscle diseases, the role of FAPs in adipogenic muscle loss is not well understood. Adipogenic muscle loss is a feature of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) - a disease caused by mutations in dysferlin. Here we show that FAPs cause the adipogenic loss of dysferlin deficient muscle. Progressive accumulation of Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in the myofiber matrix causes FAP differentiation into adipocytes. Lack of AnxA2 prevents FAP adipogenesis, protecting against adipogenic loss of dysferlinopathic muscle while exogenous AnxA2 enhances muscle loss. Pharmacological inhibition of FAP adipogenesis arrests adipogenic replacement and degeneration of dysferlin-deficient muscle. These results demonstrate the pathogenic role of FAPs in LGMD2B and establish these cells as therapeutic targets to ameliorate muscle loss in patients.

BACKGROUND: Visceral obesity and related diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Adiponectin is a hormone that is secreted by adipose tissue and may play an important role in obesity-related morbidity. The aim of this study was to investigate total adiponectin levels in overweight and obese UAE subjects visiting health care facilities for weight management.METHODS: All overweight and obese subjects visiting community health centers were invited to take part in the study. Two hundred and six participants received individualized structured dietary education for weight management. Demographic data, anthropometric measurements and fasting venous blood samples were taken for measurements of total adiponectin and markers of inflammation and nutritional status at baseline and follow up. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent effects of prognostic factors on serum adiponectin levels.RESULTS: A total of 193 (93%) females with a mean age (±SD) 36<U+2009>±<U+2009>11<U+2009>years were included in the analysis. During a follow up period of 427<U+2009>±<U+2009>223<U+2009>days, participants received 13<U+2009>±<U+2009>5 structured dietary education sessions. We observed decreased levels of total adiponectin with increasing quartiles of both waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI). Male gender and history of both gestational and type 2 diabetes were associated with significantly lower total adiponectin levels (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). After adjusting for age, gender, BMI and hip circumference, multiple regression analysis revealed a significant and independent association between waist circumference and total adiponectin levels. At follow up visceral fat loss was associated with a significant decrease in inflammatory markers and a non-significant increase in total adiponectin levels.CONCLUSION: Increased visceral fat in overweight and obese subjects is associated with decreased total adiponectin levels. The health benefits of increasing adiponectin levels using different dietary intervention strategies need to be explored in larger studies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01691365 , registered on 11/09/2012.

Despite tremendous research efforts to identify regulatory factors that control energy metabolism, the prevalence of obesity has been continuously rising, with nearly 40% of US adults being obese. Interactions between secretory factors from adipose tissues and the nervous system innervating adipose tissues play key roles in maintaining energy metabolism and promoting survival in response to metabolic challenges. It is currently accepted that there are three types of adipose tissues, white (WAT), brown (BAT), and beige (BeAT), all of which play essential roles in maintaining energy homeostasis. WAT mainly stores energy under positive energy balance, while it releases fuels under negative energy balance. Thermogenic BAT and BeAT dissipate energy as heat under cold exposure to maintain body temperature. Adipose tissues require neural and endocrine communication with the brain. A number of WAT adipokines and BAT batokines interact with the neural circuits extending from the brain to cooperatively regulate whole-body lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. We review neuroanatomical, histological, genetic, and pharmacological studies in neuroendocrine regulation of adipose function, including lipid storage and mobilization of WAT, non-shivering thermogenesis of BAT, and browning of BeAT. Recent whole-tissue imaging and transcriptome analysis of differential gene expression in WAT and BAT yield promising findings to better understand the interaction between secretory factors and neural circuits, which represents a novel opportunity to tackle obesity.

Adipose tissue (AT) deposits, either intramuscular (i.e., marbling) or at the carcass level, are major economic drivers in the beef industry. To identify biomarkers and unravel mechanisms of AT deposition, we combined gel-based and gel-free methods and we mined the differential proteome of the longissimus thoracis from cows differing by two levels of both carcass and muscular adiposities (CMA). We identified 47 proteins with abundances that varied according to CMA. We listed 26 new candidate biomarkers of marbling and confirmed 21 proteins already proposed in the literature. Seven proteins involved in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis were the least abundant, while 14 proteins related to oxidative metabolism, slow-type muscle or retinoic acid metabolism were the most abundant in the high adiposity group. We highlighted eight proteins as differentially abundant and correlated with both CMA, thereby providing the first list of putative biomarkers of carcass adiposity. These proteins would be targeted in future studies aiming to categorize adiposity in cattle.

In the last decades, many studies conducted in vitro, and in vivo, have shown that thyroid autoimmunity and thyroid cancer (TC) (mainly papillary TC) can be concomitant, even if the exact mechanisms at the basis of this association are still not clear. Growing incidence of TC coincides with increased registration of autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITD) suggesting an association between those pathologies. Elevated TSH levels and thyroid autoimmunity were defined as independent risk factors for TC. However a lot of evidence suggests that autoimmunity and inflammation, per se, are risk factors for TC. The link between inflammation and TC involves multiple components of the immune system, extracellular matrix, stroma, and adipose tissue, with pro-tumoral activity of inflammation being opposed to anti-inflammatory effects, favoring protection against cancer progression. Within the tumor microenvironment, inflammatory cells, belonging both to innate (macrophages) and adaptive (lymphocytes) immune responses, are interconnected with fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, and extracellular matrix through cytokines, chemokines and adipocytokines. Under the influence of transcriptional regulators (such as Nuclear Factor-kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinases, or Phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase-B), oncogenes connected to the different subtypes of TC promote their farthermost proliferative effect on the tumor microenvironment. Future studies will be necessary to understand the connections between thyroid autoimmunity and cancer, also in order to design a tailored therapy for TC patients with AITD.

Malfunction of the liver is a central factor in metabolic disease. Glucose production by liver is complex and controlled via indirect mechanisms; insulin regulates adipose tissue lipolysis, and free fatty acids in turn regulate liver glucose output. This latter concept is confirmed by studies in L-Akt-Foxo1 knockout mice. The adipocyte is a likely locus of hepatic insulin resistance. Also, kidneys play a role in regulating glucose production; denervated kidneys abrogate the effect of fat feeding to cause insulin resistance. Glucose itself is an important regulator of liver metabolism (&quot;glucose effectiveness&quot;); after entering liver, glucose is phosphorylated and can be exported as lactate. Using the dynamic glucose/lactate relationship, we have been able to estimate glucose effectiveness in intact animals and human subjects. Families have been identified with a glucokinase regulatory protein defect; modeling demonstrates elevated glucokinase activity. Insulin clearance by liver is highly variable among normal individuals, and is under environmental control: high fat diet reduces clearance by 30%. Liver insulin clearance is significantly lower in African American (AA) adults and children compared to European American participants, accounting for fasting hyperinsulinemia in AA. We hypothesize that reduced hepatic insulin clearance causes peripheral insulin resistance and increased Type 2 diabetes in AA.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal adiposity is a cardiovascular risk factor; it is assumed that the combination of radiofrequency and physical exercise may decrease this excess of adipose tissue.PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of four intervention sessions on abdominal adipose tissue.METHODOLOGY: The study analyzes the effect of four sessions of aerobic exercise combined with radiofrequency. Participants were 28 healthy female volunteers, aged 18-28 years, randomly assigned to an experimental group and a placebo group. They were characterized by a sociodemographic questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Food Frequency Questionnaire. The groups performed four sessions of abdominal radiofrequency followed by moderate aerobic exercise, assessing body mass, body mass index, fat mass, waist circumference, waist/height ratio, subcutaneous adipose thickness, and horizontal abdominal adipose fold at the first and fourth sessions. In the experimental group, a percentage of potency was used that allowed to maintain the temperature between 40°C and 42°C to the epidermis. In the placebo group, the power of the radiofrequency was 0 W. To compare results, Student's t test was used for a significance level of 0.05.RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in waist circumference, abdominal subcutaneous adipose thickness, and horizontal abdominal fold in the experimental group compared to the placebo group (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: Combined exercise intervention with radiofrequency has been shown to be effective in reducing abdominal adiposity.

Clinical trials with autologous adipose-derived stem cell (AdSC) therapy for ischemic heart diseases (IHDs) are ongoing. However, little is known about combinational therapeutic effect of AdSCs and statin poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles on the ischemic myocardium. We have investigated the hypothesis that statins, which have pleiotropic effects, augment the therapeutic potential of AdSCs and that AdSCs also act as drug delivery tools. Simvastatin-conjugated nanoparticles (SimNPs) significantly promoted migration activity without changing proliferation activity and upregulated growth factor gene expression in vitro. A small number of intravenously administered SimNP-loaded AdSCs (10,000<U+2009>cells per mouse) improved cardiac function following myocardial infarction, inducing endogenous cardiac regeneration in the infarcted myocardium. The de novo regenerated myocardium was thought to be derived from epicardial cells, which were positive for Wilms' tumor protein 1 expression. These findings were attributed to the sustained, local simvastatin release from the recruited SimNP-loaded AdSCs in the infarcted myocardium rather than to the direct contribution of recruited AdSCs to tissue regeneration. SimNP-loaded AdSCs may lead to a novel somatic stem cell therapy for IHDs. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2019.

A lipoblastoma is an infrequent benign tumor derived from embryonal adipose tissue. There are few reports on kidney lipoblastomas; there are fewer than three cases, including our case. An 80-year-old female was detected to have a left renal mass during a routine medical examination. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a heterogeneous mass before surgery, and histopathological tests subsequently revealed that the mass was a rare lipoblastoma. We present this case as a reminder to consider lipoblastomas in the differential diagnoses of kidney masses.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and has been recently related to brain health. We aimed to assess the relationships of NAFLD and its severity, using the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), with cognitive performance.METHODS: Framingham study Offspring and 3rd generation participants were included if they attended exams 9 (2002-2008) and 2 (2008-2011), respectively, were free of dementia and stroke, and did not have excessive alcohol intake. Between 2008 and 2011, participants underwent Multi-detector computed tomography scans of the abdomen to determine NAFLD diagnosis and the NFS was used to categorize the severity of fibrosis. Cross-sectional relationships of NAFLD and the NFS with cognitive testing of memory, abstract reasoning, visual perception, attention and executive function were assessed, while adjusting for multiple cardiometabolic variables including visceral adipose tissue, diabetes and insulin resistance.RESULTS: Of the 1287 participants (mean age = 61±12 years, 48% men), 378 (29%) had NAFLD. The presence of NAFLD was not associated with cognitive function. However, among those with NAFLD (mean age = 61±12 years; 58% men), high compared to low risk of advanced fibrosis was associated with poorer performance on similarities (ß = -2.22 ± 0.83; P = 0.009) and trail-making B minus A (ß = -0.11 ± 0.05; P = 0.028), independently of potential confounders.CONCLUSIONS: Participants with high risk of advanced fibrosis may have poorer cognitive function compared to those with low risk, particularly in executive function and abstract reasoning. Future findings are necessary to evaluate the value of the NFS as a biomarker that predicts cognitive impairment and dementia and to explore the role of hepatic fibrosis in brain health.

Increased adiposity has been associated with adipose tissue low-grade inflammation leading to insulin resistance. Adipocyte differentiation inhibitors are expected to be effective in preventing obesity and related diseases. Anthocyanins (ACNs) are associated to enhanced adipocyte function and protection from metabolic stress. Herein, we evaluated the in vitro protective effects of an ACN rich extract against palmitic acid (PA)-induced hypertrophy, inflammation, and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ACN extract pretreatment reduces lipid accumulation and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-<U+03B3> protein levels induced by PA. In addition, PA induces inflammation with activation of NF-<U+03BA>B pathway, whereas ACN extract pretreatment dose-dependently inhibited this pathway. Furthermore, adipocyte dysfunction associated with hypertrophy induces insulin resistance by affecting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt axis, GLUT-1, and adiponectin mRNA levels. ACN extract pretreatment reverts these effects induced by PA and moreover was able to induce insulin pathway with levels higher than insulin control cells, supporting an insulin sensitizer role for ACNs. This study demonstrates a prevention potential of ACNs against obesity comorbidities, due to their protective effects against inflammation/insulin resistance in adipocytes. In addition, these results contribute to the knowledge and strategies on the evaluation of the mechanism of action of ACNs from a food source under basal and insulin resistance conditions related to obesity.

Consuming food at uncommon times during the day might be associated with obesity in experimental animals and humans. We previously reported that mice become obese and their metabolism becomes disrupted when they consume food during the daytime (sleep phase feeding; SPF), but not during the nighttime (active phase feeding; APF). The goal of the present study was to clarify whether the molecular circadian clock is associated with the mechanisms that underly the metabolic disorders in mice brought about by SPF. We compared the effects of dominant negative Clock gene mutation on metabolic disruption and obesity brought about by SPF in mice. The consumption of food during SP increased body weight, adipose tissue mass and lipogenic gene expression in metabolic tissues, as well as hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in wild-type and Clock mutant mice, and there were no significant differences between genotypes except for the body weight increase which was attenuated by the Clock mutation. Temporal expression of Per2 was synchronized to feeding rhythms in the liver of both genotypes, although the expression of Dbp, a representative clock-controlled gene, was significantly damped in peripheral tissues of Clock mutant mice. These findings suggest that the molecular clock is not essentially associated with metabolic disruption caused by SPF. Desynchronized food consumption and central clock-dependent behaviour as well as rhythmic metabolic mechanisms might be associated with the metabolic disruption caused by SPF.

Brown adipose tissue is a critical regulator of metabolic health, and contributes to thermogenesis by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation through the action of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1). Recent studies have shown that cold exposure and the stimulation of ß3-adrenergic receptors induce the development of brown cell-like &quot;beige&quot; adipocytes in white adipose tissue. Brown and/or beige adipocyte-mediated thermogenesis suppresses high-fat diet-associated obesity. Therefore, the development of brown/beige adipocytes may prevent obesity and metabolic diseases. In the present study, we elucidated whether naturally occurring compounds contribute to regulating the cellular differentiation of brown/beige adipocytes. We screened for the up-regulated expression of Ucp1 during beige adipogenesis using extracts of crude herbal drugs frequently used in Kampo prescriptions (therapeutic drugs in Japanese traditional medicine). This screening revealed that the extract prepared from Citri Unshiu Pericarpium [the peel of Citrus unshiu (Swingle) Marcov.] increased the expression of Ucp1 in beige adipocytes. We also focused on the function of clock genes in regulating brown/beige adipogenesis. Therefore, another aim of the present study was to evaluate naturally occurring compounds that regulate brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1) gene expression. In this review, we focus on naturally occurring compounds that affect regulatory processes in brown/beige adipogenesis, and discuss better preventive strategies for the management of obesity and other metabolic disorders.

Archaic admixture is increasingly recognized as an important source of diversity in modern humans, and Neanderthal haplotypes cover 1%-3% of the genome of present-day Eurasians. Recent work has shown that archaic introgression has contributed to human phenotypic diversity, mostly through the regulation of gene expression. Yet the mechanisms through which archaic variants alter gene expression and the forces driving the introgression landscape at regulatory regions remain elusive. Here, we explored the impact of archaic introgression on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We focused on promoters and enhancers across 127 different tissues as well as on microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. Although miRNAs themselves harbor few archaic variants, we found that some of these variants may have a strong impact on miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Enhancers were by far the regulatory elements most affected by archaic introgression: up to one-third of the tissues we tested presented significant enrichments. Specifically, we found strong enrichments of archaic variants in adipose-related tissues and primary T cells, even after accounting for various genomic and evolutionary confounders such as recombination rate and background selection. Interestingly, we identified signatures of adaptive introgression at enhancers of some key regulators of adipogenesis, raising the interesting hypothesis of a possible adaptation of early Eurasians to colder climates. Collectively, this study sheds new light on the mechanisms through which archaic admixture has impacted gene regulation in Eurasians and, more generally, increases our understanding of the contribution of Neanderthals to the regulation of acquired immunity and adipose homeostasis in modern humans.

Metabolic syndrome poses a major threat on human health affecting the quality of life. Adipose tissue is an important organ which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Adipocytokines secreted by the adipose tissue plays a critical role in storage, food intake, energy expenditure, lipid and glucose metabolism. Leptin is primarily involved in regulating food intake, body weight and energy homeostasis through neuroendocrine functions. Contemporary research suggests that leptin also influences insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. High leptin concentrations are directly associated with the obesity subsequent development of metabolic disease sequelae such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Elucidation of the mechanism of action of leptin would help to develop novel therapeutic approaches for there metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes. This review provides an updated 'state-of-the-art' about the leptin and its role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome at the molecular level.

Growth hormone (GH) binds to its receptor (growth hormone receptor [GHR]) to exert its pleiotropic effects on growth and metabolism. Disrupted GH/GHR actions not only fail growth but also are involved in many metabolic disorders, as shown in murine models with global or tissue-specific Ghr deficiency and clinical observations. Here we constructed an adipose-specific Ghr knockout mouse model Ad-GHRKO and studied the metabolic adaptability of the mice when stressed by high-fat diet (HFD) or cold. We found that disruption of adipose Ghr accelerated dietary obesity but protected the liver from ectopic adiposity through free fatty acid trapping. The heat-producing brown adipose tissue burning and white adipose tissue browning induced by cold were slowed in the absence of adipose Ghr but were recovered after prolonged cold acclimation. We conclude that at the expense of excessive subcutaneous fat accumulation and lower emergent cold tolerance, down-tuning adipose GHR signaling emulates a healthy obesity situation which has metabolic advantages against HFD.

BACKGROUND: In brain, CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 1 (CRTC1) is involved in metabolic dysregulation. In humans a SNP in CRTC1 was associated to body fat percentage and two SNPs affected RNA Pol II binding and chromatin structure, implying epigenetic regulation of CRTC1. We sought to understand the relevance of CRTC1 SNPs, DNA methylation and expression in human eating behaviour and its relationship to clinical variables of obesity in blood and adipose tissue.METHODS: 13 CRTC1 SNPs were included to analyze eating behaviour. For rs7256986, follow up association analyses were applied on DNA methylation, CRTC1 expression and clinical parameters. Linear regression was used throughout the study adjusted for age, sex and BMI. Besides data extraction from previous work, rs7256986 was de-novo genotyped and DNA methylation was evaluated by using pyrosequencing.FINDINGS: We found several SNPs in the CRTC1 locus nominally associated with human eating behaviour or 2hr postprandial insulin levels and observed a correlation with alcohol and coffee intake (all P<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). G-allele carriers of rs7256986 showed slightly increased hip circumference. We showed that rs7256986 represents a methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) in whole blood and adipose tissue. The presence of the SNP and/or DNA methylation correlated with CRTC1 gene expression which in turn, related to BMI and fat distribution.INTERPRETATION: Our data support the known role of CRCT1 regulating energy metabolism in brain. Here, we highlight relevance of CRTC1 regulation in blood and adipose tissue.

Obesity-associated insulin resistance is a forerunner of type 2 diabetes. Macrophages reside within adipose tissue (ATMs) have been reported to regulate insulin sensitivity through secreting miRNAs containing exosomes. Here, we show that miR-29a is increased in obese ATMs derived exosomes (ATMs-Exos) and can be transferred into adipocytes, myocytes and hepatocytes causing insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Administration of obese ATMs-Exos impairs insulin sensitivity of lean mice. While knockdown miR-29a level in obese ATM-Exos blunts this effect. PPAR-d is identified to function as downstream target of miR-29a in regulating insulin resistance. PPAR-d agonist GW501516 partially rescued the insulin resistance induced by miR-29a. Taken together, these findings suggest that ATMs derived exosomal miR-29a could regulate obesity-associated insulin resistance, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for obesity-associated type 2 diabetes.

PURPOSE: To assess the association of fatty acid levels in mammary adipose tissue of postmenopausal women with the presence of breast cancer using the Gradient-echo Spectroscopic Imaging (GSI).RESULTS: Postmenopausal women with malignancies had significantly higher SFA (0.336<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.038) in mammary adipose tissue compared to those with benign disease (0.283<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.046, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0008) and to those with a history of breast cancer (0.287<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.050, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0038). Postmenopausal women with malignant lesions had significantly lower MUFA (0.352<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.041) compared to those with benign disease (0.401<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.043, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0032) and with history of breast cancer (0.388<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.055, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0484). The history of cancer group had a significant correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.60, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006) between SFA and BMI, and the cancer group had a significant correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.57, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.010) between PUFA and BMI.CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acid composition of mammary adipose tissue, particularly higher SFA and lower MUFA, may be associated with breast cancer. The GSI method utilizes an automated voxel-based analysis to measure fatty acid composition, and may be used to assess the role of mammary adipose tissue in cancer development and progress.

OBJECTIVE: Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) has recently been introduced as a novel brown adipose tissue (BAT)-secreted adipokine with beneficial metabolic effects in mice. However, regulation of Nrg4 in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been elucidated, so far.METHODS: Serum Nrg4 levels were quantified by ELISA in 60 subjects with ESKD on chronic hemodialysis as compared to 60 subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;50 ml/min/1.73m² in a cross-sectional cohort. Within both groups, about half of the patients had a T2DM. Furthermore, mNrg4 mRNA expression was determined in two mouse models of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) as compared to two different groups of non-diabetic control mice. Moreover, mNrg4 mRNA expression was investigated in murine brown and white adipocytes, as well as hepatocytes, after treatment with the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate.RESULTS: Median serum Nrg4 was significantly lower in patients with ESKD compared to controls and the adipokine was independently associated with a beneficial renal, glucose, and lipid profile. In mice with DKD, mNrg4 mRNA expression was decreased in all adipose tissue depots compared to control mice. The uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate did not significantly alter mNrg4 mRNA expression in adipocytes and hepatocytes, in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: Circulating Nrg4 is independently associated with a preserved renal function and mNrg4 mRNA expression is reduced in adipose tissue depots of mice with DKD. The BAT-secreted adipokine is further associated with a beneficial glucose and lipid profile supporting Nrg4 as potential treatment target in metabolic and renal disease states.

This study aimed to investigate sodium salicylate (SS) treatment effects on the proteome of adipose tissue (AT) in postpartum cows. Twenty Holstein cows were assigned to control (CON, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>10) or SS (n<U+202F>=<U+202F>10) provided via drinking water (2.3<U+202F>g/L) during the first 7<U+202F>d of lactation. Subcutaneous AT was collected on d 7 of treatment and label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics and immunoblotting were analyzed in a subset of 5 AT per group. Eighty out of 1422 proteins (5.6%) were differentially abundant between CON and SS [fold change ±1.5, P<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05]. Top canonical pathways differing between CON and SS (Ingenuity) were complement system, interleukin-10 signaling, and acute phase response signaling. The abundances of complement C1r, C1qC, C1qB and C6 were greater in SS than CON. Regarding IL-10 signaling, the abundances of BLVRB, STAT3, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) were greater in SS AT compared to CON. Immunoblots revealed increased abundance of paraoxanase-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as a tendency for greater abundance of cluster differentiation 172a in SS AT, which may indicate of increased macrophage infiltration. SS treatment postpartum likely promotes inflammatory signaling in AT of dairy cows, perhaps due to immune cell recruitment. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates that treating early lactating cows with sodium salicylate, an anti-inflammatory agent that has been shown to have metabolic effects and increase milk production in dairy cows, affects the proteome of subcutaneous adipose tissue in early lactating dairy cows. Unexpectedly, sodium salicylate treatment enriched inflammatory pathways of the complement system, cytokine signaling, and acute phase response, as revealed by proteomic analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissues from cows at 7<U+202F>d postpartum. These findings imply that SS treatment during the first 7<U+202F>d of lactation likely promotes inflammatory signaling in AT of the dairy cow, perhaps due to immune cell recruitment. Tissue-specific impacts of systemic sodium salicylate requires further scrutiny.

The aim of this work was to determine if the anorexigen nesfatin-1 modulates the expression of genes involved in glucoregulation in rainbow trout. First, the nesfatin-1 sequence from trout was confirmed. Second, the effects of 0.1, 1 and 10<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1 on insulin, glucagon, igf-I, igf-II, glut1, glut2, glut4 and sglt1 expression were tested in cultured liver, gut, muscle and adipose tissue. In liver, the expression of insulin and glucagon isoforms X1 increased after 2<U+202F>h of incubation with 0.1<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1, while insulin and glucagon X2 expression increased after 4<U+202F>h with 1<U+202F>nM treatment. All nesfatin-1 doses tested decreased glut2 expression after 4<U+202F>h. In adipose tissue, all nesfatin-1 concentrations reduced insulin X1 expression at 30<U+202F>min, and 1<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1 increased insulin X2 expression at 4<U+202F>h. In gut, 0.1, 1 and 10<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1 decreased glut2 and sglt1 mRNA levels after 240<U+202F>min of incubation. In muscle, 0.1<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1 increased the expression of igf-I after 240<U+202F>min. The expression of igf-II in muscle increased after 30<U+202F>min of incubation with 1 and 10<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1 and after 120<U+202F>min of incubation with 0.1 and 1<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1. Expression of glut1 and sglt1 in muscle increased after 240<U+202F>min of incubation with 0.1<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1 and after 120<U+202F>min with 0.1 and 10<U+202F>nM nesfatin-1, respectively. These results suggest that nesfatin-1 could decrease the gut intake of dietary glucose, and increase its uptake in glucoregulatory tissues such as liver and muscle of rainbow trout.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important modulators of thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT). They have been involved in its differentiation and hence its functioning. While different regulators of the miRNA machinery have been shown to be essential for BAT differentiation, little is known about their implication in BAT activation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of AGO2, the chief miRNA mediator, in BAT activation. We took advantage of two non-genetic models of BAT activation to analyze the miRNA machinery and miRNA expression in BAT. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain an overview of miRNA expression according to the BAT activation state. In vitro, we examined AGO2 expression during brown adipocyte differentiation and activation. Finally, we downregulated AGO2 to reveal its potential role in the thermogenic function of brown adipocytes. PCA analysis allowed to cluster animals on their miRNA signature in active BAT. Moreover, hierarchical clustering showed a positive correlation between global upregulation of miRNA expression and active BAT. Consistently, the miRNA machinery, particularly AGO2, was upregulated in vivo in active BAT and in vitro in mature brown adipocytes. Finally, the partial loss-of-function of AGO2 in mature brown adipocytes is sufficient to lead to a diminished expression of UCP1 associated to a decreased uncoupled respiration. Therefore, our study shows the potential contribution of AGO2 in BAT activation. Since BAT is a calorie-burning tissue these data have a translational potential in terms of therapeutic target in the field of altered fuel homeostasis associated to obesity and diabetes.
