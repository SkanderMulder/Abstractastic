<p>Accurate prediction of the impact of genomic variation on phenotype is a major goal of computational biology and an important contributor to personalized medicine. Computational predictions can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying genetic diseases, including cancer, but their adoption requires thorough and unbiased assessment. Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, from homocysteine to cystathionine, and in which variations are associated with human hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. We have created a computational challenge under the CAGI framework to evaluate how well different methods can predict the phenotypic effect(s) of CBS single amino acid substitutions using a blinded experimental data set. CAGI participants were asked to predict yeast growth based on the identity of the mutations. The performance of the methods was evaluated using several metrics. The CBS challenge highlighted the difficulty of predicting the phenotype of an ex vivo system in a model organism when classification models were trained on human disease data. We also discuss the variations in difficulty of prediction for known benign and deleterious variants, as well as identify methodological and experimental constraints with lessons to be learned for future challenges.

<p>Dietary sulfur amino acid restriction, also referred to as methionine restriction, increases food intake and energy expenditure and alters body composition in rodents, resulting in improved metabolic health and a longer lifespan. Among the known nutrient-responsive signaling pathways, the evolutionary conserved integrated stress response (ISR) is a lesser-understood candidate in mediating the hormetic effects of dietary sulfur amino acid restriction (SAAR). A key feature of the ISR is the concept that a family of protein kinases phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), dampening general protein synthesis to conserve cellular resources. This slowed translation simultaneously allows for preferential translation of genes with special sequence features in the 5’ leader. Among this class of mRNAs is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), an orchestrator of transcriptional control during nutrient stress. Several ATF4 gene targets help execute key processes affected by SAAR such as lipid metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway, and antioxidant defenses. Exploration of the canonical ISR demonstrates that eIF2 phosphorylation is not necessary for ATF4-driven changes in the transcriptome during SAAR. Additional research is needed to clarify the regulation of ATF4 and its gene targets during SAAR.</p>

<p>Mental retardation is the most common feature among inborn errors of amino acid metabolism. Patients with homocystinuria/homocysteinemia caused by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency suffer from thromboembolism and mental retardation from early ages; therefore, detection by newborn screening is performed. Furthermore, elevated levels of serum homocysteine during pregnancy are associated with the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in newborns. However, the causes of such central nervous system (CNS) defects are unknown. We found previously impaired learning abilities in Cbs-deficient (Cbs<sup>-/-</sup>) mice (but not NTD births). Here, we investigated the amino acid profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Mice deficient in cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (Cth), a downstream enzyme of CBS in transsulfuration, as well as wild-type mice, were analyzed as controls. Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> and Cth<sup>-/-</sup> mice were smaller than wild-type mice, and CSF yields in Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mice were lower than the others. CSF amino acid levels were generally lower than those in serum, and compared with the dramatic amino acid level alterations in Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mouse serum, alterations in CSF were less apparent. However, marked upregulation (versus wild-type) of aspartic acid/asparagine (Asp/Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), total homocysteine, and citrulline, and downregulation of lysine (Lys) were found in Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mouse CSF. Because similar regulation of total homocysteine/citrulline/Lys was observed in the CSF of Cth<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which are free of CNS dysfunction, the reduced CSF volumes and the level changes of other amino acids could be relevant to Cbs<sup>-/-</sup>-specific CNS defects.</p>

<p>Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway where cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a rate-limiting enzyme. Homocysteine is thought to play a role in bone remodelling and strength. Previous results indicated that some of the difference in bone strength of end-of-lay hens may be associated with CBS expression level. To investigate if differences in the promoter region of the CBS gene might be responsible for observed differences in gene expression between CBS alleles post mortem- and in-vitro expression studies have been undertaken. Transfection of the DF-1 avian cell line with a series of deletion fragments of the 5’ promoter, or constructs containing three CBS allele sequences, with a luciferase reporter revealed that a core region of -155 to +131<U+202F>bp in the CBS promoter was essential for mRNA expression. We found that a variable number of short tandem repeats (7 nucleotide motif and 6 nucleotide repeats) in the core region of the promoter affecting the transcriptional activity and a strong effect for gene expression. However, methylation of the 6 nucleotide repeats varied between allelic variants and these maybe responsible for differences in promoter activity. Our findings indicated variable short tandem repeats and the differentially methylated sites in the promoter region may be responsible for CBS expression differences in the bone of laying hens.</p>

<p>O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) are members of the PLP-II family, and involved in L-cysteine production. OASS produces L-cysteine via a de novo pathway while CBS participates in the reverse transsulfuration pathway. O-acetylserine-dependent CBS (OCBS) was previously identified as a new member of the PLP-II family, which are predominantly seen in bacteria. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori possess only one OASS (hp0107) gene and we showed that the protein coded by this gene actually functions as an OCBS and utilizes L-homocysteine and O-acetylserine (OAS) to produce cystathionine. HpOCBS did not show CBS activity with the substrate L-serine and required OAS exclusively. The HpOCBS structure in complex with methionine showed a closed cleft state, explaining the initial mode of substrate binding. Sequence and structural analyses showed differences between the active sites of OCBS and CBS, and explain their different substrate preferences. We identified three hydrophobic residues near the active site of OCBS, corresponding to one serine and two tyrosine residues in CBSs. Mutational studies were performed on HpOCBS and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS. A ScCBS double mutant (Y158F/Y226V) did not display activity with L-serine, indicating indispensability of these polar residues for selecting substrate L-serine, however, did show activity with OAS.</p>

<p>The non-essential amino acid cysteine is used within cells for multiple processes that rely on the chemistry of its thiol group. Under physiological conditions, many non-transformed tissues rely on glutathione, circulating cysteine, and the de novo cysteine synthesis (transsulfuration) pathway as sources of intracellular cysteine to support cellular processes. In contrast, many cancers require exogeneous cystine for proliferation and viability. Herein, we review how the cystine transporter, xCT, and exogenous cystine fuel cancer cell proliferation and the mechanisms that regulate xCT expression and activity. Further, we discuss the potential contribution of additional sources of cysteine to the cysteine pool and what is known about the essentiality of these processes in cancer cells. Finally, we discuss whether cyst(e)ine dependency and associated metabolic alterations represent therapeutically targetable metabolic vulnerabilities.</p>

Recent estimates indicate that if a mother has previously had a child with ASD, the risk of having a second child with ASD is ~18.7% (High Risk) whereas the risk of ASD in the general population is ~1.7% (Low Risk).</AbstractText>: Currently there is no test for pregnant mothers that can predict the probability of having a child that will be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Pregnant mothers who have had a child with autism before were separated into two groups based on the diagnosis of their child whether the child had autism (ASD) or not (TD). Then these mothers were compared to a group of control mothers who have not had a child with autism before. A total of 107 mothers were in the High Risk category and 25 mothers in the Low Risk category. The High Risk category was further separated into 29 mothers in the ASD group and 78 mothers in the TD group.</AbstractText>: In this study, metabolites of the folate-dependent transmethylation and transsulfuration biochemical pathways of pregnant mothers were measured to determine whether or not the risk of having a child with autism could be predicted by her metabolic profile.

<p>Although choline requirements for cows are unknown, enhanced postruminal supply may decrease liver triacylglycerol and increase flux through the Met cycle to improve immunometabolic status during a negative nutrient balance (NNB). Our objectives were to investigate the effects of postruminal choline supply during a feed restriction-induced NNB on (1) hepatic activity cystathionine ß-synthase and transcription of enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway and Met cycle; (2) hepatic metabolites in the Met cycle and the transsulfuration pathway, bile acids, and energy metabolism; and 3) plasma biomarkers of liver function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Ten primiparous rumen-cannulated Holstein cows (158 ± 24 d postpartum) were used in a replicated 5 × 5 Latin square design with 4-d treatment periods and 10 d of recovery (14 d/period). Treatments were unrestricted intake with abomasal infusion of water, restricted intake (R; 60% of net energy for lactation requirements) with abomasal infusion of water, or R plus abomasal infusion of 6.25, 12.5, or 25 g/d choline ion. Liver tissue was collected on d 5 after infusions ended, and blood was collected on d 1, 3, and 5. Statistical contrasts were A0 versus R0 (CONT1), R versus the average of choline doses (CONT2), and tests of linear and quadratic effects of choline dose. Activity of cystathionine ß-synthase was lower with R (CONT1) and decreased linearly with choline. Hepatic glutathione was not different with R or choline, but taurine tended to be greater with choline (CONT2). Betaine and carnitine were greater with R (CONT1) and further increased with choline (CONT2). Concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> were greater with choline (CONT2). Cholic and glycol-chenodeoxycholic acids were decreased by R and choline, while taurocholic and tauro-chenodeoxycholic acids were not altered. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin were greater with R (CONT1) but decreased with choline (CONT2). Paraoxonase was lower with R and increased with choline (CONT2). Data suggest that enhanced supply of choline during NNB decreases entry of homocysteine to the transsulfuration pathway, potentially favoring remethylation to Met by acquiring a methyl group from betaine. As such, Met may provide methyl groups for synthesis of carnitine.

<p>The dietary requirement for cysteine is not determined in poultry since it is not an essential amino acid. The cysteine need is expected to be met through the transsulfuration pathway where homocysteine, a precursor of methionine, is converted to cysteine. Cysteine is a major component of plumage, and the degree to which cysteine is involved in plumage and other keratized proteins are unknown. We randomly assigned chicks to control and treatment (deficient in cysteine) diets for 49<U+2009>d. The thickness of the skin layers, feather follicle length, and thickness were measured at days 10, 24, 34, and 49. We also measured the hepatic mRNA expressions of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTL), cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), and glutathione synthetase (GSS). Chickens fed the treatment diet had reduced epidermis thickness and shorter feather follicles compared with the controls. The chicken fed the treatment diet also had increased mRNA expression of CBS and CTL indicating a disruption of the transsulfuration pathway. The treatment chickens also had a decreased hepatic CDO and increased GSS mRNA expressions which are in concordance with the homeostatic regulation of cysteine. Compromised cysteine metabolism could affect thermoregulation and subsequently affect feed efficiency and welfare of the birds.</p>

<p>The gut microbiota is extremely important for the health of the host across its lifespan.Recent studies have elucidated connections between the gut microbiota and neurological diseaseand disorders such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), autism, and a host of otherbrain illnesses. Dysbiosis of the normal gut flora can have negative consequences for humans,especially throughout key periods during our lifespan as the gut microbes change with age in bothphenotype and number of bacterial species. Neurologic diseases, mental disorders, and euthymicstates are influenced by alterations in the metabolites produced by gut microbial milieu. Weintroduce a new concept, namely, the mycobiota and microbiota-gut-brain neuroendocrine axis anddiscuss co-metabolism with emphasis on means to influence or correct disruptions to normal gutflora throughout the lifespan from early development to old age. These changes involveinflammation and involve the permeability of barriers, such as the intestine blood barrier, the blood<U+207B>brain barrier, and others. The mycobiota and microbiota<U+207B>gut<U+207B>brain axis offer new research horizonsand represents a great potential target for new therapeutics, including approaches based aroundinflammatory disruptive process, genetically engineered drug delivery systems, diseased cellculling “kill switches”, phage-like therapies, medicinal chemistry, or microbial parabiosis to namea few.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: Homocysteine (Hcy) in humans represents a blood-borne biomarker which predicts the risk of age-related diseases and mortality. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we tested whether feeding betaine-rich sugar beet molasses affects the survival under heat stress in the presence of Hcy, in spite of a gene loss in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase.METHODS: Knockdown of the genes relevant for remethylation or transsulfuration of Hcy was achieved by RNA interference (RNAi). Survival assay was conducted under heat stress at 37 °C and Hcy levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Addition of 500 mg/l betaine-rich sugar beet molasses (SBM) prevented the survival reduction that was caused by exposure to Hcy at 37 °C. Although SBM was no longer capable of reducing Hcy levels under RNAi versus homologues for 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or cystathionine-ß-synthase, it still enabled the survival extension by SBM under exposure to Hcy. In contrast, RNAi for the small heat shock protein hsp-16.2 or the foxo transcription factor daf-16 both prevented the extension of survival by betaine-rich molasses in the presence of Hcy.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that betaine-rich SBM is able to prevent survival reduction caused by Hcy in C. elegans in dependence on hsp-16.2 and daf-16 but independent of the remethylation pathway.</p>

<p>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The presence of CBS in mouse vascular endothelium was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The relaxant activity of L-serine (0.1-300 µM) and L-cysteine (0.1-300 µM) was estimated on mouse aorta rings, with or without endothelium. A pharmacological modulation study evaluated NO and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) involvement. Levels of NO and S1P were also measured following incubation of aorta tissue with either L-serine (1, 10, and 100 µM) or L-cysteine (10, 100 µM, and 1 mM).KEY RESULTS: L-serine relaxed aorta rings in an endothelium-dependent manner. The vascular effect was reduced by L-NG-nitro-arginine methyl ester and wortmaninn. A similar pattern was obtained with L-cysteine. The S1P1 receptor antagonist (W146) or the SPT inhibitor (myriocin) reduced either L-serine or L-cysteine relaxant effect. L-serine or L-cysteine incubation increased NO and S1P levels in mouse aorta.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: L-serine, a by-product formed within the transsulfuration pathway starting from L-cysteine via CBS, contributes to the vasodilator action of L-cysteine. The L-serine effect involves both NO and S1P. This mechanism could be involved in the marked dysregulation of vascular tone in hyperhomocysteinemic patients (CBS deficiency) and may represent a feasible therapeutic target.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: DL-2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutyric acid (DL-HMTBA), an L-methionine (L-Met) hydroxyl analogue, has been suggested to be a dietary L-Met source. How dietary DL-HMTBA compared with L-Met affects whole-body L-Met kinetics in growing individuals is unknown.OBJECTIVES: We determined to what extent DL-HMTBA supplementation of an L-Met-deficient diet affects whole-body L-Met and L-cysteine (L-Cys) kinetics, protein synthesis (PS), and the L-Met incorporation rate in liver protein (L-MetInc) compared with L-Met and DL-Met supplementation in a piglet model.METHODS: Forty-five, 28-d-old weaned piglets (male, German Landrace) were allocated to 4 dietary groups: L-Met-deficient diet [Control: 69% of recommended L-Met plus L-Cys supply; 0.22% standardized ileal digestible (SID) L-Met; 0.27% SID L-Cys; n = 12] and Control diet supplemented equimolarly to 100% of recommended intake with either L-Met (n = 12; LMET), DL-Met (n = 11; DLMET), or DL-HMTBA (n = 10; DLHMTBA). At 47 d of age, the piglets were infused with L-[1-13C; methyl-2H3]-Met and [3,3-2H2]-Cys to determine the kinetics and PS rates. Plasma amino acid (AA) concentrations, hepatic mRNA abundances of L-Met cycle and transsulfuration (TS) enzymes, and L-MetInc were measured.RESULTS: During feed deprivation, L-Met kinetics did not differ between groups, and were =3 times higher in the fed state (P &lt; 0.01). Remethylation (RM) was 31% and 45% higher in DLHMTBA than in DLMET and Control pigs, respectively, and the RM:transmethylation (TM) ratio was 50% higher in DLHMTBA than in LMET (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, TS and the TS:TM ratio were 32% lower in DLHMTBA than in LMET (P &lt; 0.05). L-MetInc was 42% lower in DLMET and DLHMTBA than in L-Met-deficient Control pigs, whereas plasma AA and hepatic mRNA abundances were similar among DL-HMTBA-, L-Met-, and DL-Met-supplemented pigs.CONCLUSIONS: In piglets, DL-HMTBA compared with L-Met and DL-Met supplementation increases RM and reduces the TS rate to conserve L-Met, but all 3 Met isomers support growth at a comparable rate.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Vitiligo is a multifactorial polygenic disorder with a complex pathogenesis. It is related to both genetic and no genetic factors. The role of genetics is currently studied with several analytical approaches, such as genetic linkage, candidate gene association studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), deep DNA re-sequencing and gene expression studies. To date, there are no genetic traits directly related to vitiligo pathogenesis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 43 cases of vitiligo patients and 30 healthy donors recruited as control, were screened by assaying the biochemical molecules involved in the self-cells cytotoxicity (haptoglobin and homocysteine) and candidate genes involved in the regulatory process of the re-methylation cycles and transsulfuration. Candidate genes and their polymorphisms screened are methylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C; cystathionine-beta-synthase enzyme (CBS) I278T and Ins68bp; and methionine-synthase-reductase (MTRR) A66G.RESULTS: A peculiar genetic profile in vitiligo patients are defined: 11.6% of vitiligo patients shown polymorphic variant MTHFR 677TT vs. 3.3% of healthy donor MTHFR 677CC profile (p=0.0017); 14.0% of vitiligo patients shown CBS polymorphic variant 278TT vs. 3.3% of healthy donor 278II profile (p=0.0012); and 11.6% of vitiligo patients shown MTRR 66GG vs. 3.3% of healthy donor MTRR 677AA profile (p&gt;0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the correlation between the polymorphic status of MTHFR C677T, CBS I278T, and MTRR A66G and vitiligo. The genetic screening of these polymorphisms could be useful for early detection of the inheritance risk factor in a subject carrying relatives with vitiligo. Although these data could suggest a kind of dysregulation, genetically based, of thiols production mechanisms. Based on these results, we have not been able to get hypothesis about the putative pathogenesis of vitiligo, and the precise cause remains unclear.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Detrimental exposures during pregnancy have been implicated in programming offspring to develop permanent changes in physiology and metabolism, increasing the risk for developing diseases in adulthood such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. This study investigated the effects of protein restriction on the metabolism of amino acids within the oocyte, liver, and whole organism in a rat model as well as effects on mitochondrial ultrastructure and function in the cumulus oocyte complex.RESULTS: Oocytes demonstrated reduced serine flux in LP vs. LPF (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), reduced cysteine flux in LP and LPF vs. C (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), and a trend toward reduced transsulfuration in LP vs. C and LPF. Folic acid supplementation reversed observed effects on serine flux and transsulfuration. Preovulatory protein restriction increased whole-body methionine transmethylation, methionine transsulfuration and the flux of serine in LP and LPF vs. C (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005). The concentration of glutathione was increased in erythrocytes and liver in LP and LPF vs. C (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0003). Oocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure in LP and LPF had increased proportions of abnormal mitochondria vs. C (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01 and p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Cumulus cell mitochondrial ultrastructure in LP and LPF groups had increased proportions of abnormal mitochondria vs. C (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001 and p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Preovulatory protein restriction altered oocyte expression of Drp1, Opa-1, Mfn1/2, Parl and Ndufb6 (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) and Hk2 (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), which are genes involved in mitochondrial fission (division) and fusion, mitochondrial apoptotic mechanisms, respiratory electron transport and glucose metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: Preovulatory protein restriction resulted in altered amino acid metabolism, abnormal cumulus oocyte complex mitochondrial ultrastructure and differential oocyte expression of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>

<p>Metabolism directs the severe acute inflammatory reaction of monocytes to guard homeostasis. This occurs by sequentially activating anabolic immune effector mechanisms, switching to immune deactivation mechanisms and then restoring immunometabolic homeostasis. Nuclear sirtuin 1 and mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase metabolically drive this dynamic and are druggable targets that promote immunometabolic resolution in septic mice and increase survival. We used unbiased metabolomics and a validated monocyte culture model of activation, deactivation, and partial resolution of acute inflammation to sequentially track metabolic rewiring. Increases in glycogenolysis, hexosamine, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathways were aligned with anabolic activation. Activation transitioned to combined lipid, protein, amino acid, and nucleotide catabolism during deactivation, and partially subsided during early resolution. Lipid metabolic rewiring signatures aligned with deactivation included elevated n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased levels of fatty acid acylcarnitines. Increased methionine to homocysteine cycling increased levels of s-adenosylmethionine rate-limiting transmethylation mediator, and homocysteine and cysteine transsulfuration preceded increases in glutathione. Increased tryptophan catabolism led to elevated kynurenine and de novo biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide from quinolinic acid. Increased branched-chain amino acid catabolism paralleled increases in succinyl-CoA. A rise in the Krebs cycle cis-aconitate-derived itaconate and succinate with decreased fumarate and acetyl-CoA levels occurred concomitant with deactivation and subsided during early resolution. The data suggest that rewiring of metabolic and mitochondrial bioenergetics by monocytes sequentially activates, deactivates, and resolves acute inflammation.</p>

<p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a lethal disease that is characterized by auto-immunity, vascular injury, and progressive fibrosis of multiple organ systems. Despite the fact that the exact etiology of SSc remains unknown, oxidative stress has been associated with a large range of SSc-related complications. In addition to the well-known detrimental properties of reactive oxygen species (ROS), gasotransmitters (e.g., nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)) are also thought to play an important role in SSc. Accordingly, the diverse physiologic actions of NO and CO and their role in SSc have been previously studied. Recently, multiple studies have also shown the importance of the third gasotransmitter H2S in both vascular physiology and pathophysiology. Interestingly, homocysteine (which is converted into H2S through the transsulfuration pathway) is often found to be elevated in SSc patients; suggesting defects in the transsulfuration pathway. Hydrogen sulfide, which is known to have several effects, including a strong antioxidant and vasodilator effect, could potentially play a prominent role in the initiation and progression of vasculopathy. A better understanding of the actions of gasotransmitters, like H2S, in the development of SSc-related vasculopathy, could help to create early interventions to attenuate the disease course. This paper will review the role of H2S in vascular (patho-)physiology and potential disturbances in SSc. Moreover, current data from experimental animal studies will be reviewed. Lastly, we will evaluate potential interventional strategies.</p>

<p>There are numerous theories of aging, a process which still seems inevitable. Aging leads to cancer and multi-systemic disorders as well as chronic diseases. Decline in age- associated cellular functions leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline that affect the quality of life. Accumulation of damage, mutations, metabolic changes, failure in cellular energy production and clearance of altered proteins over the lifetime, and hyperhomocysteinemia, ultimately result in tissue degeneration. The decline in renal functions, nutritional deficiencies, deregulation of methionine cycle and deficiencies of homocysteine remethylation and transsulfuration cofactors cause elevation of homocysteine with advancing age. Abnormal accumulation of homocysteine is a risk factor of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, approximately 50% of people, aged 65 years and older develop hypertension and are at a high risk of developing cardiovascular insufficiency and incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Increasing evidence suggests inverse relation between cognitive impairment, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and renal function. Oxidative stress, inactivation of nitric oxide synthase pathway and mitochondria dysfunction associated with impaired homocysteine metabolism lead to aging tissue degeneration. In this review, we examine impact of high homocysteine levels on changes observed with aging that contribute to development and progression of age associated diseases.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial disorders (MDs) are inherited multi-organ diseases with variable phenotypes. Inclusion body myositis (IBM), a sporadic inflammatory muscle disease, also shows mitochondrial dysfunction. We investigated whether primary and secondary MDs modify metabolism to reveal pathogenic pathways and biomarkers. We investigated metabolomes of 25 mitochondrial myopathy or ataxias patients, 16 unaffected carriers, six IBM and 15 non-mitochondrial neuromuscular disease (NMD) patients and 30 matched controls. MD and IBM metabolomes clustered separately from controls and NMDs. MDs and IBM showed transsulfuration pathway changes; creatine and niacinamide depletion marked NMDs, IBM and infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA). Low blood and muscle arginine was specific for patients with m.3243A&gt;G mutation. A four-metabolite blood multi-biomarker (sorbitol, alanine, myoinositol, cystathionine) distinguished primary MDs from others (76% sensitivity, 95% specificity). Our omics approach identified pathways currently used to treat NMDs and mitochondrial stroke-like episodes and proposes nicotinamide riboside in MDs and IBM, and creatine in IOSCA and IBM as novel treatment targets. The disease-specific metabolic fingerprints are valuable “multi-biomarkers” for diagnosis and promising tools for follow-up of disease progression and treatment effect.</p>

<p>Background Cystathionine is an intermediate product in the transsulfuration pathway and formed during the B6-dependent conversion of methionine to cysteine. Elevated plasma cystathionine has been related to atherosclerosis, which is a major etiological factor for ischemic stroke. However, the role of cystathionine in stroke development is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively assessed the association of circulating levels of cystathionine with risk of total and ischemic stroke. Methods and Results Two-thousand thirty-six patients (64% men; median age, 62 years) undergoing coronary angiography for suspected stable angina pectoris were included. Stroke cases were identified by linkage to the CVDNOR (Cardiovascular Disease in Norway) project. Hazard ratios with confidence intervals (95% confidence interval) were estimated by using Cox-regression analyses. During 7.3 years of median follow-up, 124 (6.1%) incident strokes were ascertained, which comprised 100 cases of ischemic stroke. There was a positive association of plasma cystathionine with risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke. Comparing the fourth versus the first cystathionine quartiles, age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 2.11 (1.19-3.75) and 2.56 (1.31-4.99) for total and ischemic stroke, respectively. Additional adjustment for major stroke risk factors only slightly attenuated the associations, which tended to be stronger in patients without previous or existing atrial fibrillation at baseline (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.43 [1.27-4.65] and 2.88 [1.39-5.98] for total and ischemic stroke, respectively). Conclusions In patients with suspected stable angina pectoris, plasma cystathionine was independently related to increased risk of total stroke and, in particular, ischemic stroke.

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Homocystinurias are rare genetic defects characterized by altered fluxes of sulfur compounds including homocysteine and cysteine. We explored whether the severely perturbed sulfur amino acid metabolism in patients with homocystinurias affects the metabolism of hydrogen sulfide.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We studied 10 treated patients with a block in the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine due to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency (CBSD) and six treated patients with remethylation defects (RMD) and an enhanced flux of sulfur metabolites via transsulfuration. Control groups for CBSD and RMD patients consisted of 22 patients with phenylketonuria on a low-protein diet and of 12 healthy controls respectively. Plasma and urine concentrations of selected sulfur compounds were analysed by HPLC and LC-MS/MS.KEY RESULTS: Patients with CBSD exhibited plasma concentrations of monobromobimane-detected sulfide similar to appropriate controls. Urinary homolanthionine and thiosulfate in CBSD were increased significantly 1.9 and 3 times suggesting higher hydrogen sulfide synthesis by <U+03B3>-cystathionase and detoxification respectively. Surprisingly, patients with RMD had significantly lower plasma sulfide levels (53 and 64% of controls) with lower sulfite concentrations, and higher taurine and thiosulfate levels suggesting enhanced cysteine oxidation and hydrogen sulfide catabolism respectively.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The results from this study suggest that severe inherited defects in sulfur amino acid metabolism may be accompanied by only moderately perturbed hydrogen sulfide metabolism and lends support to the hypothesis that enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway may not be the major contributors to the endogenous hydrogen sulfide pool.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Chemical Biology of Reactive Sulfur Species.

<p>Insufficient supply of Met and choline (Chol) around parturition could compromise hepatic metabolism and milk protein synthesis in dairy cows. Mechanistic responses associated with supply of Met or Chol in primary liver cells enriched with hepatocytes (PHEP) from cows have not been thoroughly ascertained. Objectives were to isolate and culture PHEP to examine abundance of genes and proteins related to transmethylation, transsulfuration, and cytidine 5’-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) pathways in response to Met or Chol. The PHEP were isolated from liver biopsies of Holstein cows (160 d in lactation). More than 90% of isolated cells stained positively for the hepatocyte marker cytokeratin 18. Cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) mRNA abundance was only detectable in the PHEP and liver tissue compared with mammary tissue. Furthermore, in response to exogenous Met (80 µM vs. control) PHEP secreted greater amounts of albumin and urea. Subsequently, PHEP were cultured with Met (40 µM) or Chol (80 mg/dL) for 24 h. Compared with control or Chol, mRNA and protein abundance of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) were greater in PHEP treated with Met. The mRNA abundance of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), and sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) was greater in Met-treated PHEP compared with control or Chol. Compared with control, greater expression of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), and choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) was observed in cells supplemented with Met and Chol. However, Chol led to the greatest mRNA abundance of CHDH. Abundance of choline kinase a (CHKA), choline kinase ß (CHKB), phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1 a (PCYT1A), and choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1) in the CDP-choline pathway was greater in PHEP treated with Chol compared with control or Met. In the transsulfuration pathway, mRNA and protein abundance of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) was greater in PHEP treated with Met compared with control or Chol. Similarly, abundance of cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC), and glutathione reductase (GSR) was greater in response to Met compared with control or Chol. Overall, these findings suggest that transmethylation and transsulfuration in dairy cow primary liver cells are more responsive to Met supply, whereas the CDP-choline pathway is more responsive to Chol supply. The relevance of these data in vivo merit further study.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is responsible for the first enzymatic reaction in the transsulfuration pathway of sulfur amino acids. The molecular function and mechanism of CBS as well as that of transsulfuration pathway remain ill-defined in cell proliferation and death. In the present study, we designed, synthesized and obtained a bioactive inhibitor CH004 for human CBS, which functions in vitro and in vivo. CH004 inhibits CBS activity, elevated the cellular homocysteine and suppressed the production of hydrogen sulfide in a dose-dependent manner in cells or in vivo. Chemical or genetic inhibition of CBS demonstrates that endogenous CBS is closely coupled with cell proliferation and cell cycle. Moreover, CH004 substantially retarded in vivo tumor growth in a xenograft mice model of liver cancer. Importantly, inhibition of CBS triggers ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, the study provides several clues for studying the interplays amongst transsulfuration pathway, ferroptosis and liver cancer.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is one of the 225 genes on chromosome 21 (HSA 21) that are triplicated in persons with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Although most triplicate HSA21 genes have their orthologous genes on murine chromosome 16, the murine ortholog of hCBS is on murine chromosome 17 and thus is not present in the well-studied Ts65Dn mouse model of trisomy 21. Persons with trisomy 21 (T21) present deficits in neurotransmission and exhibit early brain aging that can partially be explained by monoamine neurotransmitter alterations. We used transgenic mice for the hCBS gene, which overexpress the CBS protein in various brain regions, to study if CBS overexpression induces modifications in the monoamine neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and striatum from transgenic and control female and male mice aged 3-4 months and 11-12 months. Sex, age, and brain area each influenced neurotransmitter levels. Briefly, the serotonin pathway was modified by CBS overexpression in various brain areas in female mice but not in male mice. The dopamine pathway was modified in brain regions according to sex and age. These results may allow us to better understand the role of the transsulfuration pathway and especially CBS overexpression in the metabolism of biogenic amines and the catecholamine catabolism in persons with trisomy 21.</p>

<p>DL-2-hydroxy-4(methylthio) butanoic acid (DL-HMTBA) exhibits a higher antioxidant capability in vitro as compared to DL-Met, but the mechanism is still not known. A total of 400 8-day-old broiler chicks were allotted to a 2 [low (12 to 14°C) vs. control temperature (thermoneutral, 24 to 26°C)] × 2 (0.17% or 0.51% of DL-HMTBA) factorial arrangement to investigate effects of DL-HMTBA on antioxidant capacity and its related gene expression in lung and liver of broilers exposed to low temperature. The hepatic glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were decreased, whereas protein carbonyl and malodndialdehyde contents in lung were increased in low temperature (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 0.51% DL-HMTBA increased (P &lt; 0.05) GSH and GSH-Px activity in liver and SOD activity in lung in spite of the temperature. The greater gene expression of GSH reductase and lower expression of GSH synthetase (P &lt; 0.01) were observed in lung of broilers that were maintained at low temperature. Higher DL-HMTBA supplementation induced greater (P &lt; 0.05) mRNA expression of glutathione-S transferase in lung, GSH synthetase in liver and lung, as well as lower expression of GSH reductase in lung, and this effect were more obvious for the chicks exposed to low temperature (interaction, P &lt; 0.05). Chicks that were maintained under low temperature had the lower expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS), whereas those fed 0.51% DL-HMTBA increased the CßS expression in liver under low temperature (interaction, P = 0.05). The <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthetase and Met adenosyltransferase 1 (MAT1) gene expression were downregulated (P &lt; 0.05) by low temperature and the higher (P = 0.02) expression of MAT1 was observed in lung of chicks fed 0.51% DL-HMTBA. It indicated that under low temperature, DL-HMTBA supplementation at 0.51% upregulated gene expression of GSH synthesis and Met transsulfuration pathway in liver and lung to increase the antioxidant capacity, and then mitigate the negative effects of cold stress for broilers.</p>

<p>Disproportionate high intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the diet is considered as a major human health concern. The present study examines changes in the hepatic gene expression pattern of adult male zebrafish progeny associated with high levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA) in the parental diet. The parental generation (F0) was fed a diet which was either low (control) or high in ARA (high ARA). Progenies of both groups (F1) were given the control diet. No differences in body weight were found between the diet groups within adult stages of either F0 or F1 generation. Few differentially expressed genes were observed between the two dietary groups in the F0 in contrast to the F1 generation. Several links were found between the previous metabolic analysis of the parental fish and the gene expression analysis in their adult progeny. Main gene expression differences in the progeny were observed related to lipid and retinoid metabolism by PPARa/RXRa playing a central role in mediating changes to lipid and long-chain fatty acid metabolism. The enrichment of genes involved in ß-oxidation observed in the progeny, corresponded to the increase in peroxisomal ß-oxidative degradation of long-chain fatty acids in the parental fish metabolomics data. Similar links between the F0 and F1 generation were identified for the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway in the high ARA group. In addition, estrogen signalling was found to be affected by parental high dietary ARA levels, where gene expression was opposite directed in F1 compared to F0. This study shows that the dietary n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio can alter gene expression patterns in the adult progeny. Whether the effect is mediated by permanent epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in developing gametes needs to be further investigated.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder which is currently only diagnosed through behavioral testing. Impaired folate-dependent one carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transsulfuration (TS) pathways have been implicated in ASD, and recently a study involving multivariate analysis based upon Fisher Discriminant Analysis returned very promising results for predicting an ASD diagnosis. This article takes another step toward the goal of developing a biochemical diagnostic for ASD by comparing five classification algorithms on existing data of FOCM/TS metabolites, and also validating the classification results with new data from an ASD cohort. The comparison results indicate a high sensitivity and specificity for the original data set and up to a 88% correct classification of the ASD cohort at an expected 5% misclassification rate for typically-developing controls. These results form the foundation for the development of a biochemical test for ASD which promises to aid diagnosis of ASD and provide biochemical understanding of the disease, applicable to at least a subset of the ASD population.</p>

<p>Methionine is the precursor of homocysteine, a sulfur amino acid intermediate in the methylation and transsulfuration pathways; methionine-rich diets were used to induce hyperhomocysteinemia, and cardiovascular pathology was often observed. Other sulfur amino acids interfere with this metabolism, i.e., L-cysteine (Cys) and N-aceyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and probably also affect cardiovascular system. Their effects are controversial due to their ability to act both as anti- or pro-oxidant. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate their influence on levels of homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12, levels of different haemostatic parameters (fibrinogen, D-dimer, vWF Ag, vWF Ac) in rat serum or plasma as well as their effects on cardiac and aortic tissue histology in subchronically methionine-treated rats. Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 experimental groups: (a) control group (0.9% sodium chloride 0.1-0.2 mL/day) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10) (K); (b) DL-methionine (0.8 mmol/kg/bw/day) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10) (M); (c) DL-methionine (0.8 mmol/kg/bw/day)<U+2009>+<U+2009>L-cysteine (7 mg/kg/bw/day) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8) (C); (d) DL-methionine (0.8 mmol/ kg/bw/day)<U+2009>+<U+2009>N-acetyl-L-cysteine (50 mg/kg/bw/day) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8) (N). All substances were applied i.p., treatment duration 3 weeks. Lower levels of vitamin B12 in all the groups were found. Folate was reduced only in N group. Decreased fibrinogen was noted in C and N groups and increased D-dimer only in C. VWF activity was reduced in M and C groups. Deleterious effects in heart were observed, especially after Cys and NAC application. Aortic tissue remained unchanged. In conclusion, it could be said that sulfur amino acids have the significant impact on cardiovascular system in subchronically methionine-treated rats. This study points out the relevance of their complex interactions and deleterious effects mediated by either direct influence or procoagulant properties.</p>

<p>Dietary methionine (Met) restriction produces a coordinated series of transcriptional responses in the liver that limits growth performance and amino acid metabolism. Methyl donor supplementation with betaine (Bet) may protect against this disturbance and affect the molecular basis of gene regulation. However, a lack of genetic information remains an obstacle to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between Met and Bet supplementation and its effects on genetic mechanisms. The goal of this study was to identify the effects of dietary supplementation of Met and Bet on growth performance, transcriptomic gene expression, and epigenetic mechanisms in geese on a Met-deficient diet. One hundred and fifty 21-day-old healthy male Yangzhou geese of similar body weight were randomly distributed into 3 groups with 5 replicates per treatment and 10 geese per replicate: Met-deficient diet (Control), Control+1.2 g/kg of Met (Met), and Control+0.6 g/kg of Bet (Bet). All geese had free access to the diet and water throughout rearing. Our results indicated that supplementation of 1.2 g/kg of Met in Met-deficient feed increased growth performance and plasma homocysteine (HCY) levels, indicating increased transsulfuration flux in the liver. Supplementation of 0.6 g/kg Bet had no apparent sparing effect on Met needs for growth performance in growing geese. The expression of many genes critical for Met metabolism is increased in Met supplementation group. In the Bet-supplemented group, genes involved in energy production and conversion were up-regulated. Dietary supplementation with Bet and Met also altered DNA methylation. We observed changes in the methylation of the LOC106032502 promoter and corresponding changes in mRNA expression. In conclusion, Met and Bet supplementation in geese affects the transcriptional regulatory network and alters the hepatic DNA methylation of LOC106032502.</p>

<p>Pregnancy and early life are critical periods during which environmental factors such as nutrition can affect development. Rumen-protected methionine (Met; RPM) supplementation during the prepartum period improves not only performance but immune responses in dairy cows. We investigated the effects of enhanced maternal supply of Met via feeding RPM on whole-blood in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0, 0.01, or 5 µg/mL of blood) challenge and targeted microRNA and mRNA abundance in calf blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Calves (n = 12/maternal diet) born to cows fed RPM at 0.08% of diet dry matter (DM)/d (MET) for the last 21 ± 2 d before calving or fed a control diet with no added Met (CON) were used. The PMNL were isolated at birth (before colostrum feeding) and d 1 (24 h after colostrum intake), 14, 28, and 50 of age. Maternal blood was collected at -10 ± 1.3 d relative to calving. Cows in the MET group had greater DM intake and lower prepartal haptoglobin concentration. In CON cows, haptoglobin was positively correlated with proinflammatory and host-defense mRNA abundance in CON calves. Except for NOS2 and NFE2L2, abundance of CASP8, MPO, ZBP1, and TNF was lower at birth in MET calves. Interleukin 1ß concentration in response to LPS challenge in CON and MET calves was greatest at birth, underscoring the role of this cytokine for lymphocyte activation. Compared with 1 d of age, the interleukin-1ß response to incremental doses of LPS was greater at 14 through 28 d, suggesting that the neonatal calf can mount a robust response to inflammatory stimuli. Greater abundance in CON calves of NOS2, CADM1, and TLR2 coupled with lower SELL from 1 through 50 d of age suggested a chronic activation of the PMNL. There was a marked upregulation over time of MIR125b, MIR146a, MIR155, and MIR9 in both CON and MET calves, suggesting that these microRNA could affect gene transcription associated with differentiation and inflammatory function in PMNL. Regardless of maternal diet, the gradual downregulation of MIR223 (the most abundant microRNA in PMNL) is in line with the progressive increase over time in the proinflammatory signature of the PMNL. Data revealed the potential for maternal supply of Met during late pregnancy through either greater DM intake or Met to elicit some changes in PMNL function during early postnatal life, partly through changes in mRNA expression encompassing cell adhesion and chemotaxis, oxidative stress, Toll-like receptor signaling, and Met metabolism.</p>

<p>Overdose of acetaminophen (APAP) is a common cause of acute liver failure. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are related to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. This study investigated the protective role of betaine as a methyl donor and S-adenosylmethionine precursor against APAP hepatotoxicity in isolated mice liver mitochondria. We treated male NMRC mice with 125, 250, 500, and 1000<U+202F>mg/kg betaine for 5 days followed by 300<U+202F>mg/kg APAP 1<U+202F>h later. At 24<U+202F>h after APAP administration, animals were sacrificed and liver mitochondria were isolated by different centrifugation methods. Biochemical, histological and immunohistochemical analyses were then conducted. Pretreatment of mice with 250, 500, and 1000<U+202F>mg/kg betaine ameliorated hepatotoxicity (serum ALT and AST activity and histopathology finding); reversed mitochondrial complex II activity, glutathione level, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity, glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic protein expression, and mitochondrial membrane potential; and suppressed mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species. A contradictory effect was observed in mice treated with APAP. Betaine (500<U+202F>mg/kg) was chosen as the most effective dose to rescue APAP hepatotoxicity in mice. These findings confirmed that betaine plays a protective role against APAP hepatotoxicity via protecting mitochondrial complex II and regenerating mitochondrial GSH levels by increasing GCLC expression. Betaine displayed antioxidant actions different from other antioxidants via modifying cysteine supply in the transsulfuration pathway in the liver. These findings suggested the potential of betaine as an alternative agent for the treatment of hepatotoxicity induced by APAP.</p>

<p>One-carbon metabolism biomarkers are easily measured in plasma, but analyzing them one at a time in relation to disease does not take into account the interdependence of the many factors involved. The relative dynamics of major one-carbon metabolism branches can be assessed by relating the functional B-vitamin marker total homocysteine (tHcy) to transsulfuration (total cysteine) and methylation (creatinine) outputs. We validated the ratios of tHcy to total cysteine (Hcy:Cys), tHcy to creatinine (Hcy:Cre) and tHcy to cysteine to creatinine (Hcy:Cys:Cre) as functional markers of B-vitamin status. We also calculated the associations of these ratios to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Furthermore, the relative contribution of potential confounders to the variance of the ratio-based B-vitamin markers was calculated by linear regression in a nested case-control study of 613 CRC cases and 1,190 matched controls. Total B-vitamin status was represented by a summary score comprising Z-standardized plasma concentrations of folate, cobalamin, betaine, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate and riboflavin. Associations with CRC risk were estimated using conditional logistic regression. We found that the ratio-based B-vitamin markers all outperformed tHcy as markers of total B-vitamin status, in both CRC cases and controls. In addition, associations with CRC risk were similar for the ratio-based B-vitamin markers and total B-vitamin status (approximately 25% lower risk for high vs. low B-vitamin status). In conclusion, ratio-based B-vitamin markers were good predictors of total B-vitamin status and displayed similar associations as total B-vitamin status with CRC risk. Since tHcy and creatinine are routinely clinically analyzed, Hcy:Cre could be easily implemented in clinical practice.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cystathionine is a thio-ether and a metabolite formed from homocysteine during transsulfuration. Elevated plasma cystathionine levels are reported in patients with cardiovascular disease; however prospective relationships with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are unknown. We investigated associations between plasma cystathionine and AMI among patients with suspected and/or verified coronary heart disease (CHD).METHODS: Subjects from two independent cohort studies, the Western Norway Coronary Angiography Cohort (WECAC) (3033 patients with stable angina pectoris; 263 events within 4.8<U+202F>years of median follow-up) and the Norwegian Vitamin Trial (NORVIT) (3670 patients with AMI; 683 events within 3.2<U+202F>years of median follow-up) were included.CONCLUSIONS: Plasma cystathionine is associated with increased risk of AMI among patients with either suspected or verified coronary heart disease, and is possibly related to altered redox homeostasis.</p>

<p>Cysteine is a nonessential amino acid in poultry nutrition. Poultry diets are deficient in cysteine, but the bird’s cysteine need is met through the transsulfuration pathway (TSP) where homocysteine is converted to cysteine: a process catalyzed by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). Cysteine is also a major component of keratinized protein found in feathers, but the extent to which cysteine is involved in feather and skin development in poultry is unknown. We randomly assigned chicks to control and treatment (control diet plus 100<U+2009>mg/kg body weight of propargylglycine which is an inhibitor of CTH) diets. The thickness of skin layers, primary feather follicle parameters, growth, and mRNA expression of CBS and CTH were measured. Inhibition of TSP corresponded with the upregulation of liver mRNA of both CBS and CTH and reduction in growth from 35 to 40 days of age. The epidermis thickness, feather follicle length, and diameter were reduced from 10 to 40 days of age. Incorporation of cysteine into keratinized protein may be more sensitive to the level of available cysteine than into nonkeratinized proteins. Thus, disruption of the TSP could affect the thermoregulatory ability of the bird.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial function affects many aspects of cellular physiology, and, most recently, its role in epigenetics has been reported. Mechanistically, how mitochondrial function alters DNA methylation patterns in the nucleus remains ill defined. Using a cell culture model of induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, in this study we show that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an early transcriptional and metabolic program centered on the metabolism of various amino acids, including those involved in the methionine cycle. We find that this program also increases DNA methylation, which occurs primarily in the genes that are differentially expressed. Maintenance of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) oxidation in the context of mtDNA loss rescues methionine salvage and polyamine synthesis and prevents changes in DNA methylation and gene expression but does not affect serine/folate metabolism or transsulfuration. This work provides a novel mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and epigenetic regulation of gene expression that involves polyamine and methionine metabolism responding to changes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Given the implications of these findings, future studies across different physiological contexts and in vivo are warranted.</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANCE: Once considered to be mere by-products of metabolism, reactive oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur species are now recognized to play important roles in diverse cellular processes such as response to pathogens and regulation of cellular differentiation. It is becoming increasingly evident that redox imbalance can impact several signaling pathways. For instance, disturbances of redox regulation in the brain mediate neurodegeneration and alter normal cytoprotective responses to stress. Very often small disturbances in redox signaling processes, which are reversible, precede damage in neurodegeneration. Recent Advances: The identification of redox-regulated processes, such as regulation of biochemical pathways involved in the maintenance of redox homeostasis in the brain has provided deeper insights into mechanisms of neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. Recent studies have also identified several post-translational modifications involving reactive cysteine residues, such as nitrosylation and sulfhydration, which fine-tune redox regulation. Thus, the study of mechanisms via which cell death occurs in several neurodegenerative disorders, reveal several similarities and dissimilarities. Here, we review redox regulated events that are disrupted in neurodegenerative disorders and whose modulation affords therapeutic opportunities.CRITICAL ISSUES: Although accumulating evidence suggests that redox imbalance plays a significant role in progression of several neurodegenerative diseases, precise understanding of redox regulated events is lacking. Probes and methodologies that can precisely detect and quantify in vivo levels of reactive oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur species are not available.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Due to the importance of redox control in physiologic processes, organisms have evolved multiple pathways to counteract redox imbalance and maintain homeostasis. Cells and tissues address stress by harnessing an array of both endogenous and exogenous redox active substances. Targeting these pathways can help mitigate symptoms associated with neurodegeneration and may provide avenues for novel therapeutics. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 30, 1450-1499.</p>

<p>Over the past seven decades, research on autotrophic and heterotrophic model organisms has defined how the flow of electrons (“reducing power”) from high-energy inorganic sources, through biological systems, to low-energy inorganic products like water, powers all of Life’s processes. Universally, an initial major biological recipient of these electrons is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-phosphate, which thereby transits from an oxidized state (NADP<sup>+</sup>) to a reduced state (NADPH). A portion of this reducing power is then distributed via the cellular NADPH-dependent disulfide reductase systems as sequential reductions of disulfide bonds. Along the disulfide reduction pathways, some enzymes have active sites that use the selenium-containing amino acid, selenocysteine, in place of the common but less reactive sulfur-containing cysteine. In particular, the mammalian/metazoan thioredoxin systems are usually selenium-dependent as, across metazoan phyla, most thioredoxin reductases are selenoproteins. Among the roles of the NADPH-dependent disulfide reductase systems, the most universal is that they provide the reducing power for the production of DNA precursors by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Some studies, however, have uncovered examples of NADPH-independent disulfide reductase systems that can also support RNR. These systems are summarized here and their implications are discussed.</p>

<p>Selenoprotein P (SelenoP) functions as a plasma transporter of selenium (Se) from liver to other tissues via incorporation into multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues. Selenocysteine lyase (Scly) is an intracellular enzyme that decomposes Sec into selenide, providing Se for the synthesis of new selenoproteins. Both SelenoP and Scly are mostly produced by the liver. Previous studies demonstrated that male mice lacking SelenoP (SelenoP KO) or Scly (Scly KO) had increased or decreased total hepatic Se, respectively. While SelenoP regulation by Se is well-studied, Scly regulation by Se has not been reported. We hypothesize that Scly is negatively regulated by Se levels, and that absence of SelenoP jeopardizes Scly-dependent Se recycling. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we unveiled a tissue-specific Se regulation of Scly gene expression. We also determined that SelenoP, a considered source of intracellular Se, affects Scly expression and activity in vitro but not in vivo, as in the absence of SelenoP, Scly levels and activity remain normal. We also showed that absence of SelenoP does not increase levels of transsulfuration pathway enzymes, which would result in available selenocompounds being decomposed by the actions of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL or CTH) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Instead, it affects levels of thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1), an enzyme that can reduce selenite to selenide to be used in selenoprotein production. This study evaluates a potential interplay between SelenoP and Scly, providing further insights into the regulation of selenium metabolism.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, homocysteine has been regarded as a marker of cardiovascular disease and a definite risk factor for many other diseases. Homocysteine is biosynthesized from methionine through multiple steps and then goes through one of two major metabolic pathways: remethylation and transsulfuration. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a state in which too much homocysteine is present in the body. The main cause of hyperhomocysteinemia is a dysfunction of enzymes and cofactors associated with the process of homocysteine biosynthesis. Other causes include excessive methionine intake, certain diseases and side effects of some drugs. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a trigger for many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and hearing loss. There are many studies showing a positive relationship between homocysteine level and various symptoms. We speculate that a high level of homocysteine can be the sole reason or an aggravating factor in numerous diseases for which causal links are not fully understood.</p>

<p>Phenylketonuria is a defect in phenylalanine metabolism resulting in the excretion of phenylketones and severe intellectual disability. The principle of eliminating the offending amino acid from the diet as a successful treatment strategy was demonstrated. The development of a low methionine diet to treat homocystinuria was established after identifying the transsulfuration pathway resulting in cysteine synthesis. Both conditions are examples of disorders of amino acid metabolism. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare disorder of purine metabolism resulting in intellectual disability and self-injurious behavior, is a classical inborn error of metabolism. Disorders of creatine biosynthesis are relatively newly described and less known diseases.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a wide-ranging collection of developmental diseases with varying symptoms and degrees of disability. Currently, ASD is diagnosed mainly with psychometric tools, often unable to provide an early and reliable diagnosis. Recently, biochemical methods are being explored as a means to meet the latter need. For example, an increased predisposition to ASD has been associated with abnormalities of metabolites in folate-dependent one carbon metabolism (FOCM) and transsulfuration (TS). Multiple metabolites in the FOCM/TS pathways have been measured, and statistical analysis tools employed to identify certain metabolites that are closely related to ASD. The prime difficulty in such biochemical studies comes from (i) inefficient determination of which metabolites are most important and (ii) understanding how these metabolites are collectively related to ASD. This paper presents a new method based on scores produced in Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling combined with High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) sensitivity analysis. The new method effectively and efficiently identifies the key causative metabolites in FOCM/TS pathways, ranks their importance, and discovers their independent and correlative action patterns upon ASD. Such information is valuable not only for providing a foundation for a pathological interpretation but also for potentially providing an early, reliable diagnosis ideally leading to a subsequent comprehensive treatment of ASD. With only tens of SVM model runs, the new method can identify the combinations of the most important metabolites in the FOCM/TS pathways that lead to ASD. Previous efforts to find these metabolites required hundreds of thousands of model runs with the same data.</p>

<p>The association between conotruncal heart defects (CTHDs) and maternal genetic and environmental exposures is well studied. However, little is known about paternal genetic or environmental exposures and risk of CTHDs. We assessed the effect of paternal genetic variants in the folate, homocysteine, and transsulfuration pathways on risk of CTHDs in offspring. We utilized National Birth Defects Prevention Study data to conduct a family-based case only study using 616 live-born infants with CTHDs, born October 1997-August 2008. Maternal, paternal and infant DNA was genotyped using an Illumina® Golden Gate custom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from log-linear models determined parent of origin effects for 921 SNPs in 60 candidate genes involved in the folate, homocysteine, and transsulfuration pathways on risk of CTHDs. The risk of CTHD among children who inherited a paternally derived copy of the A allele on GLRX (rs17085159) or the T allele of GLRX (rs12109442) was 0.23 (95%CI: 0.12, 0.42; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.09<U+2009>×<U+2009>10<sup>-6</sup> ) and 0.27 (95%CI: 0.14, 0.50; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.06<U+2009>×<U+2009>10<sup>-5</sup> ) times the risk among children who inherited a maternal copy of the same allele. The paternally inherited copy of the GSR (rs7818511) A allele had a 0.31 (95%CI: 0.18, 0.53; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.94<U+2009>×<U+2009>10<sup>-6</sup> ] risk of CTHD compared to children with the maternal copy of the same allele. The risk of CTHD is less influenced by variants in paternal genes involved in the folate, homocysteine, or transsulfuration pathways than variants in maternal genes in those pathways.</p>

<p>In this study, an acute overloading of methionine (MetLo) was used to investigate the trassulfuration pathway response comparing healthy controls and HIV+ patients under their usual diet and dietary N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) supplementation. MetLo (0.1 g Met/kg mass weight) was given after overnight fasting to 20 non-HIV+ control subjects (Co) and 12 HIV+ HAART-treated patients. Blood samples were taken before and after the MetLo in two different 7-day dietary situations, with NAC (1 g/day) or with their usual diet (UD). The amino acids (Met, Hcy, Cys, Tau, Ser, Glu and Gln) and GSH were determined by HPLC and their inflow rate into circulation (plasma) was estimated by the area under the curve (AUC). Under UD, the HIV+ had lower plasma GSH and amino acids (excepting Hcy) and higher oxidative stress (GSSG/GSH ratio), similar remethylation (RM: Me/Hcy + Ser ratio), transmethylation (TM; Hcy/Met ratio) and glutaminogenesis (Glu/Gln ratio), lower transsulfuration (TS: Cys/Hcy + Ser ratio) and Cys/Met ratio and, higher synthetic rates of glutathione (GG: GSH/Cys ratio) and Tau (TG: Tau/Cys ratio). NAC supplementation changed the HIV pattern by increasing RM above control, normalizing plasma Met and TS and, increasing plasma GSH and GG above controls. However, plasma Cys was kept always below controls probably, associatively to its higher consumption in GG (more GSSG than GSH) and TG. The failure of restoring normal Cys by MetLo, in addition to NAC, in HIV+ patients seems to be related to increased flux of Cys into GSH and Tau pathways, probably strengthening the cell-antioxidant capacity against the HIV progression (registered at <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" class="uri">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> , NCT00910442).</p>

<p>PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the effects of different intensities of acute exercise on Hcy plasma levels, and the exercise-induced changes in Hcy liver metabolism.METHOD: First, thirty-two Wistar rats were randomly submitted to an acute bout of swimming exercise carrying a load of 2% (n=8), 4% (n=8) and 6% (n=8) of their total body weight attached in their tail. Control rats remained rested (n=8). Blood samples were taken from tail vein for plasma S-containing amino acids determination before (Rest) and post, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10h after acute swimming exercise. Second, 56 exercised rats (4% loads) were euthanized before (Rest) and1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10h after acute swimming exercise. Blood and liver samples were collected for amino acids and keys genes involved in the Hcy metabolism assay.RESULTS: Acute exercise increases (P&lt;0.05) plasma Hcy concentration in an intensity-dependent manner (rest 7.7±0.8; 6% load 13.8±3.6; 4% load 12.2±2.9±and 2% load 10.1±2.6, µmol/L); this increase is transient and does not promote hyperhomocysteinemia (&lt;15µmol/L).Exercise-induced increased plasma Hcywas accompanied by the decreased liver S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio and elevated MAT1a mRNA content. Acute exercise also caused elevated mRNA of key enzymes of transsulfuration (CBS) and remethylation (BHMT and the MTRR).CONCLUSION: Our data provided evidence that acute exercise increases plasma Hcy concentration due to the augmented requirement for methylated compounds that increases liver SAM consumption. Also, Hcy remethylation and transsulfuration are coordinately regulated to maintain methyl balance.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), the key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, links methionine metabolism to the biosynthesis of cellular redox controlling molecules. CBS catalyzes the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine, which is subsequently converted into cysteine. Besides maintaining cellular sulfur amino acid homeostasis, CBS also catalyzes multiple hydrogen sulfide-generating reactions using cysteine and homocysteine as substrates. In mammals, CBS is activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), where it can adopt two different conformations (basal and activated), but exists as a unique highly active species in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present the crystal structure of CBS from honeybey Apis mellifera, which shows a constitutively active dimeric species and let explain why the enzyme is not allosterically regulated by AdoMet. In addition, comparison of available CBS structures unveils a substrate-induced closure of the catalytic cavity, which in humans is affected by the AdoMet-dependent regulation and likely impaired by the homocystinuria causing mutation T191M.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide is a gaseous signaling molecule or gasotransmitter which plays important roles in a wide spectrum of physiologic processes in the brain and peripheral tissues. Unlike nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, the other major gasotransmitters, research on hydrogen sulfide is still in its infancy. One of the modes by which hydrogen sulfide signals is via a posttranslational modification termed sulfhydration/persulfidation, which occurs on reactive cysteine residues on target proteins, where the reactive SH group is converted to an SSH group. Sulfhydration is a substantially prevalent modification, which modulates the structure or function of proteins being modified. Thus, precise control of endogenous hydrogen sulfide production and metabolism is critical for maintenance of optimal cellular function, with excess generation and paucity, both contributing to pathology. Dysregulation of the reverse transsulfuration pathway which generates hydrogen sulfide occurs in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Accordingly, treatment with donors of hydrogen sulfide or stimulation of the reverse transsulfuration have proved beneficial in several neurodegenerative states. In this review we focus on hydrogen sulfide mediated neuronal signaling processes that contribute to neuroprotection.</p>

<p>Transsulfuration allows conversion of methionine into cysteine using homocysteine (Hcy) as an intermediate. This pathway produces S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a key metabolite for cell function, and provides 50% of the cysteine needed for hepatic glutathione synthesis. The route requires the intake of essential nutrients (e.g., methionine and vitamins) and is regulated by their availability. Transsulfuration presents multiple interconnections with epigenetics, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and glutathione synthesis, polyol and pentose phosphate pathways, and detoxification that rely mostly in the exchange of substrates or products. Major hepatic diseases, rare diseases, and sensorineural disorders, among others that concur with oxidative stress, present impaired transsulfuration. Recent Advances: In contrast to the classical view, a nuclear branch of the pathway, potentiated under oxidative stress, is emerging. Several transsulfuration proteins regulate gene expression, suggesting moonlighting activities. In addition, abnormalities in Hcy metabolism link nutrition and hearing loss.</AbstractText>: Transsulfuration allows conversion of methionine into cysteine using homocysteine (Hcy) as an intermediate.

<p>We elucidated a unique feature of sulfur metabolism in Cryptococcus neoformans. C. neoformans produces cysteine solely by the O-acetylserine pathway that consists of serine-O-acetyl transferase and cysteine synthase. We designated the gene encoding the former enzyme CYS2 (locus tag CNE02740) and the latter enzyme CYS1 (locus tag CNL05880). The cys1<U+0394>mutant strain was found to be avirulent in a murine infection model. Methionine practically does not support growth of the cys1<U+0394> strain, and cysteine does not serve as a methionine source, indicating that the transsulfuration pathway does not contribute to sulfur amino acid synthesis in C. neoformans. Among the genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the reactions from homoserine to methionine, the gene corresponding to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MET17 encoding O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase (Met17p) had remained to be identified in C. neoformans. By genetic analysis of Met<sup>-</sup> mutants obtained by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated mutagenesis, we concluded that Cnc01220, most similar to Str2p (36% identity), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-synthase, in the Saccharomyces genome, is the C. neoformans version of O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase. We designated CNC01220 as MET17. The C. neoformans met3<U+0394> mutant defective in the first step of the sulfate assimilation pathway, sulfate adenylyltransferase, barely uses methionine as a sulfur source, whereas it uses cysteine efficiently. The poor utilization of methionine by the met3<U+0394> mutant is most probably due to the absence of the transsulfuration pathway, causing an incapability of C. neoformans to produce cysteine and hydrogen sulfide from methionine. When cysteine is used as a sulfur source, methionine is likely produced de novo by using hydrogen sulfide derived from cysteine via an unidentified pathway. Altogether, the unique features of sulfur amino acid metabolism in C. neoformans will make this fungus a valuable experimental system to develop anti-fungal agents and to investigate physiology of hydrogen sulfide.</p>

<p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which sets the stage for further liver damage. The mechanism for the progression of NASH involves multiple parallel hits including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and others. Manipulation of any of these pathways may be an approach to prevent NASH development and progression. Aramchol (arachidyl-amido cholanoic acid) is presently in a phase IIb NASH study. The aim of this study was to investigate Aramchol’s mechanism of action and its effect on fibrosis using the methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet model of NASH. We collected liver and serum from mice fed a MCD diet containing 0.1% methionine (0.1MCD) for four weeks, which developed steatohepatitis and fibrosis, as well as mice receiving a control diet; the metabolomes and proteomes were determined. 0.1MCD fed mice were given Aramchol (5mg/kg/day for the last 2 weeks); liver samples were analyzed histologically. Aramchol administration reduced features of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in 0.1MCD fed mice. Aramchol downregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), a key enzyme involved in triglyceride biosynthesis whose loss enhances fatty acid ß-oxidation. Aramchol increased the flux through the transsulfuration pathway, leading to a rise in glutathione (GSH) and GSH/GSSG ratio, the main cellular antioxidant that maintains intracellular redox status. Comparison of serum metabolomic pattern between 0.1MCD fed mice and NAFLD patients showed a substantial overlap.Aramchol treatment improved steatohepatitis and fibrosis by 1) decreasing SCD1, and 2) increasing the flux through the transsulfuration pathway maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. We also demonstrated that the 0.1MCD model resembles the metabolic phenotype observed in about 50% of NAFLD patients, which supports the potential use of Aramchol in NASH treatment.</AbstractText>: Aramchol treatment improved steatohepatitis and fibrosis by 1) decreasing SCD1, and 2) increasing the flux through the transsulfuration pathway maintaining cellular redox homeostasis.

<p>The substantial rise in the prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and the strong association between NASH and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma indicate the urgent need for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, by using the Stelic animal model of NASH and NASH-derived liver carcinogenesis, we investigated the role of the folate-dependent 1-carbon metabolism in the pathogenesis of NASH. We demonstrated that advanced NASH and NASH-related liver carcinogenesis are characterized by a significant dysregulation of 1-carbon homeostasis, with diminished expression of key 1-carbon metabolism genes, especially a marked inhibition of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase ( Ahcy) gene and an increased level of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH). The reduction in Ahcy expression was associated with gene-specific cytosine DNA hypermethylation and enrichment of the gene promoter by trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 and deacetylated histone H4 lysine 16, 2 main transcription-inhibiting markers. These results indicate that epigenetically mediated inhibition of Ahcy expression may be a driving force in causing SAH elevation and subsequent downstream disturbances in transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways during the development and progression of NASH.-Pogribny, I.

<p>Hyper- and hypothyroidism are some of the most common endocrinopathies that cause many metabolic disorders including amino acids metabolism. However, a specific molecular mechanism of thyroid hormones influence on sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism has not been established. The aim of our research was to investigate experimentally the influence of thyroid gland functional state on the main enzymatic systems of sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism in liver and kidneys, the content of homocysteine, cysteine and H2S in blood. The rats were administered with L-thyroxine and mercazolil to simulate the states of hyper- and hypothyroidism, which were confirmed by the content of fT3, fT4 and TSH in the blood. In liver and kidneys of the animals with hypothyroidism we observed the decrease in the activity of enzymes of remethylation cycle of S-adenosylmethioninsyntase, S-adenosylhomocysteinhyhdrolase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. Suppression of transsulfuration transformation of homocysteine to cysteine in hypothyroidism was mainly due to the inhibition of cystathionine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase, wherein cystathionase activity of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase was not changed. In animals with hypothyroidism we also noticed the inhibition of cysteine desulfunation reactions: the activity of enzymes of cystathionine-ß-synthase, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase and cysteine aminotransferase significantly decreased in liver and kidneys. Experimental hyperthyroidism was accompanied by increase in activity of remethylation cycle enzymes, increase in cystationine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase in liver and activity of these enzymes in kidneys. The simulation of hyperthyroidism led to the decrease of homocysteine concentration, and of hypothyroidism - to the increase of homocysteine and cysteine concentrations and reduced H2S content in blood of the animals. Thus, the significant risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulation in hypothyroid conditions may be the disorders in the processes of remethylation, transsulfuration, and desulfuration of sulphur-containing amino acids in organs.</p>

<p>Extracellular cystine, the oxidized form of cysteine (Cys), is taken up by cells via the cystine transporter xCT. xCT is not expressed in the liver but is induced in primary hepatocytes under conventional cultured conditions. However, compared to wild-type hepatocytes those from the xCT-knockout mouse showed no evidence of an abnormality and the levels of both Cys and glutathione (GSH) remained unchanged. The levels of ophthalmic acid (OPT), which is produced as an alternative compound by the GSH-synthesizing pathway, became increased during the culturing of hepatocytes. It therefore appears that, in primary hepatocytes, Cys is provided by systems other than xCT, most likely via the transsulfuration pathway, but the levels that are produced are not sufficient. We also employed mouse hepatoma-derived Hepa1-6 cells, which constitutively express xCT. When Hepa 1-6 cells were cultivated in Cys-free media, the levels of intracellular Cys and GSH were decreased, compared to cells cultured in conventional media, leading to cell death accompanied by an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation products with characteristics similar to ferroptosis. While OPT levels were increased by only to a limited extent in Hepa 1-6 cells, primary hepatocytes cultured in Cys- and Met-free media showed a marked elevation in OPT, reaching levels nearly equivalent to the GSH levels when the cells were cultured in conventional media. Thus, OPT may become a marker for Cys insufficiency and might be used to predict pathological conditions of cells with elevated oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is a progressive disease of multifactorial origin, which occurs in response to endothelial injury. Increased homocysteine (Hcy) is considered a major cause of endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and DNA methylation; however, the mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Hcy causes injury to endothelial cells (ECs) by the effect of lectin-like oxidized-low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) DNA methylation through toll-like receptor 4(TLR4)/nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B/DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1. The ECs were treated with different concentrations of Hcy, and it was found that Hcy promoted the expression of TLR4, leading to EC injury. The effect of oxidative stress was analyzed by measuring superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide in the ECs. In addition, the association between NF-<U+03BA>B and DNMT1 was examined by treatment of the ECs with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). The results suggested that Hcy induced LOX-1 DNA hypomethyaltion to promote the expression levels of LOX-1. Taken together, Hcy injured the ECs through the effect of methylation and trans-sulfuration metabolism of LOX-1 through TLR4/NF-<U+03BA>B/DNMT1. Following injury to the ECs, lipids, particularly ox-LDL, accumulated in the sub-endothelial layer to promote the formation of AS.</p>

<p>Anticoagulant therapy is prescribed to millions of patients worldwide for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis. Evidence has indicated that edoxaban is a potential drug of oral anticoagulant in the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism. Hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine plasma concentration are indicators of cardiovascular and neurovascular disease risk factors that have attracted considerable attention for regulation of vascular health and homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanism of edoxaban-mediated differences of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine has not been investigated in the progression of venous thrombosis. In the present study, the authors analyzed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in the vein endothelial cells and expression levels of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine. Homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism through transsulfuration and that transsulfuration capacity and hydrogen sulfide availability have been investigated both in vitro and in vivo following treatment with edoxaban. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) levels were studied in a cell model and rat model of vein thrombosis prior and post treatment of edoxaban. The therapeutic effects of edoxaban for rats with vein thrombosis were determined by clinical diagnose scores. The results demonstrated that edoxaban increased expression levels of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine in microvascular endothelial cells. It was observed that the transsulfuration enzymes, CBS and CGL levels were upregulated in murine microvascular endothelial cells. The MMP-9 expression level and activity and homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism were increased in murine microvascular endothelial cells following edoxaban treatment. In addition, CBS and CGL activities were upregulated in murine microvascular endothelial cells and a rat model of venous thrombosis following treatment with edoxaban. Furthermore, it was observed that edoxaban increased PI3K and AKT expression both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, edoxaban significantly improved endothelial injury and inhibited thrombosis factors expression in rat model of venous thrombosis. In conclusion, these findings suggested that edoxaban can improve venous thrombosis by decreasing hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Protein-depleted states generate allosteric inhibition of liver cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), which governs the first enzymatic step of the transsulfuration cascade, resulting in upstream accretion of homocysteine (Hcy) in body fluids. A similar Hcy increase may arise from normal hepatocytes undergoing experimentally-induced impairment of betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHTM) activity or from components of lean body mass (LBM) submitted to any inflammatory disorder. LBM comprises a composite agglomeration of extrarenal tissues characterized by naturally occurring BHTM inactivity. As a result of cellular injury, LBM releases high concentrations of Hcy into the extracellular space, contrasting with the disruption of normal remethylation pathways. Hyperhomocysteinemia acts as a biomarker, reflecting the severity of insult and operating as an alarm signal. Elevated Hcy levels constitute a precursor pool recognized by a CBS coding region that reacts to meet increased methionine requirements in LBM tissues, using its enhanced production in hepatocytes. Preservation of methionine homeostasis benefits from its high metabolic priority and survival value.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the transsulfuration pathway and contributes, among other functions, to the generation of hydrogen sulfide. In view of the exceptionally high expression of CBS in the liver and the common interleukin-6 pathway used in the regulatory systems of hydrogen sulfide and hepcidin, we speculate that CBS is involved in body iron homeostasis. We found that CBS knockout (CBS<sup>-/-</sup> ) mice exhibited anemia and a significant increase in iron content in the serum, liver, spleen, and heart, along with severe damage to the liver, displaying a hemochromatosis-like phenotype. A high level of hepatic and serum hepcidin was also found. A major cause of the systemic iron overload is the reduced iron usage due to suppressed erythropoiesis, which is consistent with an increase in interleukin-6 and reduced expression of erythropoietin. Importantly, in the liver, absence of CBS caused both a reduction in the transcriptional factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and an up-regulation of hepcidin that led to a decrease in the iron export protein ferroportin 1. The resulting suppression of iron export exacerbates iron retention, causing damage to hepatocytes. Finally, administration of CBS-overexpressing adenovirus into CBS mutant mice could partially reverse the iron-related phenotype.Our findings point to a critical role of CBS in iron homeostasis of the body, and the liver in particular; it is likely that a hemochromatosis-like phenotype in patients can be induced by aberration not only in the expression of key molecules in the hepcidin pathway but also of those related to CBS. (Hepatology 2018;67:21-35).</AbstractText>: Our findings point to a critical role of CBS in iron homeostasis of the body, and the liver in particular; it is likely that a hemochromatosis-like phenotype in patients can be induced by aberration not only in the expression of key molecules in the hepcidin pathway but also of those related to CBS.

<p>This review discusses the current understanding of cysteine and glutathione redox balance in astrocytes. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of oxidative stress and astrocyte activation on pathways that provide cysteine as a precursor for glutathione. The effect of the disruption of thiol-containing amino acid metabolism on the antioxidant capacity of astrocytes is also discussed.</p>

<p>Glutathione (GSH) plays pivotal roles in antioxidation and detoxification. The transsulfuration pathway, in conjunction with methionine metabolism, produces equimolar amounts of cysteine (Cys) and 2-oxobutyric acid (2OB). The resulting 2OB is then converted into 2-aminobutyric acid (2AB) by a transaminase and is utilized as a substitute for Cys by the GSH-synthesizing machinery to produce ophthalmic acid (OPT). By establishing a method for simultaneously measuring Cys, GSH, and OPT by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we found that fasting causes an elevation in OPT levels in the liver and blood plasma, even though the levels of Cys and GSH are decreased. Autophagy was activated, but the levels of GSH/OPT-synthesizing enzymes remained unchanged. After 6 h of fasting, the mice were given 1% 2AB and/or 5% glucose in the drinking water for an additional 24 h and the above metabolites analyzed. 2AB administration caused an increase in OPT levels, and, when glucose was co-administered with 2AB, the levels of OPT were elevated further but GSH levels were decreased somewhat. These results suggest that, while Cys is utilized for glyconeogenesis under fasting conditions, reaching levels that were insufficient for the synthesis of GSH, 2OB was preferentially converted to 2AB via amino acid catabolism and was utilized as a building block for OPT. Thus the consumption of Cys and the parallel elevation of 2AB under fasting conditions appeared to force <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthetase to form <U+03B3>-glutamyl-2AB, despite the fact that the enzyme has a higher Km value for 2AB than Cys.</p>

<p>AIMS: Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) is the common pathway of progressive chronic kidney disease. Inflammation has been widely accepted as the major driving force of TIF. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway. CBS is considered to play protective role in liver and pulmonary fibrosis, but its role in TIF remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role and mechanism of CBS in renal inflammation and TIF.METHODS: Renal function, tubulointerstitium damage index score, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and the expressions of collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, CD3, CD68, IL-1ß, TNF-a were measured in sham operation and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) rats. Proteomics and gene array analysis were performed to screen differentially expressed molecules in the development of renal inflammation and TIF in UUO rats. The expression of CBS was detected in patients with obstructive nephropathy and UUO rats. We confirmed the expression of CBS using western blot and real-time PCR in HK-2 cells. Overexpression plasmid and siRNA were transfected specifically to study the possible function of CBS in HK-2 cells.RESULTS: Abundant expression of CBS, localized in renal tubular epithelial cells, was revealed in human and rat renal tissue, which correlated negatively with the progression of fibrotic disease. Expression of CBS was dramatically decreased in the obstructed kidney from UUO rats as compared with the sham group (SHM). In addition, knocking down CBS exacerbated extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, whereas CBS overexpression attenuated TGF-ß1-induced ECM deposition in vitro. Inflammatory and chemotactic factors were also increased in CBS knockdown HK-2 cells stimulated by IL-1ß.CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish CBS as a novel inhibitor in renal fibrosis and as a new therapeutic target in patients with chronic kidney disease.</p>

<p>Background Oxidative stress (OS) represents the primary mediator of chronic heart failure (CHF) development and progression. It is well established that homocysteine is able to generate reactive oxygen species. Small amounts of allantoin in human serum result from free radical action on urate and may provide a stable marker for in vivo free radical activity. To investigate whether some easily measurable indexes such as antioxidants (uric acid, glutathione) and related molecules (allantoin, homocysteine and cysteine) can serve as OS biomarkers. Methods We investigated 75 stable CHF patients. Aminothiols and purine compound levels were determined by capillary electrophoresis. Results The homocysteine level was markedly elevated in CHF patients, whatever the aetiology. Parameters of the transsulfuration pathway and the investigated purine compounds were significantly increased. Conversely, total glutathione was decreased. The allantoin/uric acid ratio was significantly higher in CHF patients with an hyperhomocysteinaemia &gt;17<U+202F>µmol/L. All parameters of the transsulfuration and purine degadation pathways were significantly correlated, suggesting an OS in CHF patients. Conclusion Our data show an imbalance of serum aminothiols and purine compounds in these CHF patients on adapted therapy. We suggest that the evaluation and control of these new markers may help improve the OS that participates in the progression of the disease.</p>

<p>Energetic nutrients are oxidized to sustain high intracellular NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratios. NADPH-dependent reduction of thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) disulfide and glutathione disulfide by thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) and glutathione reductase (Gsr), respectively, fuels antioxidant systems and deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Mouse livers lacking both TrxR1 and Gsr sustain these essential activities using an NADPH-independent methionine-consuming pathway; however, it remains unclear how this reducing power is distributed. Here, we show that liver-specific co-disruption of the genes encoding Trx1, TrxR1, and Gsr (triple-null) causes dramatic hepatocyte hyperproliferation. Thus, even in the absence of Trx1, methionine-fueled glutathione production supports hepatocyte S phase deoxyribonucleotide production. Also, Trx1 in the absence of TrxR1 provides a survival advantage to cells under hyperglycemic stress, suggesting that glutathione, likely via glutaredoxins, can reduce Trx1 disulfide in vivo. In triple-null livers like in many cancers, deoxyribonucleotide synthesis places a critical yet relatively low-volume demand on these reductase systems, thereby favoring high hepatocyte turnover over sustained hepatocyte integrity.</p>

<p>The filamentous ascomycete Acremonium chrysogenum is the only industrial producer of the ß-lactam antibiotic cephalosporin C. Synthesis of all ß-lactam antibiotics starts with the three amino acids l-a-aminoadipic acid, l-cysteine and l-valine condensing to form the d-(l-a-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine tripeptide. The availability of building blocks is essential in every biosynthetic process and is therefore one of the most important parameters required for optimal biosynthetic production. Synthesis of l-cysteine is feasible by various biosynthetic pathways in all euascomycetes, and sequencing of the Acr. chrysogenum genome has shown that a full set of sulfur-metabolizing genes is present. In principle, two pathways are effective: an autotrophic one, where the sulfur atom is taken from assimilated sulfide to synthesize either l-cysteine or l-homocysteine, and a reverse transsulfuration pathway, where l-methionine is the sulfur donor. Previous research with production strains has focused on reverse transsulfuration, and concluded that both l-methionine and reverse transsulfuration are essential for high-level cephalosporin C synthesis. Here, we conducted molecular genetic analysis with A3/2, another production strain, to investigate the autotrophic pathway. Strains lacking either cysteine synthase or homocysteine synthase, enzymes of the autotrophic pathway, are still autotrophic for sulfur. However, deletion of both genes results in sulfur amino acid auxotrophic mutants exhibiting delayed biomass production and drastically reduced cephalosporin C synthesis. Furthermore, both single- and double-deletion strains are more sensitive to oxidative stress and form fewer arthrospores. Our findings provide evidence that autotrophic sulfur assimilation is essential for growth and cephalosporin C biosynthesis in production strain A3/2 from Acr. chrysogenum.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are important molecules produced during the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. Hcy metabolism is central to the supply of methyl groups that are essential for biological function. Hcy can be either regenerated to methionine or metabolized to cysteine, a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) play a crucial role in metabolizing Hcy to cysteine through the transsulfuration pathway. These two enzymes are also responsible for H2S generation through desulfuration reactions. H2S, at physiological levels serves as a gaseous mediator and has multifaceted effects. Metabolic imbalance of Hcy and H2S has been implicated in pathological conditions including oxidative stress, inflammation, cardiovascular and cerebral dysfunction, fatty liver disease and ischemiareperfusion injury. Organs such as liver, kidney, gut and pancreas contain all the enzymes that are required for Hcy metabolism. The kidney plays an important role in removing Hcy from the circulation. Hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition of elevated blood Hcy level, is a common clinical finding in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI), the latter is often caused by ischemia-reperfusion. This paper reviews exiting literatures regarding (1) the role of kidney in regulating Hcy and H2S metabolism; (2) disruption of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism during ischemiareperfusion; (3) impact of metabolic imbalance of Hcy and H2S on kidney function. Better understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate Hcy and H2S metabolism under physiological and pathophysiological conditions will help improve therapeutic strategies for patients with kidney disease or other organ injuries.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: In sepsis increasing plasma lactate, even if unrelated to hypoperfusion and hypoxia, is a cause of concern. Among the patterns associated with increasing lactate, several plasma amino acid (AA) abnormalities, more in particular those of sulfur AAs, have remained unexplored, and their assessment has been the purpose of our study.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic and detailed analysis of 183 simultaneous determinations of plasma AA-grams and lactate, from 12 trauma surgery patients who had developed sepsis, was performed. Sepsis severity ranged from moderate to extreme illness. Correlations between changes in lactate and in AA levels were assessed by regression analysis.RESULTS: Increasing lactate was related to increasing alanine, proline, asparagine, tyrosine, cystathionine, histidine, glutamine, citrulline, methionine, phenylalanine and hydroxyproline (r from 0.62 to 0.36, p &lt; 0.001 for all) and to decreasing taurine (r = -0.62, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, increasing lactate was strongly related to increasing cystathionine/taurine ratio (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.001). These correlations were independent of the simultaneous relationship found between increasing lactate and decreasing mixed venous O2 tension.CONCLUSIONS: The overall findings and the correlation with the cystathionine/taurine ratio support the hypothesis that increasing lactate in sepsis may be paralleled by impaired hepatic AA transsulfuration. Because this may disable antioxidant protection by limiting glutathione and taurine availability, the metabolic perturbations associated with septic hyperlactatemia may include enhanced exposure to oxidative stress.</p>

<p>S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the methyl donor for biological methylation modifications that regulate protein and nucleic acid functions. Here, we show that methylation of a phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), is a major consumer of SAM. The induction of phospholipid biosynthetic genes is accompanied by induction of the enzyme that hydrolyzes S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a product and inhibitor of methyltransferases. Beyond its function for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the methylation of PE facilitates the turnover of SAM for the synthesis of cysteine and glutathione through transsulfuration. Strikingly, cells that lack PE methylation accumulate SAM, which leads to hypermethylation of histones and the major phosphatase PP2A, dependency on cysteine, and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Without PE methylation, particular sites on histones then become methyl sinks to enable the conversion of SAM to SAH. These findings reveal an unforeseen metabolic function for phospholipid and histone methylation intrinsic to the life of a cell.</p>

<p>Vitamin B6 (B6) has a central role in the metabolism of amino acids, which includes important interactions with endogenous redox reactions through its effects on the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) system. In fact, B6-dependent enzymes catalyse most reactions of the transsulfuration pathway, driving homocysteine to cysteine and further into GPX proteins. Considering that mammals metabolize sulfur- and seleno-amino acids similarly, B6 plays an important role in the fate of sulfur-homocysteine and its seleno counterpart between transsulfuration and one-carbon metabolism, especially under oxidative stress conditions. This is particularly important in reproduction because ovarian metabolism may generate an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the peri-estrus period, which may impair ovulatory functions and early embryo development. Later in gestation, placentation raises embryo oxygen tension and may induce a higher expression of ROS markers and eventually embryo losses. Interestingly, the metabolic accumulation of ROS up-regulates the flow of one-carbon units to transsulfuration and down-regulates remethylation. However, in embryos, the transsulfuration pathway is not functional, making the understanding of the interplay between these two pathways particularly crucial. In this review, the importance of the maternal metabolic status of B6 for the flow of one-carbon units towards both maternal and embryonic GPX systems is discussed. Additionally, B6 effects on GPX activity and gene expression in dams, as well as embryo development, are presented in a pig model under different oxidative stress conditions.</p>

<p>An important mechanism of nutritional “programming” induced by supplementation with methyl donors during pregnancy is the alteration of mRNA abundance in the offspring. We investigated the effects of rumen-protected Met (RPM) on abundance of 17 genes in the 1-carbon, Met, and transsulfuration pathways in calf liver from cows fed the same basal diet without (control, CON) or with RPM at 0.08% of diet dry matter/d (MET) from -21 through +30 d around calving. Biopsies (n = 8 calves per diet) were harvested on d 4, 14, 28, and 50 of age. Cows fed RPM had greater plasma concentration of Met (17.8 vs. 28.2 µM) at -10 d from calving. However, no difference was present in colostrum yield and free AA concentrations. Greater abundance on d 4 and 14 of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2), adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY; also known as SAHH), and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) in MET calves indicated alterations in Met, choline, and homocysteine metabolism. Those data agree with the greater abundance of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) in MET calves. Along with CBS, the greater abundance of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC) and glutathione reductase (GSR) on d 4 in MET calves indicated a short-term postnatal alteration in the use of homocysteine for taurine and glutathione synthesis (both are potent intracellular antioxidants). The striking 7-fold upregulation at d 50 versus 4 of cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), catalyzing the last step of taurine synthesis, in MET and CON calves underscores an important role of taurine during postnatal calf growth. The unique role of taurine in the young calf is further supported by the upregulation of CBS, GCLC, and GSR at d 50 versus 14 and 28 in MET and CON. Although betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) activity did not differ in MET and CON, it increased ~50% at d 14 and 28 versus 4. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.79) was present between BHMT abundance and BHMT activity regardless of treatment. The gradual upregulation over time of BHMT2 and SAHH coupled with the gradual upregulation of MAT1A and the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) in MET and CON calves was indicative of adaptations potentially driven by differences in intake of milk replacer and starter feed as calves grew. In that context, the ~2.5-fold increase in abundance of DNMT3B at d 50 versus 4 in MET and CON indicate that DNA methylation might be an important component of the physiologic adaptations of calf liver. The data indicate that calves from MET-supplemented cows underwent alterations in Met, choline, and homocysteine metabolism partly to synthesize taurine and glutathione, which would be advantageous for controlling metabolic-related stress. Whether the effects in MET calves were directly related to increased Met supply in utero remains to be determined.</p>

<p>Cystine, an oxidized form of cysteine (Cys), is imported into cells via the protein xCT, which is also associated with the export of glutamate as the counter amino acid. In the current study, we attempted to rationalize roles of xCT in the livers of male mice. While xCT was not expressed in the livers of ordinary mice, it was induced under conditions of glutathione depletion, caused by the administration of acetaminophen (AAP). To differentiate the role between xCT and the transsulfuration pathway on the supply of Cys, we employed an inhibitor of the enzyme cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, propargylglycine (PPG). This inhibitor caused a marked aggravation in AAP-induced hepatic damage and the mortality of the xCT<sup>-/-</sup> mice was increased to a greater extent than that for the xCT<sup>+/+</sup> mice. While a PPG pretreatment had no effect on liver condition or Cys levels, the administration of AAP to the PPG-pretreated mice reduced the levels of Cys as well as glutathione to very low levels in both the xCT<sup>+/+</sup> and xCT<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These findings indicate that the transsulfuration pathway plays a major role in replenishing Cys when glutathione levels are low. Moreover, an ascorbic acid insufficiency, induced by Akr1a ablation, further aggravated the AAP-induced liver damage in the case of the xCT deficiency, indicating that glutathione and ascorbic acid function cooperatively in protecting the liver. In conclusion, while the transsulfuration pathway plays a primary role in supplying Cys to the redox system in the liver, xCT is induced in cases of emergencies, by compensating for Cys supply systems.</p>

<p>Lanthionine is a nonproteinogenic amino acid, composed of two alanine residues that are crosslinked on their ß-carbon atoms by a thioether linkage. It is biosynthesized from the condensation of two cysteine molecules, while the related compound homolanthionine is formed from the condensation of two homocysteine molecules. The reactions can be carried out by either cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) independently, in the alternate reactions of the transsulfuration pathway devoted to hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis. Low plasma total hydrogen sulfide levels, probably due to reduced CSE expression, are present in uremia, while homolanthionine and lanthionine accumulate in blood, the latter several fold. Uremic patients display a derangement of sulfur amino acid metabolism with a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia. Uremia is associated with a high cardiovascular mortality, the causes of which are still not completely explained, but are related to uremic toxicity, due to the accumulation of retention products. Lanthionine inhibits hydrogen sulfide production in hepatoma cells, possibly through CBS inhibition, thus providing some basis for the biochemical mechanism, which may significantly contribute to alterations of metabolism sulfur compounds in these subjects (e.g., high homocysteine and low hydrogen sulfide). We therefore suggest that lanthionine is a novel uremic toxin.</p>

<p>Previous research has shown a connection between metabolic abnormalities in the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway and autism spectrum disorder. Using clinical data from a case-control study investigating measurements of transmethylation and transsulfuration metabolites, a steady-state model of these metabolites in liver cells was developed and participant-specific parameters were identified. Comparison of mean parameter values and parameter distributions between neurotypical study participants and those on the autism spectrum revealed significant differences for four model parameters. Sensitivity analysis identified the parameter describing the rate of glutamylcysteine synthesis, the rate-limiting step in glutathione production, to be particularly important in determining steady-state metabolite concentrations. These results may provide insight into key reactions to target for potential intervention strategies relating to autism spectrum disorder.</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to profile plasma amino acids (AA) and derivatives of their metabolism during the periparturient period in response to supplemental rumen-protected methionine (MET) or rumen-protected choline (CHOL). Forty cows were fed from -21 through 30 days around parturition in a 2 × 2 factorial design a diet containing MET or CHOL. MET supply led to greater circulating methionine and proportion of methionine in the essential AA pool, total AA, and total sulfur-containing compounds. Lysine in total AA also was greater in these cows, indicating a better overall AA profile. Sulfur-containing compounds (cystathionine, cystine, homocystine, and taurine) were greater in MET-fed cows, indicating an enriched sulfur-containing compound pool due to enhanced transsulfuration activity. Circulating essential AA and total AA concentrations were greater in cows supplied MET due to greater lysine, arginine, tryptophan, threonine, proline, asparagine, alanine, and citrulline. In contrast, CHOL supply had no effect on essential AA or total AA, and only tryptophan and cystine were greater. Plasma 3-methylhistidine concentration was lower in response to CHOL supply, suggesting less tissue protein mobilization in these cows. Overall, the data revealed that enhanced periparturient supply of MET has positive effects on plasma AA profiles and overall antioxidant status.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a toxic, sulfur-containing intermediate of methionine metabolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcy), as a consequence of impaired Hcy metabolism or defects in crucial co-factors that participate in its recycling, is assumed as an independent human stroke risk factor. Neural cells are sensitive to prolonged hHcy treatment, because Hcy cannot be metabolized either by the transsulfuration pathway or by the folate/vitamin B12 independent remethylation pathway. Its detrimental effect after ischemia-induced damage includes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and posttranslational modifications of proteins via homocysteinylation and thiolation. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is an adaptive response of the CNS to sub-lethal ischemia, which elevates tissues tolerance to subsequent ischemia. The main focus of this review is on the recent data on homocysteine metabolism and mechanisms of its neurotoxicity. In this context, the review documents an increased oxidative stress and functional modification of enzymes involved in redox balance in experimentally induced hyperhomocysteinemia. It also gives an interpretation whether hyperhomocysteinemia alone or in combination with IPC affects the ischemia-induced neurodegenerative changes as well as intracellular signaling. Studies document that hHcy alone significantly increased Fluoro-Jade C- and TUNEL-positive cell neurodegeneration in the rat hippocampus as well as in the cortex. IPC, even if combined with hHcy, could still preserve the neuronal tissue from the lethal ischemic effects. This review also describes the changes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein pathways following ischemic injury and IPC. These studies provide evidence for the interplay and tight integration between ERK and p38 MAPK signaling mechanisms in response to the hHcy and also in association of hHcy with ischemia/IPC challenge in the rat brain. Further investigations of the protective factors leading to ischemic tolerance and recognition of the co-morbid risk factors would result in development of new avenues for exploration of novel therapeutics against ischemia and stroke.</p>

<p>Ischemia-reperfusion is a common cause for acute kidney injury and can lead to distant organ dysfunction. Glutathione is a major endogenous antioxidant and its depletion directly correlates to ischemia-reperfusion injury. The liver has high capacity for producing glutathione and is a key organ in modulating local and systemic redox balance. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which kidney ischemia-reperfusion led to glutathione depletion and oxidative stress. The left kidney of Sprague-Dawley rats was subjected to 45<U+2009>min ischemia followed by 6<U+2009>h reperfusion. Ischemia-reperfusion impaired kidney and liver function. This was accompanied by a decrease in glutathione levels in the liver and plasma and increased hepatic lipid peroxidation and plasma homocysteine levels. Ischemia-reperfusion caused a significant decrease in mRNA and protein levels of hepatic glutamate-cysteine ligase mediated through the inhibition of transcription factor Nrf2. Ischemia-reperfusion inhibited hepatic expression of cystathionine <i><U+03B3></i>-lyase, an enzyme responsible for producing cysteine (an essential precursor for glutathione synthesis) through the transsulfuration pathway. These results suggest that inhibition of glutamate-cysteine ligase expression and downregulation of the transsulfuration pathway lead to reduced hepatic glutathione biosynthesis and elevation of plasma homocysteine levels, which, in turn, may contribute to oxidative stress and distant organ injury during renal ischemia-reperfusion.</p>

<p>Low-level formaldehyde exposure is inevitable in industrialized countries. Although daily-life formaldehyde exposure level is practically impossible to induce cell death, most of mechanistic studies related to formaldehyde toxicity have been performed in cytotoxic concentrations enough to trigger cell death mechanism. Currently, toxicological mechanisms underlying the sub-cytotoxic exposure to formaldehyde are not clearly elucidated in skin cells. In this study, the genome-scale transcriptional analysis in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) was performed to investigate cutaneous biological pathways associated with daily life formaldehyde exposure. We selected the 175 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 116 downregulated DEGs in NHKs treated with 200µM formaldehyde. In the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the 175 upregulated DEGs, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) was identified as the most significant GO biological process in the formaldeyde-treated NHKs. Interestingly, the sub-cytotoxic formaldehyde affected NHKs to upregulate two enzymes important in the cellular transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS). In the temporal expression analysis, the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory DEGs such as MMP1 and PTGS2 was detected earlier than that of CTH, CBS and other ER UPR genes. The metabolites of CTH and CBS, l-cystathionine and l-cysteine, attenuated the formaldehyde-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory DEGs, MMP1, PTGS2, and CXCL8, suggesting that CTH and CBS play a role in the negative feedback regulation of formaldehyde-induced pro-inflammatory responses in NHKs. In this regard, the sub-cytotoxic formaldehyde-induced CBS and CTH may regulate inflammation fate decision to resolution by suppressing the early pro-inflammatory response.</p>

<p>Elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine have been well established as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases, yet the etiologic relationship of homocysteine to these disorders remains poorly understood. Protein N-homocysteinylation has been hypothesized as a contributing factor; however, it has not been examined globally owing to the lack of suitable detection methods. We recently developed a selective chemical method to label N-homocysteinylated proteins with a biotin-aldehyde tag followed by Western blotting analysis, which was further optimized in this study. We then investigated the variation of protein N-homocysteinylation in plasma from rats on a vitamin B12 deficient diet. Elevated “total homocysteine” concentrations were determined in rats with a vitamin B12 deficient diet. Correspondingly, overall levels of plasma protein N-homocysteinylation displayed an increased trend, and furthermore, more pronounced and statistically significant changes (e.g., 1.8-fold, p-value: 0.03) were observed for some individual protein bands. Our results suggest that, as expected, a general metabolic correlation exists between “total homocysteine” and N-homocysteinylation, although other factors are involved in homocysteine/homocysteine thiolactone metabolism, such as the transsulfuration of homocysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase or the hydrolysis of homocysteine thiolactone by paraoxonase 1 (PON1), may play more significant or direct roles in determining the level of N-homocysteinylation.</p>

<p>The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), serves as a co-factor in more than 150 enzymatic reactions. Plasma PLP has consistently been shown to be low in inflammatory conditions; there is a parallel reduction in liver PLP, but minor changes in erythrocyte and muscle PLP and in functional vitamin B6 biomarkers. Plasma PLP also predicts the risk of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and some cancers, and is inversely associated with numerous inflammatory markers in clinical and population-based studies. Vitamin B6 intake and supplementation improve some immune functions in vitamin B6-deficient humans and experimental animals. A possible mechanism involved is mobilization of vitamin B6 to the sites of inflammation where it may serve as a co-factor in pathways producing metabolites with immunomodulating effects. Relevant vitamin B6-dependent inflammatory pathways include vitamin B6 catabolism, the kynurenine pathway, sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway, and serine and glycine metabolism.</p>

<p>Cirrhosis is a end-stage disease of the liver in which fibrogenesis, angiogenesis and distortion of intrahepatic microcirculation lead to increased intrahepatic resistance to portal blood flow, a condition known as portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is maintained by a variety of molecular mechanisms including sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) hyporeactivity, activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), reduction in hepatic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity along with increased eNOS-derived NO generation in the splanchnic and systemic circulations. A reduction of the expression/function of the two major hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), has also been demonstrated. A deficit in the transsulfuration pathway leading to the accumulation of homocysteine might contribute to defective generation of H2S and endothelial hyporeactivity. Bile acids are ligands for nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the G-protein bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1). FXR and GPBAR1 ligands regulate the expression/activity of CSE by both genomic and non-genomic effects and have been proved effective in protecting against endothelial dysfunction observed in rodent models of cirrhosis. GPBAR1, a receptor for secondary bile acids, is selectively expressed by LSECs and its activation increases the expression of CSE and attenuates the production of endotelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor agent. In vivo GPBAR1 ligand attenuates the imbalance between vasodilatory and vaso-constricting agents, making GPBAR1 a promising target in the treatment of portal hypertension.</p>

<p>Sediment contamination can pose risks to the environment, and sediment toxicity tests have been developed to isolate the impact of sediment from other factors. Mixtures of contaminants often occur in sediments, and traditional endpoints used in toxicity testing, such as growth, reproduction, and survival, cannot discern the cause of toxicity from chemical mixtures because of complex interactions. In urban waterways, the synthetic pyrethroid bifenthrin and the metal copper are commonly found in mixtures, so the present study was designed to investigate how these contaminants cause toxicity in mixtures. To investigate this, Chironomus tepperi was exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of copper and bifenthrin-spiked sediments in a 2-way factorial mixture for 5<U+2009>d. Growth and expression profiles of cysteine metabolism genes were measured after exposure. Growth increased at low copper concentrations, decreased at high copper concentrations, and was unaffected by bifenthrin exposures. Copper exposures induced possible cellular repair by upregulating S-adenosylmethionine synthetase expression and downregulating expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and cystathionine-ß-synthase. Metallothionein upregulation was also observed. Bifenthrin exposure altered cysteine metabolism to a lesser extent, downregulating cystathionine-ß-synthase and <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthase. Synergistic, antagonistic, and dose-dependent interactions were observed, and there was evidence of conflicting modes of action and limited substrate production. These findings demonstrate how contextual gene expression changes can be sensitive and specific identifiers of toxicant exposure in mixtures. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:691-698. © 2016 SETAC.</p>

<p>Although hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), there is a debate on whether HHcy is a risk factor or just a biomarker. Interestingly, homocysteine lowering strategies in humans had very little effect on reducing the cardiovascular risk, as compared with animals; this may suggest heterogeneity in human population and epigenetic alterations. Moreover, there are only few studies that suggest the idea that HHcy contributes to CVD in the presence of other risk factors such as inflammation, a known risk factor for CVD. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been shown to contribute to inflammation. Here, we highlight possible relationships between homocysteine, T cell immunity, and hypertension, and summarize the evidence that suggested these factors act together in increasing the risk for CVD. In light of this new evidence, we further propose that there is a need for evaluation of the causes of HHcy, defective remethylation or defective transsulfuration, which may differentially modulate hypertension progression, not just the homocysteine levels.</p>

<p>Substrate ambiguity and relaxed reaction specificity underlie the diversity of reactions catalyzed by the transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and <U+03B3>-cystathionase (CSE). These enzymes either commit sulfur metabolism to cysteine synthesis from homocysteine or utilize cysteine and/or homocysteine for synthesis of H2S, a signaling molecule. We demonstrate that a kinetically controlled heme-dependent metabolite switch in CBS regulates these competing reactions where by cystathionine, the product of CBS, inhibits H2S synthesis by the second enzyme, CSE. Under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, induction of CSE and up-regulation of the CBS inhibitor, CO, a product of heme oxygenase-1, flip the operating preference of CSE from cystathionine to cysteine, transiently stimulating H2S production. In contrast, genetic deficiency of CBS leads to chronic stimulation of H2S production. This metabolite switch from cystathionine to cysteine and/or homocysteine renders H2S synthesis by CSE responsive to the known modulators of CBS: S-adenosylmethionine, NO, and CO. Used acutely, it regulates H2S synthesis; used chronically, it might contribute to disease pathology.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a spectrum of human disorders, ranging from rare, inborn errors of metabolism to common, age-associated diseases such as neurodegeneration. How these lesions give rise to diverse pathology is not well understood, partly because their proximal consequences have not been well-studied in mammalian cells. Here we provide two lines of evidence that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction leads to alterations in one-carbon metabolism pathways. First, using hypothesis-generating metabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional profiling, followed by confirmatory experiments, we report that mitochondrial DNA depletion leads to an ATF4-mediated increase in serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. Second, we show that lesioning the respiratory chain impairs mitochondrial production of formate from serine, and that in some cells, respiratory chain inhibition leads to growth defects upon serine withdrawal that are rescuable with purine or formate supplementation. Our work underscores the connection between the respiratory chain and one-carbon metabolism with implications for understanding mitochondrial pathogenesis.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate changes in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and redox balance in response to exercise treatment in a tumor-bearing rat model.METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed, or not, to a resistance exercise program 6 wk before inoculation with Walker-256 tumor cells or vehicle. After application, rats maintained their routine for 12 d and were then sacrificed for plasma and liver analyses.RESULTS: Impaired Hcy metabolism was evident after 12 d of tumor cell inoculation as demonstrated by significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration (53%) and decreased plasma cysteine, methionine, and vitamin B12 concentrations. Decreased hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase mRNA levels were found in tumor-bearing rats but not in controls. Tumor inoculation also decreased levels of liver reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased hepatic oxidative stress compared with non-tumor controls. However, resistance exercise prevented the tumor-impaired transsulfuration pathway as demonstrated by the decreased plasma tHcy, hepatic CBS expression, and increased GSH in tumor-exercised versus tumor-sedentary rats. Remarkably, all measures of liver oxidative stress were suppressed by exercise training. Tumor weight was unchanged between groups.CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise prevented tHcy accumulation and liver oxidative damage caused by Walker-256 tumor cell inoculation; the modulatory effects of resistance exercise on Hcy metabolism appear to be at the level of transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>Aldehyde reductase (AKR1A) plays a role in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (AsA), and AKR1A-deficient mice produce about 10-15% of the AsA that is produced by wild-type mice. We found that acetaminophen (AAP) hepatotoxicity was aggravated in AKR1A-deficient mice. The pre-administration of AsA in the drinking water markedly ameliorated the AAP hepatotoxicity in the AKR1A-deficient mice. Treatment of the mice with AAP decreased both glutathione and AsA levels in the liver in the early phase after AAP administration, and an AsA deficiency delayed the recovery of the glutathione content in the healing phase. While in cysteine supply systems; a neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1, a cystine transporter xCT, enzymes for the transsulfuration pathway, and autophagy markers, were all elevated in the liver as the result of the AAP treatment, the AsA deficiency suppressed their induction. Thus, AsA appeared to exert a protective effect against AAP hepatotoxicity by ameliorating the supply of cysteine that is available for glutathione synthesis as a whole. Because some drugs produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in the consumption of glutathione during the metabolic process, the intake of sufficient amounts of AsA would be beneficial for protecting against the hepatic damage caused by such drugs.</p>

<p>One carbon metabolism or methyl transfer, a crucial component of metabolism in all cells and tissues, supports the critical function of synthesis of purines, thymidylate and methylation via multiple methyl transferases driven by the ubiquitous methyl donor s-adenosylmethionine. Serine is the primary methyl donor to the one carbon pool. Intracellular folates and methionine metabolism are the critical components of one carbon transfer. Methionine metabolism requires vitamin B12, B6 as cofactors and is modulated by endocrine signals and is responsive to nutrient intake. Perturbations in one carbon transfer can have profound effects on cell proliferation, growth and function. Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental model have established a strong relationship between impaired fetal growth and the immediate and long term consequences to the health of the offspring. It is speculated that during development, maternal environmental and nutrient influences by their effects on one carbon transfer can impact the health of the mother, impair growth and reprogram metabolism of the fetus, and cause long term morbidity in the offspring. The potential for such effects is underscored by the unique responses in methionine metabolism in the human mother during pregnancy, the absence of transsulfuration activity in the fetus, ontogeny of methionine metabolism in the placenta and the unique metabolism of serine and glycine in the fetus. Dietary protein restriction in animals and marginal protein intake in humans causes characteristic changes in one carbon metabolism. The impact of perturbations in one carbon metabolism on the health of the mother during pregnancy, on fetal growth and the neonate are discussed and their possible mechanism explored.</p>

<p>At the SSIEM Symposium in Istanbul 2010, I presented an overview of protein structural approaches in the study of inborn errors of metabolism (Yue and Oppermann 2011). Five years on, the field is going strong with new protein structures, uncovered catalytic functions and novel chemical matters for metabolic enzymes, setting the stage for the next generation of drug discovery. This article aims to update on recent advances and lessons learnt on inborn errors of metabolism via the protein-centric approach, citing examples of work from my group, collaborators and co-workers that cover diverse pathways of transsulfuration, cobalamin and glycogen metabolism. Taking into consideration that many inborn errors of metabolism result in the loss of enzyme function, this presentation aims to outline three key principles that guide the design of small molecule therapy in this technically challenging field: (1) integrating structural, biochemical and cell-based data to evaluate the wide spectrum of mutation-driven enzyme defects in stability, catalysis and protein-protein interaction; (2) studying multi-domain proteins and multi-protein complexes as examples from nature, to learn how enzymes are activated by small molecules; (3) surveying different regions of the enzyme, away from its active site, that can be targeted for the design of allosteric activators and inhibitors.</p>

<p>Methionine is an essential amino acid which when not incorporated into protein, can be converted to S-adenosylmethionine, the universal methyl donor in over 200 transmethylation reactions, which include creatine and phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, as well as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation. Following transmethylation, homocysteine is formed, which can be converted to cysteine via transsulfuration or remethylated to methionine by receiving a methyl group from folate or betaine. Changes to methyl group availability in utero can lead to permanent changes in epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation, which has been implicated in “fetal programming”, a phenomenon associated with poor nutrition during fetal development that results in low birth weight and disease in later life. It has been shown that programming can also occur in the neonate. Our global objective was to understand how the variability of nutrients involved in methionine metabolism can affect methionine and methyl group availability. We hypothesize that nutrients that converge on methionine metabolism can affect methionine availability for its various functions. In this thesis, we used intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) piglets to investigate whether a global nutritional insult in utero can lead to a perturbed methionine metabolism. Our results demonstrate that IUGR piglets have a lower capacity to dispose of homocysteine via both transsulfuration and remethylation pathways, as well as a lower incorporation of methyl groups into PC. The second objective of this thesis was to determine whether variation in methionine supply and demand can affect methionine availability. We demonstrated that stimulating either acute or chronic creatine synthesis leads to lower methyl incorporation into protein and PC in pigs. Furthermore, when methionine is limiting, supplementation with either folate or betaine leads to higher methionine availability for protein synthesis. Finally, because creatine is increasingly being utilized as an ergogenic and neuroprotective supplement, we wanted to determine whether provision of the creatine precursor, guanidinoacetate (GAA), could effectively increase tissue creatine stores. We showed that 2.5 weeks of supplementation with GAA is more effective than creatine at increasing hepatic and muscle creatine stores. The results of this thesis demonstrate that the presence of IUGR, an increased demand for creatine synthesis, or the supplementation with remethylation nutrients can each affect methionine availability; all are important when considering neonatal nutrient requirements. Furthermore, although GAA is effective at increasing levels of tissue creatine, higher GAA methylation can limit methionine availability for growth and synthesis of PC.</p>

<p>Methionine is an essential proteinogenic amino acid that is obtained from the diet. In addition to its requirement for protein biosynthesis, methionine is metabolized to generate metabolites that play key roles in a number of cellular functions. Metabolism of methionine via the transmethylation pathway generates S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that serves as the principal methyl (-CH3) donor for DNA and histone methyltransferases (MTs) to regulate epigenetic changes in gene expression. SAM is also required for methylation of other cellular proteins that serve various functions and phosphatidylcholine synthesis that participate in cellular signaling. Under conditions of oxidative stress, homocysteine (which is derived from SAM) enters the transsulfuration pathway to generate glutathione, an important cytoprotective molecule against oxidative damage. As both experimental and clinical studies have shown that traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters DNA and histone methylation and causes oxidative stress, we examined if TBI alters the plasma levels of methionine and its metabolites in human patients. Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (HV; n = 20) and patients with mild TBI (mTBI; GCS &gt; 12; n = 20) or severe TBI (sTBI; GCS &lt; 8; n = 20) within the first 24 h of injury. The levels of methionine and its metabolites in the plasma samples were analyzed by either liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS or GC-MS). sTBI decreased the levels of methionine, SAM, betaine and 2-methylglycine as compared to HV, indicating a decrease in metabolism through the transmethylation cycle. In addition, precursors for the generation of glutathione, cysteine and glycine were also found to be decreased as were intermediate metabolites of the gamma-glutamyl cycle (gamma-glutamyl amino acids and 5-oxoproline). mTBI also decreased the levels of methionine, a-ketobutyrate, 2 hydroxybutyrate and glycine, albeit to lesser degrees than detected in the sTBI group. Taken together, these results suggest that decreased levels of methionine and its metabolic products are likely to alter cellular function in multiple organs at a systems level.</p>

<p>The metabolic demand for methionine is great in neonates. Indeed, methionine is the only indispensable sulfur amino acid and is required not only for protein synthesis and growth but is also partitioned to a greater extent to transsulfuration for cysteine and taurine synthesis and to &gt;50 transmethylation reactions that serve to methylate DNA and synthesize metabolites, including creatine and phosphatidylcholine. Therefore, the pediatric methionine requirement must accommodate the demands of rapid protein turnover as well as vast nonprotein demands. Because cysteine spares the methionine requirement, it is likely that the dietary provision of transmethylation products can also feasibly spare methionine. However, understanding the requirement of methionine is further complicated because demethylated methionine can be remethylated by the dietary methyl donors folate and betaine (derived from choline). Intakes of dietary methyl donors are highly variable, which is of particular concern for newborns. It has been demonstrated that many populations have enhanced requirements for these nutrients, and nutrient fortification may exacerbate this phenomenon by selecting phenotypes that increase methyl requirements. Moreover, higher transmethylation rates can limit methyl supply and affect other transmethylation reactions as well as protein synthesis. Therefore, careful investigations are needed to determine how remethylation and transmethylation contribute to the methionine requirement. The purpose of this review is to support our hypothesis that dietary methyl donors and consumers can drive methionine availability for protein synthesis and transmethylation reactions. We argue that nutritional strategies in neonates need to ensure that methionine is available to meet requirements for growth as well as for transmethylation products.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The majority of cancer cells have a unique metabolic requirement for methionine that is not observed in normal, non-tumorigenic cells. This phenotype is described as “methionine dependence” or “methionine stress sensitivity” in which cancer cells are unable to proliferate when methionine has been replaced with its metabolic precursor, homocysteine, in cell culture growth media. We focus on the metabolic response to methionine stress in the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and its methionine insensitive derivative cell line MDA-MB-468res-R8.RESULTS: Using a variety of techniques including fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and extracellular flux assays, we identified a metabolic down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in both MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-468res-R8 cell types when cultured in homocysteine media. Untargeted metabolomics was performed by way of gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry on both cell types cultured in homocysteine media over a period of 2 to 24 h. We determined unique metabolic responses between the two cell lines in specific pathways including methionine salvage, purine/pyrimidine synthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Stable isotope tracer studies using deuterium-labeled homocysteine indicated a redirection of homocysteine metabolism toward the transsulfuration pathway and glutathione synthesis. This data corroborates with increased glutathione levels concomitant with increased levels of oxidized glutathione. Redirection of homocysteine flux resulted in reduced generation of methionine from homocysteine particularly in MDA-MB-468 cells. Consequently, synthesis of the important one-carbon donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was decreased, perturbing the SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio in MDA-MB-468 cells, which is an indicator of the cellular methylation potential.CONCLUSION: This study indicates a differential metabolic response between the methionine sensitive MDA-MB-468 cells and the methionine insensitive derivative cell line MDA-MB-468res-R8. Both cell lines appear to experience oxidative stress when methionine was replaced with its metabolic precursor homocysteine, forcing cells to redirect homocysteine metabolism toward the transsulfuration pathway to increase glutathione synthesis. The methionine stress resistant MDA-MB-468res-R8 cells responded to this cellular stress earlier than the methionine stress sensitive MDA-MB468 cells and coped better with metabolic demands. Additionally, it is evident that S-adenosylmethionine metabolism is dependent on methionine availability in cancer cells, which cannot be sufficiently supplied by homocysteine metabolism under these conditions.</p>

<p>The most common cause of isolated inherited homocysteinemia is a deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Clinical manifestations of CBS deficiency can include ectopia lentis, thromboembolism, marfanoid habits, and intellectual disability. CBS deficiency, which affects the transsulfuration pathway, is marked biochemically by elevated serum homocysteine and plasma methionine. We report a patient with homocysteinemia, low plasma methionine, and no significant neurological abnormalities who presented with bilateral subluxated crystalline lenses due to a 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency. MTHFR deficiency, a disorder in the remethylation pathway, can cause mild to severe disease, although most presentations include neurological involvement. MTHFR deficiency has not been previously associated with lens subluxation or complete dislocation. Prolonged exposure to elevated serum homocysteine levels is most likely the explanation for her ectopia lentis. This case expands the differential diagnosis of homocysteinemia and highlights the need for a correct diagnosis to optimize the clinical outcome of patients with this condition.</p>

<p>Methionine is an essential sulfur amino acid that is engaged in key cellular functions such as protein synthesis and is a precursor for critical metabolites involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In mammals, in response to nutrient conditions, the liver plays a significant role in regulating methionine concentrations by altering its flux through the transmethylation, transsulfuration, and transamination metabolic pathways. A comprehensive understanding of how hepatic methionine metabolism intersects with other regulatory nutrient signaling and transcriptional events is, however, lacking. Here, we show that methionine and derived-sulfur metabolites in the transamination pathway activate the GCN5 acetyltransferase promoting acetylation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1a to control hepatic gluconeogenesis. Methionine was the only essential amino acid that rapidly induced PGC-1a acetylation through activating the GCN5 acetyltransferase. Experiments employing metabolic pathway intermediates revealed that methionine transamination, and not the transmethylation or transsulfuration pathways, contributed to methionine-induced PGC-1a acetylation. Moreover, aminooxyacetic acid, a transaminase inhibitor, was able to potently suppress PGC-1a acetylation stimulated by methionine, which was accompanied by predicted alterations in PGC-1a-mediated gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production in primary murine hepatocytes. Methionine administration in mice likewise induced hepatic PGC-1a acetylation, suppressed the gluconeogenic gene program, and lowered glycemia, indicating that a similar phenomenon occurs in vivo These results highlight a communication between methionine metabolism and PGC-1a-mediated hepatic gluconeogenesis, suggesting that influencing methionine metabolic flux has the potential to be therapeutically exploited for diabetes treatment.</p>

<p>Methionine restriction is a widely reported intervention for increasing life span in several model organisms. Low circulating levels of methionine are evident in the long-lived naked mole-rat, suggesting that it naturally presents with a life-extending phenotype akin to that observed in methionine-restricted animals. Similarly, long-lived dwarf mice also appear to have altered methionine metabolism. The mechanisms underlying methionine-restriction effects on life-span extension, however, remain unknown, as do their potential connections with caloric restriction, another well-established intervention for prolonging life span. Paradoxically, methionine is enriched in proteins expressed in mitochondria and may itself serve an important role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and may thereby contribute to delayed aging. Collectively, we highlight the evidence that modulation of the methionine metabolic network can extend life span-from yeast to humans-and explore the evidence that sulfur amino acids and the concomitant transsulfuration pathway play a privileged role in this regard. However, systematic studies in single organisms (particularly those that exhibit extreme longevity) are still required to distinguish the fundamental principles concerning the role of methionine and other amino acids in regulating life span.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Suboptimal vitamin B-6 status is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, although the mechanism is unknown. The synthesis of the vasodilator hydrogen sulfide occurs through side reactions of the transsulfuration enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, with pyridoxal 5’-phosphate as a coenzyme. Two proposed hydrogen sulfide biomarkers, lanthionine and homolanthionine, are produced concurrently.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hydrogen sulfide production is reduced by vitamin B-6 deficiency, we examined the relations between plasma concentrations of lanthionine and homolanthionine, along with other components of the transsulfuration pathway (homocysteine, cystathionine, and Cys), in a secondary analysis of samples from 2 vitamin B-6 restriction studies in healthy men and women.METHODS: Metabolite concentrations were measured in plasma from 23 healthy adults (12 men and 11 women) before and after 28-d controlled dietary vitamin B-6 restriction (0.37 ± 0.04 mg/d). Vitamin B-6 restriction effects on lanthionine and homolanthionine concentrations were assessed. Associations between hydrogen sulfide biomarkers, transsulfuration metabolites, and functional indicators of vitamin B-6 deficiency were analyzed by linear regression.CONCLUSIONS: The resiliency of plasma lanthionine and homolanthionine concentrations after short-term vitamin B-6 restriction suggests a minimal effect of moderate vitamin B-6 deficiency on hydrogen sulfide production. Additional research is needed to better understand the metabolism and disposal of these biomarkers in humans. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00877812.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The transsulfuration pathway may be involved in its pathophysiology, since homocysteine, cystathionine and cysteine are increased in PE. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) is a key-enzyme in the pathway, converting homocysteine into cysteine via cystathionine. Another product of CBS is hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a vasodilatory, proangiogenic and cytoprotective gas that is thought to play a role in placental and vascular function during pregnancy. Since single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect CBS expression and/or function, we studied tag-SNPs in the CBS gene in PE patients.STUDY DESIGN: Controls (n=75), early-onset (n=45), and late-onset PE (n=52) cases were genotyped for six tag-SNPs in the CBS gene; rs12329764, rs2851391, rs234713, rs234706, rs1789953, and rs11203172. Plasma homocysteine, cysteine and cystathionine were determined during pregnancy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early-onset PE, late-onset PE.RESULTS: Women with the minor allele of rs11203172 have a reduced risk for early-onset PE. Compared to women without the minor allele, normotensive pregnant women with the minor allele of rs11203172 and rs234713 have lower cysteine levels. Women with the minor allele of rs1789953 have increased levels of cysteine and cystathionine, compared to women without.CONCLUSION: The CBS tag-SNP rs11203172 is associated with a decreased risk for early-onset PE. Decreased cysteine concentrations in normotensive pregnant women carrying the minor allele of rs11203172, may be due to increased cysteine conversion to H2S by CBS. Higher H2S levels may positively affect placentation and vascular function during pregnancy and decrease their risk for PE.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction affects cellular energy metabolism, but less is known about the consequences for cytoplasmic biosynthetic reactions. We report that mtDNA replication disorders caused by TWINKLE mutations-mitochondrial myopathy (MM) and infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA)-remodel cellular dNTP pools in mice. MM muscle shows tissue-specific induction of the mitochondrial folate cycle, purine metabolism, and imbalanced and increased dNTP pools, consistent with progressive mtDNA mutagenesis. IOSCA-TWINKLE is predicted to hydrolyze dNTPs, consistent with low dNTP pools and mtDNA depletion in the disease. MM muscle also modifies the cytoplasmic one-carbon cycle, transsulfuration, and methylation, as well as increases glucose uptake and its utilization for de novo serine and glutathione biosynthesis. Our evidence indicates that the mitochondrial replication machinery communicates with cytoplasmic dNTP pools and that upregulation of glutathione synthesis through glucose-driven de novo serine biosynthesis contributes to the metabolic stress response. These results are important for disorders with primary or secondary mtDNA instability and offer targets for metabolic therapy.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signalling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. There is increasing evidence that H2S is implicated in aging and lifespan control in the diet-induced longevity models. However, blood sulfide concentration of naturally long-lived species is not known. Here we measured blood sulfide in the long-lived naked mole-rat and five other mammalian species considerably differing in lifespan and found a negative correlation between blood sulfide and maximum longevity residual. In addition, we show that the naked mole-rat cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), an enzyme whose activity in the liver significantly contributes to systemic sulfide levels, has lower activity in the liver and is activated to a higher degree by S-adenosylmethionine compared to other species. These results add complexity to the understanding of the role of H2S in aging and call for detailed research on naked mole-rat transsulfuration.</p>

<p>Two enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine -cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and gamma-cystathionase (CTH)-use cysteine and/or homocysteine to produce the important signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and simultaneously the thioethers lanthionine, cystathionine or homolanthionine. In this study we explored whether impaired flux of substrates for H2S synthesis and/or deficient enzyme activities alter production of hydrogen sulfide in patients with homocystinurias. As an indirect measure of H2S synthesis we determined by LC-MS/MS concentrations of thioethers in plasma samples from 33 patients with different types of homocystinurias, in 8 patient derived fibroblast cell lines, and as reaction products of seven purified mutant CBS enzymes. Since chaperoned recombinant mutant CBS enzymes retained capacity of H2S synthesis in vitro it can be stipulated that deficient CBS activity in vivo may impair H2S production. Indeed, in patients with classical homocystinuria we observed significantly decreased cystathionine and lanthionine concentrations in plasma (46% and 74% of median control levels, respectively) and significantly lower cystathionine in fibroblasts (8% of median control concentrations) indicating that H2S production from cysteine and homocysteine may be also impaired. In contrast, the grossly elevated plasma levels of homolanthionine in CBS deficient patients (32-times elevation compared to median of controls) clearly demonstrates a simultaneous overproduction of H2S from homocysteine by CTH. In the remethylation defects the accumulation of homocysteine and the increased flux of metabolites through the transsulfuration pathway resulted in elevation of cystathionine and homolanthionine (857% and 400% of median control values, respectively) indicating a possibility of an increased biosynthesis of H2S by both CBS and CTH. This study shows clearly disturbed thioether concentrations in homocystinurias, and modeling using these data indicates that H2S synthesis may be increased in these conditions. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to explore the possible implications for pathophysiology of these disorders.</p>

<p>The transsulfuration pathway (TS) acts in sulfur amino acid metabolism by contributing to the regulation of cellular homocysteine, cysteine production, and the generation of H2S for signaling functions. Regulation of TS pathway kinetics involves stimulation of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and oxidants such as H2O2, and by Michaelis-Menten principles whereby substrate concentrations affect reaction rates. Although pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) serves as coenzyme for both CBS and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), CSE exhibits much greater loss of activity than CBS during PLP insufficiency. Thus, cellular and plasma cystathionine concentrations increase in vitamin B6 deficiency mainly due to the bottleneck caused by reduced CSE activity. Because of the increase in cystathionine, the canonical production of cysteine (homocysteine <U+2192> cystathionine <U+2192> cysteine) is largely maintained even during vitamin B6 deficiency. Typical whole body transsulfuration flux in humans is 3-7 µmol/h per kg body weight. The in vivo kinetics of H2S production via side reactions of CBS and CSE in humans are unknown but they have been reported for cultured HepG2 cells. In these studies, cells exhibit a pronounced reduction in H2S production capacity and rates of lanthionine and homolanthionine synthesis in deficiency. In humans, plasma concentrations of lanthionine and homolanthionine exhibit little or no mean change due to 4-wk vitamin B6 restriction, nor do they respond to pyridoxine supplementation of subjects in chronically low-vitamin B6 status. Wide individual variation in responses of the H2S biomarkers to such perturbations of human vitamin B6 status suggests that the resulting modulation of H2S production may have physiological consequences in a subset of people.

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) elicits pleiotropic physiological effects ranging from modulation of cardiovascular to CNS functions. A dominant method for transmission of sulfide-based signals is via posttranslational modification of reactive cysteine thiols to persulfides. However, the source of the persulfide donor and whether its relationship to H2S is as a product or precursor is controversial. The transsulfuration pathway enzymes can synthesize cysteine persulfide (Cys-SSH) from cystine and H2S from cysteine and/or homocysteine. Recently, Cys-SSH was proposed as the primary product of the transsulfuration pathway with H2S representing a decomposition product of Cys-SSH. Our detailed kinetic analyses demonstrate a robust capacity for Cys-SSH production by the human transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase and <U+03B3>-cystathionase (CSE) and for homocysteine persulfide synthesis from homocystine by CSE only. However, in the reducing cytoplasmic milieu where the concentration of reduced thiols is significantly higher than of disulfides, substrate level regulation favors the synthesis of H2S over persulfides. Mathematical modeling at physiologically relevant hepatic substrate concentrations predicts that H2S rather than Cys-SSH is the primary product of the transsulfuration enzymes with CSE being the dominant producer. The half-life of the metastable Cys-SSH product is short and decomposition leads to a mixture of polysulfides (Cys-S-(S)n-S-Cys). These in vitro data, together with the intrinsic reactivity of Cys-SSH for cysteinyl versus sulfur transfer, are consistent with the absence of an observable increase in protein persulfidation in cells in response to exogenous cystine and evidence for the formation of polysulfides under these conditions.</p>

<p>Several shortcomings of current Parkinson’s disease (PD) models limit progress in identification of environmental contributions to disease pathogenesis. The conditionally immortalized cell line LUHMES promises to make human dopaminergic neuronal cultures more easily available, but these cells are difficult to culture for extended periods of time. We overcame this problem by culturing them in 3D with minor medium modifications. The 3D neuronal aggregates allowed penetration by small molecules and sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply for survival of the innermost cells. Using confocal microscopy, gene expression, and flow cytometry, we characterized the 3D model and observed a highly reproducible differentiation process. Visualization and quantification of neurites in aggregates was achieved by adding 2 % red fluorescent protein-transfected LUHMES cells. The mitochondrial toxicants and established experimental PD agents, rotenone and MPP<sup>+</sup>, perturbed genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration pathways (ASS1, CTH, and SHTM2) as in 2D cultures. We showed, for the first time in LUHMES, down-regulation of mir-7, a miRNA known to target alpha-synuclein and to be involved in PD. This was observed as early as 12 h after rotenone exposure, when pro-apoptotic mir-16 and rotenone-sensitive mir-210 were not yet significantly perturbed. Finally, washout experiments demonstrated that withdrawal of rotenone led to counter-regulation of mir-7 and ASS1, CTH, and SHTM2 genes. This suggests a possible role of these genes in direct cellular response to the toxicant, and the model appears to be suitable to address the processes of resilience and recovery in neurotoxicology and Parkinson’s disease in future studies.</p>

<p>This study was aimed at investigating the effects of quercetin on mRNA expression and activity of critical enzymes in homocysteine metabolism in rats fed a methionine-enriched diet. Rats were fed for 6 weeks the following diets, that is, control, 0.5% quercetin, 1.0% methionine, and 1.0% methionine plus 0.5% quercetin diets. Serum homocysteine was significantly increased after methionine treatment and decreased after the addition of quercetin. The mRNA expression of methionine synthase was significantly increased after methionine or methionine plus quercetin supplementation, while its enzymatic activity was significantly increased after methionine plus quercetin supplementation. The mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase were upregulated after quercetin, methionine, or quercetin plus methionine treatment and a more significant increase was observed for hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase in the methionine plus quercetin treated rats, suggesting an interaction between methionine and quercetin. Meanwhile, hepatic ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine was significantly decreased in response to methionine supplementation and normalized after the addition of quercetin.

<p>Glutathione is the major intracellular redox buffer in the liver and is critical for hepatic detoxification of xenobiotics and other environmental toxins. Hepatic glutathione is also a major systemic store for other organs and thus impacts on pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease, Sickle Cell Anaemia and chronic diseases associated with aging. Glutathione levels are determined in part by the availability of cysteine, generated from homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway. The partitioning of homocysteine between remethylation and transsulfuration pathways is known to be subject to redox-dependent regulation, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. An association between plasma Hcy and a single nucleotide polymorphism within the NADPH oxidase 4 locus led us to investigate the involvement of this reactive oxygen species- generating enzyme in homocysteine metabolism. Here we demonstrate that NADPH oxidase 4 ablation in mice results in increased flux of homocysteine through the betaine-dependent remethylation pathway to methionine, catalysed by betaine-homocysteine-methyltransferase within the liver. As a consequence NADPH oxidase 4-null mice display significantly lowered plasma homocysteine and the flux of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway is reduced, resulting in lower hepatic cysteine and glutathione levels. Mice deficient in NADPH oxidase 4 had markedly increased susceptibility to acetaminophen-induced hepatic injury which could be corrected by administration of N-acetyl cysteine. We thus conclude that under physiological conditions, NADPH oxidase 4-derived reactive oxygen species is a regulator of the partitioning of the metabolic flux of homocysteine, which impacts upon hepatic cysteine and glutathione levels and thereby upon defence against environmental toxins.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia occurs in chronic- and end-stage kidney disease at the time when dialysis or transplant becomes indispensable for survival. Excessive accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) aggravates conditions associated with imbalanced homeostasis and cellular redox thereby resulting in severe oxidative stress leading to oxidation of reduced free and protein-bound thiols. Thiol modifications such as N-homocysteinylation, sulfination, cysteinylation, glutathionylation, and sulfhydration control cellular responses that direct complex metabolic pathways. Although cysteinyl modifications are kept low, under Hcy-induced stress, thiol modifications persist thus surpassing cellular proteostasis. Here, we review mechanisms of redox regulation and show how cysteinyl modifications triggered by excess Hcy contribute development and progression of chronic kidney disease. We discuss different signaling events resulting from aberrant cysteinyl modification with a focus on transsulfuration.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a nonproteogenic sulfur containing amino acid derived from dietary methionine through demethylation. Homocysteine can be re-methylated to methionine [precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)] via the re-methylation or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pathway or undergoes transsulfuration to form cysteine by the action of metabolic enzymes and cofactors. Impaired metabolism due to genetic alteration in metabolic enzymes (methionine synthase, methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS), and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (C<U+03B3>L) or deficiency in cofactors (vitamin B6 , B12 , folate) may lead to acquired metabolic anomaly known as hyperhomocysteinemia. Hcy excess decreases the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent synthesis of catecholamines, viz. dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and noncatecholamine, viz. serotonin (5-HT), due to genetic alteration in key enzyme MTHFR in the homocysteine metabolism pathway that leads to depression. Thus, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced SAM level is influenced by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MTHFR C677T. Furthermore, HHcy leads to production of precarious neurotoxic product homocysteic acid (HCA) and cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) which acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and has neurotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons. In the current review, an attempt has been made to discuss the neurotoxic effects of HHcy in the pathogenesis of depression.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a derived sulfur-containing and non-proteinogenic amino acid. The metabolism of Hcy occurs either through the remethylation to methionine or transsulfuration to cysteine. Studies have identified hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) as one of the possible risk factors for a multitude of diseases including vascular, neurodegenerative and ocular diseases. Association of HHcy with eye diseases such as retinopathy, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma maculopathy, cataract, optic atrophy and retinal vessel atherosclerosis is established. The molecular mechanism underlying these ocular diseases has been reported as impaired vascular endothelial function, apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells, extracellular matrix alterations, decreased lysyl oxidase activity and oxidative stress. The formed homocysteine-thiolactone in HHcy has stronger cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory properties which can induce lens opacification and optic nerve damage. The metabolism of Hcy requires enzymes with vitamins such as folic acid, vitamins B12 and B6. Despite the mixed conclusion of various studies regarding the level of these vitamins in elder people, studies recommended the treatment with folate and B12 to reduce Hcy levels in subjects with or without any defect in the enzymes involved in its metabolism. The levels of Hcy, folate, B6 as well as B12 should be measured early in patients with visual impairment that would aid to screen patients for life-threatening disorders related with HHcy. Elder patients may supplement with these vitamins in order to attenuate the ocular damages. This article discusses the association of Hcy in ocular diseases and the possible mechanism in the pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Methionine metabolism plays a central role in methylation reactions, production of glutathione and methylarginines, and modulating homocysteine levels. The mechanisms by which these are affected in NAFLD are not fully understood. The aim is to perform a metabolomic, molecular and epigenetic analyses of hepatic methionine metabolism in diet-induced NAFLD. Female 129S1/SvlmJ;C57Bl/6J mice were fed a chow (n = 6) or high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet (n = 8) for 52 weeks. Metabolomic study, enzymatic expression and DNA methylation analyses were performed. HFHC diet led to weight gain, marked steatosis and extensive fibrosis. In the methionine cycle, hepatic methionine was depleted (30%, p&lt; 0.01) while s-adenosylmethionine (SAM)/methionine ratio (p&lt; 0.05), s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (35%, p&lt; 0.01) and homocysteine (25%, p&lt; 0.01) were increased significantly. SAH hydrolase protein levels decreased significantly (p &lt;0.01). Serine, a substrate for both homocysteine remethylation and transsulfuration, was depleted (45%, p&lt; 0.01). In the transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine and cysteine trended upward while glutathione decreased significantly (p&lt; 0.05). In the transmethylation pathway, levels of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most abundant methyltransferase in the liver, decreased. The phosphatidylcholine (PC)/ phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio increased significantly (p&lt; 0.01), indicative of increased phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) activity. The protein levels of protein arginine methytransferase 1 (PRMT1) increased significantly, but its products, monomethylarginine (MMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), decreased significantly. Circulating ADMA increased and approached significance (p&lt; 0.06). Protein expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A, cystathionine ß-synthase, <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthetase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, and methionine synthase remained unchanged. Although gene expression of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a decreased, the global DNA methylation was unaltered. Among individual genes, only HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr) was hypermethylated, and no methylation changes were observed in fatty acid synthase (Fasn), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (Nf<U+03BA>b1), c-Jun, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Caspase 3. NAFLD was associated with hepatic methionine deficiency and homocysteine elevation, resulting mainly from impaired homocysteine remethylation, and aberrancy in methyltransferase reactions. Despite increased PRMT1 expression, hepatic ADMA was depleted while circulating ADMA was increased, suggesting increased export to circulation.</p>

<p>Mechanisms of vitamin function in non-mammals are poorly understood, despite being essential for development. Folate and cobalamin are B-vitamin cofactors with overlapping roles in transferring various single-carbon units. In mammals, one or both is needed for nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, amino acid conversions and other reactions. However, there has been little investigation of the response to folate or cobalamin in insects. Here, we manipulated folate intake and potentially cobalamin levels in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with chemically-defined diets, an antibiotic to reduce bacterially-derived vitamins, and the folate-interfering pharmaceutical methotrexate, to see if single-carbon metabolites and DNA synthesis rates would be affected. We found that similar to mammals with low folate intake, fruit fly larvae had significantly slower growth and DNA synthesis rates. But changes to single carbon-metabolites did not mirror that of mammals with abnormal folate or given MTX. Five of the nine metabolites measured were not significantly affected (methionine, serine, glycine, methylglycine, and dimethylglycine) and three (cystathionine, methylgycine, and methylmalonic acid) were only decreased in larvae consuming methotrexate. Metabolites expected to be elevated if flies used cobalamin from microbial symbionts were not affected by dietary sulfaquinoxaline. Our data support the role of folate in nucleotide synthesis in D. melanogaster and that microbial symbionts provide functioning folates. We could not confirm how folate intake affects single carbon pathway metabolites, nor whether Drososphila use microbially-derived cobalamin. Further work should explore which cofactors are used in fruit flies in these important and potentially novel pathways.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a form of regulated non-apoptotic cell death that has been implicated in several disease contexts. A better understanding of the ferroptotic death mechanism could lead to the development of new therapeutics for degenerative diseases, and a better understanding of how to induce ferroptosis in specific tumor contexts. We performed an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen to find genetic suppressors of ferroptosis. We determined that loss of CARS, the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, suppresses ferroptosis induced by erastin, which inhibits the cystine-glutamate antiporter known as system xc(-). Knockdown of CARS inhibited erastin-induced death by preventing the induction of lipid reactive oxygen species, without altering iron homeostasis. Knockdown of CARS led to the accumulation of cystathionine, a metabolite on the transsulfuration pathway, and upregulated genes associated with serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. In addition, inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway resensitized cells to erastin, even after CARS knockdown. These studies demonstrate a new mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis and may lead to strategies for inducing and suppressing ferroptosis in diverse contexts.</p>

<p>Whether long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) hypomethylation induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) was mediated through the depletion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was investigated. Bladder cancer (UM-UC-3 and TCCSUP) and human kidney (HK-2) cell lines were exposed to 20<U+2009>µM H2O2 for 72 h to induce oxidative stress. Level of LINE-1 methylation, SAM and homocysteine (Hcy) was measured in the H2O2 -exposed cells. Effects of a-tocopheryl acetate (TA), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), methionine, SAM and folic acid on oxidative stress and LINE-1 methylation in the H2O2 -treated cells were explored. Viabilities of cells treated with H2O2 were not significantly changed. Intracellular ROS production and protein carbonyl content were significantly increased, but LINE-1 methylation was significantly decreased in the H2O2 -treated cells. LINE-1 methylation was restored by TA, NAC, methionine, SAM and folic acid. SAM level in H2O2 -treated cells was significantly decreased, while total glutathione was significantly increased. SAM level in H2O2 -treated cells was restored by NAC, methionine, SAM and folic acid; while, total glutathione level was normalized by TA and NAC. Hcy was significantly decreased in the H2O2 -treated cells and subsequently restored by NAC. In conclusion, in bladder cancer and normal kidney cells exposed to H2O2 , SAM and Hcy were decreased, but total glutathione was increased. Treatments with antioxidants (TA and NAC) and one-carbon metabolites (SAM, methionine and folic acid) restored these changes. This pioneer finding suggests that exposure of cells to ROS activates glutathione synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway leading to deficiency of Hcy, which consequently causes SAM depletion and eventual hypomethylation of LINE-1.</p>

<p>Recent studies revealed increased expression of various hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzymes in cancer cells of various tissue types, and new roles of H2S in the pathophysiology of cancer have emerged. This is particularly evident in cancers of the colon and ovaries, where the malignant cells both overexpress cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and produce increased amounts of H2S, which enhances tumor growth and spread by (a) stimulating cellular bioenergetics, (b) activating proliferative, migratory, and invasive signaling pathways, and (c) enhancing tumor angiogenesis. Importantly, in preclinical models of these cancers, either pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of CBS was shown to be sufficient to suppress cancer cell bioenergetics in vitro, inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, and enhance the antitumor efficacy of frontline chemotherapeutic agents, providing a strong rationale for the development of CBS-targeted inhibitors as anticancer therapies. However, the observation that inhibition of H2S biosynthesis exerts anticancer effects is contradicted by other studies showing that increasing H2S with exogenous donors also exerts antitumor actions. Herein, we present a brief review of the scientific literature documenting the function of H2S, H2S donors, and transsulfuration enzymes in cancers from various tissue types, and propose that the paradoxical actions of H2S can be resolved by considering the bell-shaped pharmacology of H2S, whereby lower (endogenous) H2S production tends to promote, while higher (generated from exogenously added H2S donors) tends to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Finally, we suggest areas for future investigations to expand our knowledge of this nascent field.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that presents a spectrum of qualitative impairments in social interaction, communication, as well as restricted and stereotyped behavioral patterns, interests, and activities. Several studies have suggested that the etiology of ASD can be partly explained by oxidative stress. However, the implications of abnormal transsulfuration metabolism and oxidative stress, and their relation with ASD are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate several transsulfuration pathway metabolites in Chinese participants diagnosed with ASD, to better understand their role in the etiology of this disorder. Fifty children (39 male, 11 female) diagnosed with ASD and 50 age- and gender-matched non-ASD children (i.e., control group) were included in this study. This prospective blinded study was undertaken to assess transsulfuration and oxidative metabolites, including levels of homocysteine (Hcy), cysteine (Cys), total glutathione (tGSH), reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG). The clinical severity of ASD was evaluated with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and the autistic children’s present behavior was measured by the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). The results indicated that Hcy and GSSG levels were significantly higher in children diagnosed with ASD, Cys, tGSH and GSH levels as well as the GSH/GSSG ratio showed remarkably lower values in ASD children compared to control subjects. Hcy levels correlated significantly with increasing CARS scores and GSSG levels in children with ASD. Our results suggest that an abnormal transsulfuration metabolism and reduced antioxidant capacity (i.e., hyperhomocysteinemia and increased oxidative stress), and Hcy level appears to have a potentially negative impact on clinical severity of autistic disorder.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with inadequate recovery of damaged kidney. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) regulates a variety of cellular signals involved in cell death, differentiation and proliferation. This study aimed to identify the role of H2S and its producing enzymes in the recovery of kidney following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.METHODS: Mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia. Some mice were administered daily NaHS, an H2S donor, and propargylglycine (PAG), an inhibitor of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), during the recovery phase. Cell proliferation was assessed via 5’-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay.RESULTS: Ischemia resulted in decreases in CSE and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) expression and activity, and H2S level in the kidney. These decreases did not return to sham level until 8 days after ischemia when kidney had fibrotic lesions. NaHS administration to I/R-injured mice accelerated the recovery of renal function and tubule morphology, whereas PAG delayed that. Furthermore, PAG increased mortality after ischemia. NaHS administration to I/R-injured mice accelerated tubular cell proliferation, whereas it inhibited interstitial cell proliferation. In addition, NaHS treatment reduced post-I/R superoxide formation, lipid peroxidation, level of GSSG/GSH and Nox4 expression, whereas it increased catalase and MnSOD expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that H2S accelerates the recovery of I/R-induced kidney damage, suggesting that the H2S-producing transsulfuration pathway plays an important role in kidney repair after acute injury.</p>

<p>More than 80 years after its discovery, penicillin is still a widely used and commercially highly important antibiotic. Here, we analyse the metabolic network of penicillin synthesis in Penicillium chrysogenum based on the concept of elementary flux modes. In particular, we consider the synthesis of the invariant molecular core of the various subtypes of penicillin and the two major ways of incorporating sulfur: transsulfuration and direct sulfhydrylation. 66 elementary modes producing this invariant core are obtained. These show four different yields with respect to glucose, notably ½, 2/5, 1/3, and 2/7, with the highest yield of ½ occurring only when direct sulfhydrylation is used and a-aminoadipate is completely recycled. In the case of no recycling of this intermediate, we find the maximum yield to be 2/7. We compare these values with earlier literature values. Our analysis provides a systematic overview of the redundancy in penicillin synthesis and a detailed insight into the corresponding routes. Moreover, we derive suggestions for potential knockouts that could increase the average yield.</p>

<p>Methionine is an essential sulfur-containing amino acid that is metabolized mainly in the liver, where it is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by methionine adenosyltransferase. Importantly, SAM is a metabolically pleiotropic molecule that participates in three types of biochemical reactions; transmethylation, transsulfuration (which results in the transfer of sulfur from methionine to serine to form cysteine), and amino propylation (to synthesize polyamines). Critical roles of SAM in the liver have been extensively studied using transgenic animals with chronically reduced or increased hepatic SAM levels. Interestingly, both models with abnormal hepatic SAM concentrations develop liver disease suggesting that SAM homeostasis plays a pivotal role in liver disease. The transsulfuration pathway is connected to the production of glutathione (GSH), which has potent antioxidant capacity in the liver. Accumulating data show that GSH depletion renders the liver vulnerable to oxidative stress and prone to progression of liver disease. In this review, we highlight the importance of homeostasis in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids with a particular focus on the transsulfuration pathway which could be a promising therapeutic target in liver injury.</p>

<p>A child with severe S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) deficiency (AHCY c.428A&gt;G, p.Tyr143Cys; c.982T&gt;G, p.Tyr328Asp) presented at 8 months of age with growth failure, microcephaly, global developmental delay, myopathy, hepatopathy, and factor VII deficiency. Plasma methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) were markedly elevated and the molar concentration ratio of AdoMet:AdoHcy, believed to regulate a myriad of methyltransferase reactions, was 15% of the control mean. Dietary therapy failed to normalize biochemical markers or alter the AdoMet to AdoHcy molar concentration ratio. At 40 months of age, the proband received a liver segment from a healthy, unrelated living donor. Mean AdoHcy decreased 96% and the AdoMet:AdoHcy concentration ratio improved from 0.52±0.19 to 1.48±0.79 mol:mol (control 4.10±2.11 mol:mol). Blood methionine and AdoMet were normal and stable during 6 months of follow-up on an unrestricted diet. Average calculated tissue methyltransferase activity increased from 43±26% to 60±22%, accompanied by signs of increased transmethylation in vivo. Factor VII activity increased from 12% to 100%. During 6 postoperative months, head growth accelerated 4-fold and the patient made promising gains in gross motor, language, and social skills.</p>

<p>The present study aimed to evaluate effects of a water-soluble protein fraction of chicken (CP), with a low methionine/glycine ratio, on plasma homocysteine and metabolites related to homocysteine metabolism. Male Wistar rats were fed either a control diet with 20% w/w casein as the protein source, or an experimental diet where 6, 14 or 20% w/w of the casein was replaced with the same amount of CP for four weeks. Rats fed CP had reduced plasma total homocysteine level and markedly increased levels of the choline pathway metabolites betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, glycine and serine, as well as the transsulfuration pathway metabolites cystathionine and cysteine. Hepatic mRNA level of enzymes involved in homocysteine remethylation, methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, were unchanged, whereas cystathionine gamma-lyase of the transsulfuration pathway was increased in the CP treated rats. Plasma concentrations of vitamin B2, folate, cobalamin, and the B-6 catabolite pyridoxic acid were increased in the 20% CP-treated rats. In conclusion, the CP diet was associated with lower plasma homocysteine concentration and higher levels of serine, choline oxidation and transsulfuration metabolites compared to a casein diet. The status of related B-vitamins was also affected by CP.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, Hcy-lowering strategies were found to have limited effects in reducing cardiovascular events. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence reveals a role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of HHcy. Homocysteine (Hcy) is a precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is formed via the transsulfuration pathway catalyzed by cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and serves as a novel modulator of inflammation. In the present study, we showed that methionine supplementation induced mild HHcy in mice, associated with the elevations of TNF-a and IL-1ß in the plasma and reductions of plasma H2S level and CSE expression in the peritoneal macrophages. H2S-releasing compound GYY4137 attenuated the increases of TNF-a and IL-1ß in the plasma of HHcy mice and Hcy-treated raw264.7 cells while CSE inhibitor PAG exacerbated it. Moreover, the in vitro study showed that Hcy inhibited CSE expression and H2S production in macrophages, accompanied by the increases of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression and DNA hypermethylation in cse promoter region. DNMT inhibition or knockdown reversed the decrease of CSE transcription induced by Hcy in macrophages. In sum, our findings demonstrate that Hcy may trigger inflammation through inhibiting CSE-H2S signaling, associated with increased promoter DNA methylation and transcriptional repression of cse in macrophages.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma total homocysteine (Hcy) level is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). During transsulfuration pathways, Hcy is metabolized into hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is a synaptic modulator, as well as a neuro-protective agent. However, the role of hydrogen sulfide, as well as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and synaptic dysfunction, leading to AD pathology is not clear. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibition of neuronal NMDA-R by H2S and MK801 mitigate the Hcy-induced BBB disruption and synapse dysfunction, in part by decreasing neuronal matrix degradation. Hcy intracerebral (IC) treatment significantly impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral circulation and memory function. Hcy treatment also decreases the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the brain along with increased expression of NMDA-R (NR1) and synaptosomal Ca(2+) indicating excitotoxicity. Additionally, we found that Hcy treatment increased protein and mRNA expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 and also increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in the brain. The increased expression of ICAM-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and claudin-5 indicates BBB disruption and vascular inflammation. Moreover, we also found decreased expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP-97), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), synaptophysin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) showing synapse dysfunction in the hippocampus. Furthermore, NaHS and MK801 treatment ameliorates BBB disruption, CBF, and synapse functions in the mice brain. These results demonstrate a neuro-protective effect of H2S over Hcy-induced cerebrovascular pathology through the NMDA receptor. Our present study clearly signifies the therapeutic ramifications of H2S for cerebrovascular diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Graphical Abstract <U+115F>.</p>

<p>Measures of B6 status are categorized as direct biomarkers and as functional biomarkers. Direct biomarkers measure B6 vitamers in plasma/serum, urine and erythrocytes, and among these plasma pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) is most commonly used. Functional biomarkers include erythrocyte transaminase activities and, more recently, plasma levels of metabolites involved in PLP-dependent reactions, such as the kynurenine pathway, one-carbon metabolism, transsulfuration (cystathionine), and glycine decarboxylation (serine and glycine). Vitamin B6 status is best assessed by using a combination of biomarkers because of the influence of potential confounders, such as inflammation, alkaline phosphatase activity, low serum albumin, renal function, and inorganic phosphate. Ratios between substrate-products pairs have recently been investigated as a strategy to attenuate such influence. These efforts have provided promising new markers such as the PAr index, the 3-hydroxykynurenine:xanthurenic acid ratio, and the oxoglutarate:glutamate ratio. Targeted metabolic profiling or untargeted metabolomics based on mass spectrometry allow the simultaneous quantification of a large number of metabolites, which are currently evaluated as functional biomarkers, using data reduction statistics.</p>

<p>It is now clear that homocysteine (Hcy) is irreversibly degraded to hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous gasotransmitter that causes in vivo platelet activation via upregulation of phospholipase A2 and downstream boost of the arachidonate cascade. This mechanism involves a transsulfuration pathway. Based on these new data, clinical and experimental models on the relationships between Hcy and folate pathways in vascular disease and information on the Hcy controversy have been reanalyzed in the present review. Most interventional trials focused on Hcy lowering by folate administration did not exclude patients routinely taking the arachidonate inhibitor aspirin. This may have influenced the results of some of these trials. It is also clear that nutritional intake of folate affects several enzymatic reactions of the methionine-Hcy cycle and associated one-carbon metabolism and, thereby, both methylation reactions and redox balance. Hence, it is conceivable that the abnormally high Hcy levels seen in pathologic states reflect a poorly elucidated perturbation of such reactions and of such balance. While it is unknown whether there is an interplay between H2S, methylation reactions, and redox balance, measuring the sole reduction of blood Hcy that follows folate administration may well be an oversimplified approach to a complex biologic perturbation. The need to investigate this complex framework is thoroughly discussed in this article.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders are a group of mental illnesses highly correlated with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that there may be one or more microbial “fingerprints” in terms of the composition characterizing individuals with autism, which could be used for diagnostic purposes. This paper proposes a computational approach whereby metagenomes characteristic of “healthy” and autistic individuals are artificially constructed via genomic information, analyzed for the enzymes coded within, and then these enzymes are compared in detail. This is a text mining application. A custom-designed online application was built and used for the comparative metabolomics study and made publically available. Several of the enzyme-catalyzing reactions involved with the amino acid glutamate were curiously missing from the “autism” microbiome and were coded within almost every organism included in the “control” microbiome. Interestingly, there exists a leading hypothesis regarding autism and glutamate involving a neurological excitation/inhibition imbalance; but the association with this study is unclear. The results included data on the transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways, involved with oxidative stress, also of importance to autism. The results from this study are in alignment with leading hypotheses in the field, which is impressive, considering the purely in silico nature of this study. The present study provides new insight into the complex metabolic interactions underlying autism, and this novel methodology has potential to be useful for developing new hypotheses. However, limitations include sparse genome data availability and conflicting literature experimental data. We believe our software tool and methodology has potential for having great utility as data become more available, comprehensive and reliable.</p>

<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with increased plasma homocysteine level, which is caused by down-regulation of hepatic cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity. CBS catalyzes the first step in the transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine, which contributes ~50% of the cysteine required for hepatic biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH), the most abundant antioxidant in cells. As the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g. exendin-4) effectively reverse hepatic steatosis, the effect of exendin-4 on both homocysteine and redox status was investigated in the livers of rats fed with high-fat diet (HFD). It was found that HFD down-regulated CBS protein expression, which was probably due to induction of rno-miR-376c expression in the liver. The level of GSH was markedly reduced, whereas the level of malonydialdehyde, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased in the livers of rats fed with HFD. Exendin-4 treatment increased hepatic CBS protein and GSH levels, and reduced malonydialdehyde level in hyperlipidemic rats. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists have beneficial effects on redox homeostasis in NAFLD.</p>

<p>Methionine is a sulfur amino acid standing at the crossroads of several biosynthetic pathways. In fungi, the last step of methionine biosynthesis is catalyzed by a cobalamine-independent methionine synthase (Met6, EC 2.1.1.14). In the present work, we studied the role of Met6 in the infection process of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. To this end MET6 null mutants were obtained by targeted gene replacement. On minimum medium, MET6 null mutants were auxotrophic for methionine. Even when grown in presence of excess methionine, these mutants displayed developmental defects, such as reduced mycelium pigmentation, aerial hypha formation and sporulation. They also displayed characteristic metabolic signatures such as increased levels of cysteine, cystathionine, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine while methionine and glutathione levels remained unchanged. These metabolic perturbations were associated with the over-expression of MgCBS1 involved in the reversed transsulfuration pathway that metabolizes homocysteine into cysteine and MgSAM1 and MgSAHH1 involved in the methyl cycle. This suggests a physiological adaptation of M. oryzae to metabolic defects induced by the loss of Met6, in particular an increase in homocysteine levels. Pathogenicity assays showed that MET6 null mutants were non-pathogenic on both barley and rice leaves. These mutants were defective in appressorium-mediated penetration and invasive infectious growth. These pathogenicity defects were rescued by addition of exogenous methionine and S-methylmethionine. These results show that M. oryzae cannot assimilate sufficient methionine from plant tissues and must synthesize this amino acid de novo to fulfill its sulfur amino acid requirement during infection.</p>

<p>Right-sided and left-sided obstructive heart defects (OHDs) are subtypes of congenital heart defects, in which the heart valves, arteries, or veins are abnormally narrow or blocked. Previous studies have suggested that the development of OHDs involved a complex interplay between genetic variants and maternal factors. Using the data from 569 OHD case families and 1,644 control families enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) between 1997 and 2008, we conducted an analysis to investigate the genetic effects of 877 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 60 candidate genes for association with the risk of OHDs, and their interactions with maternal use of folic acid supplements, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Applying log-linear models based on the hybrid design, we identified a SNP in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (C677T polymorphism) with a main genetic effect on the occurrence of OHDs. In addition, multiple SNPs in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT and BHMT2) were also identified to be associated with the occurrence of OHDs through significant main infant genetic effects and interaction effects with maternal use of folic acid supplements. We also identified multiple SNPs in glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC) and DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B) that were associated with elevated risk of OHDs among obese women. Our findings suggested that the risk of OHDs was closely related to a combined effect of variations in genes in the folate, homocysteine, or glutathione/transsulfuration pathways, maternal use of folic acid supplements and pre-pregnancy obesity.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia (PE) is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. The studies suggest that both polymorphisms and changes of expression in genes encoding enzymes involved in the methionine and homocysteine metabolism (MHM), such as methylenetetrahydrofolate, reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), could play a role in the development of hypertension during pregnancy. The aim of the study was to determine the expression level of MTHFR, MTR, MTRR and CSE genes in the development of PE in Caucasian women.STUDY DESIGN: The control group consisted of 74 healthy pregnant women and 90 patients with diagnosed pre-eclampsia. Total RNA was isolated from placenta and the mRNA level of examined genes was to determine using real-time PCR.RESULTS: The expression level of MTHFR gene showed no statistically significant difference in the study group as compared to the control group. An increase of mRNA levels for MTR and CTH was observed by 124.7% (p&lt;0.0001) and 26.6% (p&gt;0.05), respectively. However, a decrease of placental expression was noted for MTRR by 50% in preeclamptic women as compared to control group (p&lt;0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the elevated RNA expression of MTR in placenta of preeclamptic patients is probably results of a potential compensation mechanism of the MHM while elevated CSE expression indicates that homocysteine may be eliminated through the alternate transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>Measuring biological responses in resident biota is a commonly used approach to monitoring polluted habitats. The challenge is to choose sensitive and, ideally, stressor-specific endpoints that reflect the responses of the ecosystem. Metabolomics is a potentially useful approach for identifying sensitive and consistent responses since it provides a holistic view to understanding the effects of exposure to chemicals upon the physiological functioning of organisms. In this study, we exposed the aquatic non-biting midge, Chironomus tepperi, to two concentrations of zinc chloride and measured global changes in polar metabolite levels using an untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and a targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of amine-containing metabolites. These data were correlated with changes in the expression of a number of target genes. Zinc exposure resulted in a reduction in levels of intermediates in carbohydrate metabolism (i.e., glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and disaccharides) and an increase in a number of TCA cycle intermediates. Zinc exposure also resulted in decreases in concentrations of the amine containing metabolites, lanthionine, methionine and cystathionine, and an increase in metallothionein gene expression. Methionine and cystathionine are intermediates in the transsulfuration pathway which is involved in the conversion of methionine to cysteine. These responses provide an understanding of the pathways affected by zinc toxicity, and how these effects are different to other heavy metals such as cadmium and copper. The use of complementary metabolomics analytical approaches was particularly useful for understanding the effects of zinc exposure and importantly, identified a suite of candidate biomarkers of zinc exposure useful for the development of biomonitoring programs.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma homocysteine levels are considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Experimental evidence has shown that hydrogen sulfide anion (HS(-)) protects the myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Both homocysteine levels and endogenous HS(-) production are mainly regulated by two transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). We hypothesized that the transsulfuration pathway plays essential roles in the development of cardiac adaptive responses against ischemia, and investigated the roles of homocysteine, HS(-), and transsulfuration enzymes in fasting-induced cardioprotection against IR injury utilizing hyperhomocysteinemic Cbs (-/-) and Cth (-/-) mice. Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to 25-min global ischemia, followed by 60-min reperfusion. Two-day fasting ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction after reperfusion via propargylglycine- and glibenclamide-sensitive pathways in wild-type mice but not in Cbs (-/-) or Cth (-/-) mice, although fasting induced cardiac expression of several Nrf2 target antioxidant genes in both wild-type and Cth (-/-) mice. Intraperitoneal administration of sodium hydrosulfide (a HS(-) donor) at 24 h prior to IR improved myocardial recovery in wild-type mice but not in Cth (-/-) or high-methionine-diet-fed (thus intermediately hyperhomocysteinemic) wild-type mice. Quantitative analysis of reactive sulfur species using monobromobimane derivatization methods revealed that homocysteine efficiently captures HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide in the hearts as well as in the in vitro reactions. Here we propose a novel molecular and pathophysiological basis for hyperhomocysteinemia; excessive circulatory homocysteine interferes with HS(-)-related cardioprotection against IR injury by capturing endogenous HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide.</AbstractText>: Elevated plasma homocysteine levels are considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

Two-day fasting ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction after reperfusion via propargylglycine- and glibenclamide-sensitive pathways in wild-type mice but not in Cbs (-/-) or Cth (-/-) mice, although fasting induced cardiac expression of several Nrf2 target antioxidant genes in both wild-type and Cth (-/-) mice. Intraperitoneal administration of sodium hydrosulfide (a HS(-) donor) at 24 h prior to IR improved myocardial recovery in wild-type mice but not in Cth (-/-) or high-methionine-diet-fed (thus intermediately hyperhomocysteinemic) wild-type mice. Quantitative analysis of reactive sulfur species using monobromobimane derivatization methods revealed that homocysteine efficiently captures HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide in the hearts as well as in the in vitro reactions. Here we propose a novel molecular and pathophysiological basis for hyperhomocysteinemia; excessive circulatory homocysteine interferes with HS(-)-related cardioprotection against IR injury by capturing endogenous HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide.KEY MESSAGE: Two-day fasting of mice ameliorates ischemia/reperfusion injury in Langendorff hearts. H2S-producing enzymes, CBS and CTH, are essential in fasting-induced cardioprotection. Administration of a H2S donor (NaHS) confers cardioprotection against IR injury. NaHS effects are absent in Cth (-/-), Cbs (-/-), and dietary hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Homocysteine captures cardioprotective HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide.</p>

<p>H2S is produced from sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine and homocysteine, or a catabolite, 3-mercaptopyruvate, by three known enzymes: cystathionine ß-synthase, <U+03B3>-cystathionase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Of these, the first two enzymes reside in the cytoplasm and comprise the transsulfuration pathway, while the third enzyme is found both in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondrion. The following mitochondrial enzymes oxidize H2S: sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, sulfur dioxygenase, rhodanese, and sulfite oxidase. The products of the sulfide oxidation pathway are thiosulfate and sulfate. Assays for enzymes involved in the production and oxidative clearance of sulfide to thiosulfate are described in this chapter.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Pain in CP results from inflammation and neuroimmune alterations that are associated with oxidative stress, among other mechanisms. This is marked by depletion of antioxidant defenses including methionine, which is a donor of methyl moieties that maintains the acinar transsulfuration pathway. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials evaluating methionine-containing antioxidants in CP.PATIENT AND METHODS: Literature search was conducted in Medline/Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Systematic review and meta-analysis was performed per PRISMA guidelines. Main study outcome was pain relief. GRADE system was used for quality assessment. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q and I(2) measures; publication bias by Egger’s test. Random-effect model (DerSimonian and Laird) was used if there was heterogeneity.RESULTS: Eight studies (n = 411) were identified that used methionine-containing antioxidants. The study duration ranged from 10 wks to 12 months. All studies used methionine, organic selenium, ascorbate, beta-carotene and alpha-tocoferol. Four studies (including two RCTs) that reported change in pain scores were metaanalyzed. Though overall effect [standardized difference in means (95% CI)] on pain score reduction was -0.95 (-1.738 to -0.160) (z = -2.36; p = 0.018), the significance was lost when the two RCTs were meta-analyzed. RCTs that reported the number of pain free patients had a statistically significant overall effect of -3.204 (p = 0.001). Though more patients on methionine containing antioxidants had adverse events, majority of them were mild.CONCLUSION: Methionine containing antioxidants appear to result in pain reduction in a significant proportion of CP patients. Further randomized controlled trials with homogeneous outcome measures are needed.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: The cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism because it catalyzes the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, during which homocysteine is converted to cystathionine. Polymorphisms of CBS have been associated with cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined the role of the 844ins68 polymorphism by comparing the genotypes of 371 healthy Mexican women with the genotypes of 323 Mexican women with breast cancer (BC).RESULTS: The observed genotype frequencies for controls and BC patients were 1% and 2% for Ins/Ins, 13% and 26% for W/Ins, and 86% and 72% for W/W, respectively. We found that the odds ratio (OR) was 2.2, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.5-3.3, p = 0.0001. The association was also evident when comparing the distribution of the W/Ins-Ins/Ins genotypes in patients in the following categories: 1) menopause and high <U+03B3>-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels (OR of 2.17, 95% CI: 1.17-4.26, p = 0.02), 2) chemotherapy response and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.08-4.4, p = 0.027), 3) chemotherapy response and high GGT levels (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.2-4.8, p = 0.007), and 4) body mass index (BMI) and III-IV tumor stage (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.2-8.3, p = 0.013).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the genotypes W/Ins-Ins/Ins of the 844ins68 polymorphism in the CBS gene contribute significantly to BC susceptibility in the analyzed sample from the Mexican population.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common encephalic malignant tumors. Due to a high recurrence rate and a lack of effective treatments, the average survival rate remains low. Temozolomide (TMZ), a class of alkylating agent, is widely used as a first-line therapeutic drug during the adjuvant treatment for GBM patients. However, most patients exhibit a palpable resistance to TMZ treatment. Additionally, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. In this study, glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were found to be closely associated with the sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ. We also found that TMZ markedly induced xCT, the subunit of glutamate/cystine transporter system xc- expression, which together with the GSH synthesis was increased while the TMZ-inducible ROS level was decreased in GBM cells. In addition, the cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH) acivity, a key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway was enhanced by TMZ, which insured a cysteine supply and GSH synthesis in a compensatory manner when xCT was blocked. Thus, the individual inhibition of xCT by siRNA and a pharmacological inhibitor (sulfasalazine) only partially inhibited GSH synthesis and moderately enhanced the GBM cell sensitivity to TMZ. However, the TMZ-induced cytotoxicity was markedly increased along with a marked decrease in GSH levels as result of co-treatment with erastin, which inhibited cysteine uptake from xCT transporter and suppressed CTH activity, leading to impaired transformation from methionine to cysteine. In conclusion, to GBM therapy with a drug combination of TMZ and erastin may be beneficial.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Extending mammalian health span and life span has been achieved under a variety of dietary restriction protocols. Reducing the intake of a specific amino acid has also been shown to extend health and longevity. We recently reported that methionine (MET) restriction is not effective in life span extension in growth hormone (GH) signaling mutants. To better understand the apparent necessity of GH in the ‘sensing’ of altered dietary MET, the current study was designed to evaluate MET and glutathione (GSH) metabolism (as well as other pathways) in long-living GH-deficient Ames dwarf and wild-type mice following 8 weeks of restricted (0.16%), low (0.43%), or enriched (1.3%) dietary MET consumption. Metabolite expression was examined in liver tissue, while gene and protein expression were evaluated in liver, kidney, and muscle tissues.RESULTS: Body weight was maintained in dwarf mice on the MET diets, while wild-type mice on higher levels of MET gained weight. Liver MET levels were similar in Ames mice, while several MET pathway enzymes were elevated regardless of dietary MET intake. Transsulfuration enzymes were also elevated in Ames mice but differences in cysteine levels were not different between genotypes. Dwarf mice maintained higher levels of GSH on MET restriction compared to wild-type mice, while genotype and diet effects were also detected in thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. MET restriction increased transmethylation in both genotypes as indicated by increased S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), betaine, and dimethylglycine. Diet did not impact levels of glycolytic components, but dwarf mice exhibited higher levels of key members of this pathway. Coenzyme A and measures of fatty acid oxidation were elevated in dwarf mice and unaffected by diet.CONCLUSIONS: This component analysis between Ames and wild-type mice suggests that the life span differences observed may result from the atypical MET metabolism and downstream effects on multiple systems. The overall lack of responsiveness to the different diets is well reflected across many metabolic pathways in dwarf mice indicating the importance of GH signaling in the ability to discriminate dietary amino acid levels.</p>

<p>Homocysteine accumulation has numerous deleterious effects, and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) catalyses the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and betaine. This study aimed to determine homocysteine concentrations, and mRNA expression levels and protein abundances of bhmt1/Bhmt1 in the liver, kidney and muscle of the African lungfish, Protopterus annectens, during the induction (6 days), maintenance (6 months) or arousal (3 days after arousal) phase of aestivation. The homocysteine concentration decreased significantly in the liver of P. annectens after 6 days or 6 months of aestivation, but it returned to the control level upon arousal. By contrast, homocysteine concentrations in the kidney and muscle remained unchanged during the three phases of aestivation. The complete coding cDNA sequence of bhmt1 from P. annectens consisted of 1236 bp, coding for 412 amino acids. The Bhmt1 from P. annectens had a close phylogenetic relationship with those from tetrapods and Callorhinchus milii. The expression of bhmt1 was detected in multiple organs/tissues of P. annectens, and this is the first report on the expression of bhmt1/Bhmt1 in animal skeletal muscle. The mRNA and protein expression levels of bhmt1/Bhmt1 were up-regulated in the liver of P. annectens during the induction and maintenance phases of aestivation, possibly to regulate the hepatic homocysteine concentration. The significant increase in hepatic Bhmt1 protein abundance during the arousal phase could be a response to increased cellular methylation for the purpose of tissue reconstruction. Unlike the liver, Bhmt1 expression in the kidney and muscle of P. annectens was regulated translationally, and its up-regulation could be crucial to prevent homocysteine accumulation.</p>

<p>The term ‘one-carbon metabolism’ is commonly used to describe 3 separate metabolic processes: folate metabolism, the homocysteine remethylation cycle, and the transsulfuration pathway. Folate metabolism concerns the biochemical reactions in which endogenous and exogenous one-carbon units are transferred to tetrahydrofolates. The remethylation cycle is used for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine with one-carbon units that come from folate. This methionine is thenfused for the synthesis of S-adenosyl methionine, which is a general donor of methyl groups for many biochemical reactions in the human body. In the transsulfuration pathway, some amino acids and polypeptides, such as cystathionine, cysteine, and glutathione, are synthesized from homocysteine. The kinetics of the enzymes in this pathway are regulated by the substrates of the remethylation cycle. The methylation process has been thought to have an important role in the biochemical basis of neuropsychiatry. An elevated homocysteine level is the most important marker of folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies, and also the most reliable biochemical sign of functional insufficiency. Some neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, such as psychosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism, have been found to be related to disorders of one-carbon metabolism. This review aims to summarize both one-carbon metabolism and its relationships with neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Dietary restriction (DR) without malnutrition encompasses numerous regimens with overlapping benefits including longevity and stress resistance, but unifying nutritional and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In a mouse model of DR-mediated stress resistance, we found that sulfur amino acid (SAA) restriction increased expression of the transsulfuration pathway (TSP) enzyme cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL), resulting in increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production and protection from hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury. SAA supplementation, mTORC1 activation, or chemical/genetic CGL inhibition reduced H2S production and blocked DR-mediated stress resistance. In vitro, the mitochondrial protein SQR was required for H2S-mediated protection during nutrient/oxygen deprivation. Finally, TSP-dependent H2S production was observed in yeast, worm, fruit fly, and rodent models of DR-mediated longevity. Together, these data are consistent with evolutionary conservation of TSP-mediated H2S as a mediator of DR benefits with broad implications for clinical translation. PAPERFLICK:</p>

<p>Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP; a B6 vitamer) serves as an important cofactor in a myriad of metabolic reactions, including the transsulfuration (TS) pathway, which converts homocysteine (Hcy) to cysteine. While overt vitamin B6 deficiency is rare, moderate deficiency is common and may be exacerbated by anti-pyridoxine factors in the food supply. To this end, we developed a model of moderate B6 deficiency and a study was conducted to examine the in vivo effect of 1-amino D-proline (1ADP), an anti-pyridoxine factor found in flaxseed, on indices of Hcy metabolism through the TS pathway in moderately B6 deficient rats. Male weaning rats received a semi-purified diet containing either 7 mg/kg (control; CD) or 0.7 mg/kg (moderately deficient; MD) diet of pyridoxine·hydrochloride (PN·HCl), each with 1 of 4 levels of 1ADP, viz. 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg diet for 5 weeks. Perturbations in vitamin B6 biomarkers were more pronounced in the MD group. Plasma PLP was significantly reduced, while plasma Hcy (8-fold) and cystathionine (11-fold) were increased in rats consuming the highest amount of 1ADP in the MD group. The activities of hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase enzymes were significantly reduced in rats consuming the highest 1ADP compared to the lowest, for both levels of PN·HCl. Dilation of hepatic central veins and sinusoids, mild steatosis and increased liver triglycerides were present in MD rats consuming the highest 1ADP level. The current data provide evidence that the consumption of an anti-pyridoxine factor linked to flaxseed may pose a risk for subjects who are moderate/severe vitamin B6 deficient.</p>

<p>H2S is a gas easily identified by its distinctive odor. Although environmental exposure to H2S has been viewed alternately as therapeutic or toxic through the centuries, H2S has recently regained recognition for its numerous beneficial biological effects. Most experiments documenting such benefits, including improved glucose tolerance, increased stress resistance, and even lifespan extension, are based on exposure of experimental organisms to exogenous sources of H2S. However, appreciation is growing for the importance of H2S produced endogenously by the evolutionary conserved transsulfuration pathway (TSP) in health and longevity. Recent data implicate H2S produced by the TSP in pleiotropic benefits of dietary restriction (DR), or reduced nutrient/energy intake without malnutrition. DR, best known as the most reliable way to extend lifespan in a wide range of experimental organisms, includes various regimens aimed at either reducing overall calorie intake (calorie restriction, intermittent/every-other-day fasting) or reducing particular nutrients such as protein or the essential amino acid, methionine (methionine restriction), with overlapping functional benefits on stress resistance, metabolic fitness and lifespan. Here we will review the small but growing body of literature linking the TSP to the functional benefits of DR in part through the production of endogenous H2S, with an emphasis on regulation of the TSP and H2S production by diet and mechanisms of beneficial H2S action.</p>

<p>The key mechanism for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, a potent electrophile that forms protein adducts. Previous studies revealed the fundamental role of glutathione, which binds to and detoxifies N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine. Glutathione is synthesized from cysteine in the liver, and N-acetylcysteine is used as a sole antidote for acetaminophen poisoning. Here, we evaluated the potential roles of transsulfuration enzymes essential for cysteine biosynthesis, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH), in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity using hemizygous (Cbs(+/-) or Cth(+/-)) and homozygous (Cth(-/-)) knockout mice. At 4 h after intraperitoneal acetaminophen injection, serum alanine aminotransferase levels were highly elevated in Cth(-/-) mice at 150 mg/kg dose, and also in Cbs(+/-) or Cth(+/-) mice at 250 mg/kg dose, which was associated with characteristic centrilobular hepatocyte oncosis. Hepatic glutathione was depleted while serum malondialdehyde accumulated in acetaminophen-injected Cth(-/-) mice but not wild-type mice, although glutamate-cysteine ligase (composed of catalytic [GCLC] and modifier [GCLM] subunits) became more activated in the livers of Cth(-/-) mice with lower Km values for Cys and Glu. Proteome analysis using fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis revealed 47 differentially expressed proteins after injection of 150 mg acetaminophen/kg into Cth(-/-) mice; the profiles were similar to 1000 mg acetaminophen/kg-treated wild-type mice. The prevalence of Cbs or Cth hemizygosity is estimated to be 1:200-300 population; therefore, the deletion or polymorphism of either transsulfuration gene may underlie idiosyncratic acetaminophen vulnerability along with the differences in Cyp, Gclc, and Gclm gene activities.</p>

<p>Scientific appreciation for the subtlety of brain sulfur chemistry has lagged, despite understanding that the brain must maintain high glutathione (GSH) to protect against oxidative stress in tissue that has both a high rate of oxidative respiration and a high content of oxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids. In fact, the brain was long thought to lack a complete transsulfuration pathway (TSP) for cysteine synthesis. It is now clear that not only does the brain possess a functional TSP, but brain TSP enzymes catalyze a rich array of alternative reactions that generate novel species including the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the atypical amino acid lanthionine (Lan). Moreover, TSP intermediates can be converted to unusual cyclic ketimines via transamination. Cell-penetrating derivatives of one such compound, lanthionine ketimine (LK), have potent antioxidant, neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and antineuroinflammatory actions and mitigate diverse neurodegenerative conditions in preclinical rodent models. This review will explore the source and function of alternative TSP products, and lanthionine-derived metabolites in particular. The known biological origins of lanthionine and its ketimine metabolite will be described in detail and placed in context with recent discoveries of a GSH- and LK-binding brain protein called LanCL1 that is proving essential for neuronal antioxidant defense; and a related LanCL2 homolog now implicated in immune sensing and cell fate determinations. The review will explore possible endogenous functions of lanthionine metabolites and will discuss the therapeutic potential of lanthionine ketimine derivatives for mitigating diverse neurological conditions including Alzheimer<U+05F3>s disease, stroke, motor neuron disease, and glioma.</p>

<p>CD44 expressed in cancer cells was shown to stabilize cystine transporter (xCT) that uptakes cystine and excretes glutamate to supply cysteine as a substrate for reduced glutathione (GSH) for survival. While targeting CD44 serves as a potentially therapeutic stratagem to attack cancer growth and chemoresistance, the impact of CD44 targeting in cancer cells on metabolic systems of tumors and host tissues in vivo remains to be fully determined. This study aimed to reveal effects of CD44 silencing on alterations in energy metabolism and sulfur-containing metabolites in vitro and in vivo using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry and quantitative imaging mass spectrometry (Q-IMS), respectively. In an experimental model of xenograft transplantation of human colon cancer HCT116 cells in superimmunodeficient NOG mice, snap-frozen liver tissues containing metastatic tumors were examined by Q-IMS. As reported previously, short hairpin CD44 RNA interference (shCD44) in cancer cells caused significant regression of tumor growth in the host liver. Under these circumstances, the CD44 knockdown suppressed polyamines, GSH and energy charges not only in metastatic tumors but also in the host liver. In culture, HCT116 cells treated with shCD44 decreased total amounts of methionine-pool metabolites including spermidine and spermine, and reactive cysteine persulfides, suggesting roles of these metabolites for cancer growth. Collectively, these results suggest that CD44 expressed in cancer accounts for a key regulator of metabolic interplay between tumor and the host tissue.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency confers diverse clinical manifestations. It is characterized by elevated plasma homocysteine levels, a common amino acid metabolized by remethylation to methionine or transsulfuration to cysteine. We recently found a relationship between hepatic Dyrk1A protein expression, a serine/threonine kinase involved in signal transduction in biological processes, hepatic S-adenosylhomocysteine activity, and plasma homocysteine levels. We aimed to study whether there is also a relationship between Dyrk1a and cystathionine beta synthase activity. We used different murine models carrying altered gene coy numbers for Dyrk1a, and found a decreased cystathionine beta synthase activity in the liver of mice under-expressing Dyrk1a, and an increased in liver of mice over-expressing Dyrk1a. For each model, a positive correlation was found between cystathionine beta synthase activity and Dyrk1a protein expression in the liver of mice, which was confirmed in a non-modified genetic context. The positive correlation found between liver Dyrk1a protein expression and CBS activity in modified and non-modified genetic context strengthens the role of this kinase in one carbon metabolism.</p>

<p>Lean body mass (LBM) encompasses all metabolically active organs distributed into visceral and structural tissue compartments and collecting the bulk of N and K stores of the human body. Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein mainly secreted by the liver within a trimolecular TTR-RBP-retinol complex revealing from birth to old age strikingly similar evolutionary patterns with LBM in health and disease. TTR is also synthesized by the choroid plexus along distinct regulatory pathways. Chronic dietary methionine (Met) deprivation or cytokine-induced inflammatory disorders generates LBM downsizing following differentiated physiopathological processes. Met-restricted regimens downregulate the transsulfuration cascade causing upstream elevation of homocysteine (Hcy) safeguarding Met homeostasis and downstream drop of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) impairing anti-oxidative capacities. Elderly persons constitute a vulnerable population group exposed to increasing Hcy burden and declining H2S protection, notably in plant-eating communities or in the course of inflammatory illnesses. Appropriate correction of defective protein status and eradication of inflammatory processes may restore an appropriate LBM size allowing the hepatic production of the retinol circulating complex to resume, in contrast with the refractory choroidal TTR secretory process. As a result of improved health status, augmented concentrations of plasma-derived TTR and retinol may reach the cerebrospinal fluid and dismantle senile amyloid plaques, contributing to the prevention or the delay of the onset of neurodegenerative events in elderly subjects at risk of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been increased interest in bacterial methionine biosynthesis enzymes as antimicrobial targets because of their pivotal role in cell metabolism. C-S lyase from Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a pyridoxal 5’-phosphate-dependent enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway that catalyzes the a,ß-elimination of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as L-cystathionine, to generate ammonia, pyruvate, and homocysteine, the immediate precursor of L-methionine. In order to gain deeper insight into the functional and dynamic properties of the enzyme, mutants of two highly conserved active-site residues, Y55F and Y114F, were characterized by UV-visible absorbance, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy in the absence and presence of substrates and substrate analogs, as well as by steady-state kinetic studies. Substitution of Tyr55 with Phe apparently causes a 130-fold decrease in K(d)(PLP) at pH 8.5 providing evidence that Tyr55 plays a role in cofactor binding. Moreover, spectral data show that the mutant accumulates the external aldimine intermediate suggesting that the absence of interaction between the hydroxyl moiety and PLP-binding residue Lys222 causes a decrease in the rate of substrate deprotonation. Mutation of Tyr114 with Phe slightly influences hydrolysis of L-cystathionine, and causes a change in substrate specificity towards L-serine and O-acetyl-L-serine compared to the wild type enzyme. These findings, together with computational data, provide useful insights in the substrate specificity of C-S lyase, which seems to be regulated by active-site architecture and by the specific conformation in which substrates are bound, and will aid in development of inhibitors.</p>

<p>Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) has emerged as a leading nosocomial pathogen because of its resistance to most currently available antibiotics. Cystathionine ß-lyase (CBL), a pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the second step in the transsulfuration pathway, which is essential for the metabolic interconversion of the sulfur-containing amino acids homocysteine and methionine. The enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway are considered to be attractive drug targets owing to their specificity to microbes and plants. As a potential target for the development of novel antibacterial drugs, the AbCBL protein was expressed, purified and crystallized. An AbCBL crystal diffracted to 1.57 Å resolution and belonged to the trigonal space group P3112, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 102.9, c = 136.5 Å. The asymmetric unit contained two monomers, with a corresponding VM of 2.3 Å(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 46.9%.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a heme-dependent and pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent protein that controls the flux of sulfur from methionine to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, taurine, and H2S. Deficiency of CBS activity causes homocystinuria, the most frequent disorder of sulfur amino acid metabolism. In contrast to CBSs from lower organisms, human CBS (hCBS) is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which binds to the regulatory domain and triggers a conformational change that allows the protein to progress from the basal toward the activated state. The structural basis of the underlying molecular mechanism has remained elusive so far. Here, we present the structure of hCBS with bound AdoMet, revealing the activated conformation of the human enzyme. Binding of AdoMet triggers a conformational change in the Bateman module of the regulatory domain that favors its association with a Bateman module of the complementary subunit to form an antiparallel CBS module. Such an arrangement is very similar to that found in the constitutively activated insect CBS. In the presence of AdoMet, the autoinhibition exerted by the regulatory region is eliminated, allowing for improved access of substrates to the catalytic pocket. Based on the availability of both the basal and the activated structures, we discuss the mechanism of hCBS activation by AdoMet and the properties of the AdoMet binding site, as well as the responsiveness of the enzyme to its allosteric regulator. The structure described herein paves the way for the rational design of compounds modulating hCBS activity and thus transsulfuration, redox status, and H2S biogenesis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) functions as a coenzyme in many cellular processes including one-carbon metabolism and the interconversion and catabolism of amino acids. PLP-dependent enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, function in transsulfuration but also have been implicated in the production of the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concurrent with the formation of the biomarkers lanthionine and homolanthionine.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if H2S production and concurrent biomarker production is affected by vitamin B-6 restriction in a cell culture model.METHODS: We used cultured human hepatoma cells and evaluated static intracellular profiles of amino acids and in vivo kinetics of H2S biomarker formation. Cells were cultured for 6 wk in media containing concentrations of pyridoxal that represented severe vitamin B-6 deficiency (15 nmol/L pyridoxal), marginal deficiency (56 nmol/L pyridoxal), adequacy (210 nmol/L pyridoxal), and standard medium formulation providing a supraphysiologic pyridoxal concentration (1800 nmol/L pyridoxal).RESULTS: Intracellular concentrations of lanthionine and homolanthionine in cells cultured at 15 nmol/L pyridoxal were 50% lower (P &lt; 0.002) and 47% lower (P &lt; 0.0255), respectively, than observed in cells cultured at 1800 nmol/L pyridoxal. Extracellular homocysteine and cysteine were 58% and 46% higher, respectively, in severely deficient cells than in adequate cells (P &lt; 0.002). Fractional synthesis rates of lanthionine (P &lt; 0.01) and homolanthionine (P &lt; 0.006) were lower at 15 and 56 nmol/L pyridoxal than at both higher pyridoxal concentrations. The rate of homocysteine remethylation and the fractional rate of homocysteine production from methionine were not affected by vitamin B-6 restriction. In vitro studies of cell lysates using direct measurement of H2S also had a reduced extent of H2S production in the 2 lower vitamin B-6 conditions.CONCLUSION: In view of the physiologic roles of H2S, these results suggest a mechanism that may be involved in the association between human vitamin B-6 inadequacy and its effects on human health.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a key regulator of sulfur amino acid metabolism diverting homocysteine, a toxic intermediate of the methionine cycle, via the transsulfuration pathway to the biosynthesis of cysteine. Although the pathway itself is well conserved among eukaryotes, properties of eukaryotic CBS enzymes vary greatly. Here we present a side-by-side biochemical and biophysical comparison of human (hCBS), fruit fly (dCBS) and yeast (yCBS) enzymes. Preparation and characterization of the full-length and truncated enzymes, lacking the regulatory domains, suggested that eukaryotic CBS exists in one of at least two significantly different conformations impacting the enzyme’s catalytic activity, oligomeric status and regulation. Truncation of hCBS and yCBS, but not dCBS, resulted in enzyme activation and formation of dimers compared to native tetramers. The dCBS and yCBS are not regulated by the allosteric activator of hCBS, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet); however, they have significantly higher specific activities in the canonical as well as alternative reactions compared to hCBS. Unlike yCBS, the heme-containing dCBS and hCBS showed increased thermal stability and retention of the enzyme’s catalytic activity. The mass-spectrometry analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry showed clear presence and binding of AdoMet to yCBS and hCBS, but not dCBS. However, the role of AdoMet binding to yCBS remains unclear, unlike its role in hCBS. This study provides valuable information for understanding the complexity of the domain organization, catalytic specificity and regulation among eukaryotic CBS enzymes.</p>

<p>Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid derived from the methionine metabolism, is located at the branch point of two pathways of the methionine cycle, i.e. remethylation and transsulfuration. Gene abnormalities in the enzymes catalyzing reactions in both pathways lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk for congenital disorders, including neural tube closure defects, heart defects, cleft lip/palate, Down syndrome, and multi-system abnormalities in adults. Since hyperhomocysteinemia is known to affect the extent of DNA methylation, it is likely that abnormal DNA methylation during embryogenesis, may be a pathogenic factor for these congenital disorders. In this review we highlight the importance of homocysteinemia by describing the genes encoding for enzymes of homocysteine metabolism relevant to the clinical practice, especially cystathionine-ß-synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations, and the impairment of related metabolites levels. Moreover, a possible correlation between hyperhomocysteine and congenital disorders through the involvement of abnormal DNA methylation during embryogenesis is discussed. Finally, the relevance of present and future diagnostic tools such as tandem mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing in newborn screening is highlighted.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Disorders of homocysteine and B-vitamin metabolism represent a significant problem in clinical practice. Establishing the diagnosis requires specialized tests with demanding preanalytical requirements. To advance the detection of patients with these disorders, we developed a method for the simultaneous determination of cystathionine (Cysta), methionine (Met) and total homocysteine (tHcy) in dried blood spots (DBSs).METHODS: A punch from a DBS sample was mixed with a solution of isotopically labeled internal standards, and analytes were extracted using methanol/0.1% formic acid/0.5mol/L dithiothreitol. The extract was injected into an LC-MS/MS system operating in MRM mode.RESULTS: The analytical performance of the method employing DBS is adequate for its purpose and the type of sample. Compared with Cysta, tHcy and Met plasma levels, our method exhibited a negative bias between -3.8% and -42.2% due to the lower concentrations of these analytes in erythrocytes. The tHcy level and the Met/Cysta ratio in DBS enabled the clear detection of 12 patients with disorders of transsulfuration and with genetic and nutritional remethylation defects.CONCLUSIONS: The ease of collecting and transporting DBS samples may advance diagnostic procedures in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and thromboembolism. Consequently, this approach may facilitate detection and simplify the monitoring of patients with homocystinuria.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important biological signaling agent that exerts action on numerous (patho)physiological processes. Once generated, H2S can be oxidized to generate reductant-labile sulfane sulfur pools, which include hydrodisulfides/persulfides. Despite the importance of hydrodisulfides in H2S storage and signaling, little is known about the physical properties or chemical reactivity of these compounds. We report here the synthesis, isolation, and characterization (NMR, IR, Raman, HRMS, X-ray) of a small-molecule hydrodisulfide and highlight its reactivity with reductants, nucleophiles, electrophiles, acids, and bases. Our experimental results establish that hydrodisulfides release H2S upon reduction and that deprotonation results in disproportionation to the parent thiol and S(0), thus providing a mechanism for transsulfuration in the sulfane sulfur pool.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non-protein amino acid derived from dietary methionine. High levels of Hcy, known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is known to cause vascular complications. In the mammalian tissue, Hcy is metabolized by transsulfuration enzymes to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S, a pungent smelling gas was previously known for its toxic effects in the central nervous system, recent studies however has revealed protective effects in a variety of diseases including hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and renal disease progression and failure. Interestingly, under stress conditions including hypoxia, H2S can reduce metabolic demand and also act as a substrate for ATP production. This review highlights some of the recent advances in H2S research as a potential therapeutic agent targeting renovascular diseases associated with HHcy.</p>

<p>In yeast and filamentous fungi, sulfide can be condensed either with O-acetylhomoserine to generate homocysteine, the precursor of methionine, or with O-acetylserine to directly generate cysteine. The resulting homocysteine and cysteine can be interconverted through transsulfuration pathway. Here, we systematically analyzed the sulfur metabolic pathway of the thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, which has attracted much attention as an industrial yeast strain for various biotechnological applications. Quite interestingly, the detailed sulfur metabolic pathway of H. polymorpha, which was reconstructed based on combined analyses of the genome sequences and validation by systematic gene deletion experiments, revealed the absence of de novo synthesis of homocysteine from inorganic sulfur in this yeast. Thus, the direct biosynthesis of cysteine from sulfide is the only pathway of synthesizing sulfur amino acids from inorganic sulfur in H. polymorpha, despite the presence of both directions of transsulfuration pathway Moreover, only cysteine, but no other sulfur amino acid, was able to repress the expression of a subset of sulfur genes, suggesting its central and exclusive role in the control of H. polymorpha sulfur metabolism. 35S-Cys was more efficiently incorporated into intracellular sulfur compounds such as glutathione than 35S-Met in H. polymorpha, further supporting the cysteine-centered sulfur pathway. This is the first report on the novel features of H. polymorpha sulfur metabolic pathway, which are noticeably distinct from those of other yeast and filamentous fungal species.</p>

<p>Selenium is an essential trace element and mediates its functions via various selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases or thioredoxin reductases. A suboptimal selenium supply causes metabolic disturbances and is associated with an increased risk to develop different disorders, including cancer or cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to assess the impact of a suboptimal selenium status on the hepatic metabolome of male mice analyzed by a targeted liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and a method based on non-targeted gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry. Feeding animals a diet with about half of the recommended selenium content supplied as selenomethionine caused liver glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase activities to decline and lipid peroxidation to increase. Serum T3 thyroid hormone concentration also declined via a reduced hepatic deiodinase activity. Metabolite profiling revealed predominantly changes in cysteine and carbon-1 metabolism as well as in selected lipid subclasses. In particular the concentrations of palmitoylcarnitines and oleoylcarnitines (C18:1 and C16:1) and various phosphatidylcholine species containing saturated fatty acids were elevated. Increased taurine levels suggested an enhanced cysteine flux through the salvage pathway whereas increased homocysteine levels appeared to be a consequence of a massive down-regulation of cystathionine ß lyase (cystathionine ß synthase) and a reduced flux through the transsulfuration pathway. The findings demonstrate that a suboptimal selenium status causes alterations in lipid and carbon-1 metabolism in mouse liver. These changes may contribute to the development of diseases associated with a suboptimal selenium status.</p>

<p>The development of congenital heart defects (CHDs) involves a complex interplay between genetic variants, epigenetic variants, and environmental exposures. Previous studies have suggested that susceptibility to CHDs is associated with maternal genotypes, fetal genotypes, and maternal-fetal genotype (MFG) interactions. We conducted a haplotype-based genetic association study of obstructive heart defects (OHDs), aiming to detect the genetic effects of 877 SNPs involved in the homocysteine, folate, and transsulfuration pathways. Genotypes were available for 285 mother-offspring pairs with OHD-affected pregnancies and 868 mother-offspring pairs with unaffected pregnancies. A penalized logistic regression model was applied with an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), which dissects the maternal effect, fetal effect, and MFG interaction effects associated with OHDs. By examining the association between 140 haplotype blocks, we identified 9 blocks that are potentially associated with OHD occurrence. Four haplotype blocks, located in genes MGMT, MTHFS, CBS, and DNMT3L, were statistically significant using a Bayesian false-discovery probability threshold of 0.8. Two blocks in MGMT and MTHFS appear to have significant fetal effects, while the CBS and DNMT3L genes may have significant MFG interaction effects.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient homocystinuria (HCU) is a serious life-threatening inborn error of sulfur metabolism with poorly understood pathogenic mechanisms. We investigated the effect of HCU on hepatic cysteine oxidation in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) protein levels were 90% repressed without any change in mRNA levels. Cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) was induced at both the mRNA (8-fold) and protein (15-fold) levels. Cysteine supplementation normalized CDO protein levels without reversing the induction of CSAD. Regulatory changes in CDO and CSAD expression were proportional to homocysteine elevation, indicating a possible threshold effect. Hepatic and blood taurine levels in HCU animals were decreased by 21 and 35%, respectively, and normalized by cysteine supplementation. Expression of the cytoplasmic (GOT1) and mitochondrial (GOT2) isoforms of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase were repressed in HCU animals by 86 and 30%, respectively. HCU induced regulatory changes in CSAD, CDO, and GOT1 expression were normalized by taurine supplementation, indicating that cysteine is not the only sulfur compound that regulates hepatic cysteine oxidation. Collectively, our results indicate that HCU induces significant alterations of sulfur metabolism with the potential to contribute to pathogenesis and that cysteine and taurine have the potential to serve as adjunctive treatments in this disease.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is regarded as the third endogenous gaseous signaling molecule. Cystathioine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), one of the three enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway, is responsible for the production of endogenous H2S. The H2S/CSE signaling pathway is involved in the inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of the binding site (on the CSE promoter) for the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B, on the transcriptional regulation of the CSE gene in mammalian cells treated with LPS. For this purpose, HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were transfected with 5 µg pGL4.12-KM1478 or 5 µg pGL4.12-KM1478m (mutant) together with the pRL-CMV control vector (0.032 µg for the HEK-293 cells, 0.0032 µg for the COS-7 cells). Subsequently, the cells were treated with LPS for 6 h. The expression of CSE was measured by RT-qPCR. cDNA pooled from J774.1A and RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS for 6 h was used to estimate the quantity of the transcripts. Our results revealed that LPS markedly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of the CSE gene in the J774.1A and RAW264.7 cells following treatment with LPS for 6 h. In addition, we found that the GGGACATTCC DNA sequence on the promoter of the CSE gene was closely associated with the transcriptional regulation of the CSE gene in the HEK-293 and COS-7 cells treated with LPS. Taken together, our data suggest that the NF-<U+03BA>B binding site on CSE promoter is critical for LPS-induced CSE expression in mammalian cells.</p>

<p>Low vitamin B-6 nutritional status is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) serves as a coenzyme in many cellular processes, including several reactions in one-carbon (1C) metabolism and the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine catabolism. To assess the effect of vitamin B-6 deficiency on these processes and associated pathways, we conducted quantitative analysis of 1C metabolites including tetrahydrofolate species in HepG2 cells cultured in various concentrations of pyridoxal. These results were compared with predictions of a mathematical model of 1C metabolism simulating effects of vitamin B-6 deficiency. In cells cultured in vitamin B-6-deficient medium (25 or 35 nmol/l pyridoxal), we observed &gt;200% higher concentrations of betaine (P &lt; 0.05) and creatinine (P &lt; 0.05) and &gt;60% lower concentrations of creatine (P &lt; 0.05) and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (P &lt; 0.05) compared with cells cultured in medium containing intermediate (65 nmol/l) or the supraphysiological 2,015 nmol/l pyridoxal. Cystathionine, cysteine, glutathione, and cysteinylglycine, which are components of the transsulfuration pathway and subsequent reactions, exhibited greater concentrations at the two lower vitamin B-6 concentrations. Partial least squares discriminant analysis showed differences in overall profiles between cells cultured in 25 and 35 nmol/l pyridoxal vs. those in 65 and 2,015 nmol/l pyridoxal. Mathematical model predictions aligned with analytically derived results. These data reveal pronounced effects of vitamin B-6 deficiency on 1C-related metabolites, including previously unexpected secondary effects on creatine. These results complement metabolomic studies in humans demonstrating extended metabolic effects of vitamin B-6 insufficiency.</p>

<p>Assessment of the network of toxicity pathways by Omics technologies and bioinformatic data processing paves the road toward a new toxicology for the twenty-first century. Especially, the upstream network of responses, taking place in toxicant-treated cells before a point of no return is reached, is still little explored. We studied the effects of the model neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) by a combined metabolomics (mass spectrometry) and transcriptomics (microarrays and deep sequencing) approach to provide unbiased data on earliest cellular adaptations to stress. Neural precursor cells (LUHMES) were differentiated to homogeneous cultures of fully postmitotic human dopaminergic neurons, and then exposed to the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor MPP(+) (5 µM). At 18-24 h after treatment, intracellular ATP and mitochondrial integrity were still close to control levels, but pronounced transcriptome and metabolome changes were seen. Data on altered glucose flux, depletion of phosphocreatine and oxidative stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide formation) confirmed the validity of the approach. New findings were related to nuclear paraspeckle depletion, as well as an early activation of branches of the transsulfuration pathway to increase glutathione. Bioinformatic analysis of our data identified the transcription factor ATF-4 as an upstream regulator of early responses. Findings on this signaling pathway and on adaptive increases of glutathione production were confirmed biochemically. Metabolic and transcriptional profiling contributed complementary information on multiple primary and secondary changes that contribute to the cellular response to MPP(+). Thus, combined ‘Omics’ analysis is a new unbiased approach to unravel earliest metabolic changes, whose balance decides on the final cell fate.</p>

<p>Human cystathionine ß-synthase (hCBS) is a key enzyme of sulfur amino acid metabolism, controlling the commitment of homocysteine to the transsulfuration pathway and antioxidant defense. Mutations in hCBS cause inherited homocystinuria (HCU), a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by accumulation of toxic homocysteine in blood and urine. hCBS is a complex multidomain and oligomeric protein whose activity and stability are independently regulated by the binding of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) to two different types of sites at its C-terminal regulatory domain. Here we study the role of surface electrostatics on the complex regulation and stability of hCBS using biophysical and biochemical procedures. We show that the kinetic stability of the catalytic and regulatory domains is significantly affected by the modulation of surface electrostatics through noticeable structural and energetic changes along their denaturation pathways. We also show that surface electrostatics strongly affect SAM binding properties to those sites responsible for either enzyme activation or kinetic stabilization. Our results provide new insight into the regulation of hCBS activity and stability in vivo with implications for understanding HCU as a conformational disease. We also lend experimental support to the role of electrostatic interactions in the recently proposed binding modes of SAM leading to hCBS activation and kinetic stabilization.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions such as protein biosynthesis, methylation, and polyamine and glutathione syntheses. In trypanosomatids, glutathione is conjugated with spermidine to form the specific antioxidant thiol trypanothione (T[SH]2) that plays a central role in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and providing defence against oxidative stress.METHODS: We cloned and characterised genes coding for a cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS) and cysteine synthase (CS), key enzymes of the transsulfuration and assimilatory pathways, respectively, from the hemoflagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma rangeli.RESULTS: Our results show that T. rangeli CßS (TrCßS), similar to its homologs in T. cruzi, contains the catalytic domain essential for enzymatic activity. Unlike the enzymes in bacteria, plants, and other parasites, T. rangeli CS lacks two of the four lysine residues (Lys26 and Lys184) required for activity. Enzymatic studies using T. rangeli extracts confirmed the absence of CS activity but confirmed the expression of an active CßS. Moreover, CßS biochemical assays revealed that the T. rangeli CßS enzyme also has serine sulfhydrylase activity.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the RTS pathway is active in T. rangeli, suggesting that this may be the only pathway for cysteine biosynthesis in this parasite. In this sense, the RTS pathway appears to have an important functional role during the insect stage of the life cycle of this protozoan parasite.</p>

<p>The kidney is one of the major loci for the expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). While CBS-deficient (Cbs(-/-)) mice display homocysteinemia/methioninemia and severe growth retardation, and rarely survive beyond the first 4 wk, CTH-deficient (Cth(-/-)) mice show homocysteinemia/cystathioninemia but develop with no apparent abnormality. This study examined renal amino acid reabsorption in those mice. Although both 2-wk-old Cbs(-/-) and Cth(-/-) mice had normal renal architecture, their serum/urinary amino acid profiles largely differed from wild-type mice. The most striking feature was marked accumulation of Met and cystathionine in serum/urine/kidney samples of Cbs(-/-) and Cth(-/-) mice, respectively. Levels of some neutral amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile, and Tyr) that were not elevated in Cbs(-/-) serum were highly elevated in Cbs(-/-) urine, and urinary excretion of other neutral amino acids (except Met) was much higher than expected from their serum levels, demonstrating neutral aminoaciduria in Cbs(-/-) (not Cth(-/-)) mice. Because the bulk of neutral amino acids is absorbed via a B(0)AT1 transporter and Met has the highest substrate affinity for B(0)AT1 than other neutral amino acids, hypermethioninemia may cause hyperexcretion of neutral amino acids.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in severe psychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia). Here, we provide evidence of how the effects of oxidative stress on fatty acid (FA) and one-carbon (1-C) cycle metabolism, which may initially represent adaptive responses, might underlie comorbidity between CVD and psychiatric disorders.METHOD: We conducted a literature search and integrated data in a narrative review.RESULTS: Oxidative stress, mainly generated in mitochondria, is implicated in both psychiatric and cardiovascular pathophysiology. Oxidative stress affects the intrinsically linked FA and 1-C cycle metabolism: FAs decrease in chain length and unsaturation (particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated FAs), and lipid peroxidation products increase; the 1-C cycle shifts from the methylation to transsulfuration pathway (lower folate and higher homocysteine and antioxidant glutathione). Interestingly, corresponding alterations were reported in psychiatric disorders and CVD. Potential mechanisms through which FA and 1-C cycle metabolism may be involved in brain (neurocognition, mood regulation) and cardiovascular system functioning (inflammation, thrombosis) include membrane peroxidizability and fluidity, eicosanoid synthesis, neuroprotection and epigenetics.CONCLUSION: While oxidative-stress-induced alterations in FA and 1-C metabolism may initially enhance oxidative stress resistance, persisting chronically, they may cause damage possibly underlying (co-occurrence of) psychiatric disorders and CVD. This might have implications for research into diagnosis and (preventive) treatment of (CVD in) psychiatric patients.</p>

<p>Freshwater invertebrates are often exposed to metal contamination, and changes in gene expression patterns can help understand mechanisms underlying toxicity and act as pollutant-specific biomarkers. In this study the expressions of genes involved in cysteine metabolism are characterized in the midge Chironomus tepperi during exposures to sublethal concentrations of cadmium and copper. These metals altered gene expression of the cysteine metabolism differently. Both metals decreased S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase expression and did not change the expression of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Cadmium exposure likely increased cystathionine production by up-regulating cystathionine-ß-synthase (CßS) expression, while maintaining control level cysteine production via cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (C<U+03B3>L) expression. Conversely, copper down-regulated CßS expression and up-regulated C<U+03B3>L expression, which in turn could diminish cystathionine to favor cysteine production. Both metals up-regulated glutathione related expression (<U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthase and glutathione synthetase). Only cadmium up-regulated metallothionein expression and glutathione S-transferase d1 expression was up-regulated only by copper exposure. These different transcription responses of genes involved in cysteine metabolism in C. tepperi point to metal-specific detoxification pathways and suggest that the transsulfuration pathway could provide biomarkers for identifying specific metals.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine, with the release of water. In humans, deficiency in CBS activity is the most common cause of hyperhomocysteinaemia and homocystinuria. More than 160 pathogenic mutations in the human CBS gene have been described to date. Here, the purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the catalytic core of CBS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScCBS) is described which, in contrast to other eukaryotic CBSs, lacks the N-terminal haem-binding domain and is considered to be a useful model for investigation of the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-mediated reactions of human CBS (hCBS). The purified protein yielded two different crystal forms belonging to space groups P41212 and P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 72.390, c = 386.794 Å and a = 58.156, b = 89.988, c = 121.687 Å, respectively. Diffraction data were collected to 2.7 and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively, using synchrotron radiation. Preliminary analysis of the X-ray data suggests the presence of ScCBS homodimers in both types of crystals.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: We investigated the association between conotruncal heart defects (CTDs) and maternal and fetal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 60 genes in the folate, homocysteine, and transsulfuration pathways. We also investigated whether periconceptional maternal folic acid supplementation modified associations between CTDs and SNPsMETHODS: Participants were enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study between 1997 and 2008. DNA samples from 616 case-parental triads affected by CTDs and 1645 control-parental triads were genotyped using an Illumina® Golden Gate custom SNP panel. A hybrid design analysis, optimizing data from case and control trios, was used to identify maternal and fetal SNPs associated with CTDsRESULTS: Among 921 SNPs, 17 maternal and 17 fetal SNPs had a Bayesian false-discovery probability of &lt;0.8. Ten of the 17 maternal SNPs and 2 of the 17 fetal SNPs were found within the glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC) gene. Fetal SNPs with the lowest Bayesian false-discovery probability (rs2612101, rs2847607, rs2847326, rs2847324) were found within the thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) gene. Additional analyses indicated that the risk of CTDs associated with candidate SNPs was modified by periconceptional folic acid supplementation. Nineteen maternal and nine fetal SNPs had a Bayesian false-discovery probability &lt;0.8 for gene-by-environment (G × E) interactions with maternal folic acid supplementation.CONCLUSION: These results support previous studies suggesting that maternal and fetal SNPs within folate, homocysteine, and transsulfuration pathways are associated with CTD risk. Maternal use of supplements containing folic acid may modify the impact of SNPs on the developing heart.</p>

<p>An elevated concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid is considered to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Homocysteine (Hcy) levels are influenced by folate concentrations and numerous genetic factors through the folate cycle, however, their role in the pathogenesis of PD remains controversial. Hcy exerts a neurotoxic action and may participate in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration, such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, calcium accumulation, and apoptosis. Elevated Hcy levels can lead to prooxidative activity, most probably through direct interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and sensitization of dopaminergic neurons to age-related dysfunction and death. Several studies have shown that higher concentration of Hcy in PD is related to long-term administration of levodopa (L-dopa). An elevation of plasma tHcy levels can also reflect deficiencies of cofactors in remethylation of Hcy to methionine (Met) (folates and vitamin B12) and in its transsulfuration to cysteine (Cys) (vitamin B6). It is believed that the increase in the concentration of Hcy in PD can affect genetic polymorphisms of the folate metabolic pathway genes, such as MTHFR (C677T, A1298C and G1793A), MTR (A2756G), and MTHFD1 (G1958A), whose frequencies tend to increase in PD patients, as well as the reduced concentration of B vitamins. In PD, increased levels of Hcy may lead to dementia, depression and progression of the disease.</p>

<p>Microbial organic sulfur mineralization to sulfate in terrestrial systems is poorly understood. The process is often missing in published sulfur cycle models. Studies on microbial sulfur cycling have been mostly centered on transformations of inorganic sulfur, mainly on sulfate-reducing and inorganic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Nevertheless, organic sulfur constitutes most sulfur in soils. Recent reports demonstrate that the mobilization of organic-bound-sulfur as sulfate in terrestrial environments occurs preferentially under high temperatures and thermophilic Firmicutes bacteria play a major role in the process, carrying out dissimilative organic-sulfur oxidation. So far, the determinant metabolic reactions of such activity have not been evaluated. Here, in silico analysis was performed on the genomes of sulfate-producing thermophilic genera and mesophilic low-sulfate producers, revealing that highest sulfate production is related to the simultaneous presence of metabolic pathways leading to sulfite synthesis, similar to the ones found in mammalian cells. Those pathways include reverse transsulfuration reactions (tightly associated with methionine cycling), and the presence of aspartate aminotransferases (ATs) with the potential of 3-sulfinoalanine AT and cysteine AT activity, which ultimately leads to sulfite production. Sulfite is oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase, this enzyme is determinant in sulfate synthesis, and it is absent in many mesophiles.</p>

<p>Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is present in every cell of the body. It represents a central systems biology hub that reverberates into countless other pathways with more specialized roles in specialized cell types throughout the body. I have spent 25 years of research on this core biochemical pathway with several unanticipated iterations that led me from Down syndrome to congenital heart defects to leukemia and finally to autism about 12 years ago. Figure 1 provides an overview of the three interdependent pathways involved in folate-dependent methionine “transmethylation” and “transsulfuration.” Methionine is necessary for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl donor for all cellular methylation reactions. It is also the major precursor for cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid for glutathione synthesis linking transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways. Methionine levels can be negatively affected by genetic and environmental factors that reduce folate availability and/or oxidative inhibition of the methionine synthase enzyme. Because these three metabolic pathways are mutually interdependent, genetic or environmental perturbation of folate or methionine metabolism will indirectly impact glutathione synthesis, and conversely, alterations in glutathione synthesis will alter flux through pathways of folate and methionine metabolism. This interdependency translates into broader impact on essential cellular functions.</p>

<p>Leishmania parasites seem capable of producing cysteine by de novo biosynthesis, similarly to bacteria, some pathogenic protists, and plants. In Leishmania spp., cysteine synthase (CS) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) are expected to participate in this metabolic process. Moreover, the reverse transsulfuration pathway (RTP) is also predicted to be operative in this trypanosomatid because CBS also catalyzes the condensation of serine with homocysteine, and a gene encoding a putative cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) is present in all the sequenced genomes. Our results show that indeed, Leishmania major CGL is able to rescue the wild-type phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae CGL-null mutant and is susceptible to inhibition by an irreversible CGL inhibitor, DL-propargylglycine (PAG). In Leishmania promastigotes, CGL and CS are cytosolic enzymes. The coexistence of de novo synthesis with the RTP is extremely rare in most living organisms; however, despite this potentially high redundancy in cysteine production, PAG arrests the proliferation of L. major promastigotes with an IC50 of approximately 65 µM. These findings raise new questions regarding the biological role of CGL in these pathogens and indicate the need for understanding the molecular mechanism of PAG action in vivo to identify the potential targets affected by this drug.</p>

<p>Earlier studies have shown that betaine administration may modulate the metabolism of sulfur amino acids in the liver. In this study, we determined the changes in the metabolomics of sulfur-containing substances induced by betaine in the kidney, the other major organ actively involved in the transsulfuration reactions. Male rats received betaine (1%) in drinking water for 2 weeks before killing. Betaine intake did not affect betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase activity or its protein expression in the renal tissue. Expression of methionine synthase was also unchanged. However, methionine levels were increased significantly both in plasma and kidney. Renal methionine adenosyltransferase activity and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations were increased, but there were no changes in S-adenosylhomocysteine, homocysteine, cysteine levels or cystathionine ß-synthase expression. <U+03B3>-Glutamylcysteine synthetase expression or glutathione levels were not altered, but cysteine dioxygenase and taurine levels were decreased significantly. In contrast, betaine administration induced cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase and its metabolic product, hypotaurine. These results indicate that the metabolomics of sulfur-containing substances in the kidney is altered extensively by betaine, although the renal capacity for methionine synthesis is unresponsive to this substance unlike that of the liver. It is suggested that the increased methionine availability due to an enhancement of its uptake from plasma may account for the alterations in the metabolomics of sulfur-containing substances in the kidney. Further studies need to be conducted to clarify the physiological/pharmacological significance of these findings.</p>

<p>Melanoma is a severe type of skin cancer with a high metastasis potential and poor survival rates once metastasized. The causes of melanoma formation are multifactorial and not fully understood. Several signaling cascades such as the RAS/RAF/ERK1/2 pathway, the PI3K/AKT pathway, RAC1 and NF-<U+03BA>B are involved in melanoma initiation and progression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are induced by these signal transduction cascades, and they play a fundamental role in melanomagenic processes. Cells derived from the melanocytic lineage are particularly sensitive to an increase in ROS, and thus, melanoma cells rely on efficient antioxidant measures. This review summarizes the causes and consequences of ROS generation in melanocytes and melanoma and discusses the potential of pro-oxidant therapy in melanoma treatment.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Elevated homocysteine is a cardiovascular risk factor in hyperlipidemia. Transsulfuration pathway provides an endogenous pathway for homocysteine conversion to antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Salvianolic acid A (Sal A) contains two molecules of caffeic acid and one molecule of danshensu that is capable of enhancing homocysteine transsulfuration, which led to the hypothesis that Sal A has activatory effect on transsulfuration pathway and this effect may have beneficial effects on both homocysteine and redox status in hyperlipidemia.METHODS AND RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, we developed a rat model of hyperlipidemia induced by high-fat diet for 16 weeks, during which rats were treated with 1 mg/kg salvianolic acid A (Sal A) for the final 4 weeks. Activities of key enzymes and metabolite profiling in the transsulfuration pathway revealed that hyperlipidemia led to elevated plasma homocysteine levels after 16-week dietary treatment, which was associated with reduced activities of homocysteine transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). The impaired transsulfuration pathway prevented homocysteine transsulfuration to cysteine, resulting in cysteine deficiency and subsequent reduction in GSH pool size. The redox status was altered in the setting of hyperlipidemia as indicated by GSH/GSSG ratio. Sal A treatment increased hepatic CBS and CSE activities, which was associated with reduced accumulation in circulating homocysteine levels and attenuated decline in hepatic cysteine content in hyperlipidemic rats. Sal A also led to an increase in GSH pool size, which subsequently caused a restored GSH/GSSG ratio. The activatory effect of Sal A on CBS was also observed in normal rats and in in vitro experiment.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that activation of transsulfuration pathway by Sal A is a promising homocysteine-lowering approach that has beneficial effects on redox homeostasis in hyperlipidemic settings.</p>

<p>Cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-cystathionine (l-Cth), producing l-cysteine (l-Cys), a-ketobutyrate and ammonia, in the second step of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which converts l-homocysteine (l-Hcys) to l-Cys. Site-directed variants substituting residues E48 and E333 with alanine, aspartate and glutamine were characterized to probe the roles of these acidic residues, conserved in fungal and mammalian CGL sequences, in the active-site of CGL from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yCGL). The pH optimum of variants containing the alanine or glutamine substitutions of E333 is increased by 0.4-1.2 pH units, likely due to repositioning of the cofactor and modification of the pKa of the pyridinium nitrogen. The pH profile of yCGL-E48A/E333A resembles that of Escherichia coli cystathionine ß-lyase. The effect of substituting E48, E333 or both residues is the 1.3-3, 26-58 and 124-568-fold reduction, respectively, of the catalytic efficiency of l-Cth hydrolysis. The Km(l-Cth) of E333 substitution variants is increased ~17-fold, while Km(l-OAS) is within 2.5-fold of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that residue E333 interacts with the distal amine moiety of l-Cth, which is not present in the alternative substrate O-acetyl-l-serine. The catalytic efficiency of yCGL for a,<U+03B3>-elimination of O-succinyl-l-homoserine (kcat/Km(l-OSHS)=7±2), which possesses a distal carboxylate, but lacks an amino group, is 300-fold lower than that of the physiological l-Cth substrate (kcat/Km(l-Cth)=2100±100) and 260-fold higher than that of l-Hcys (kcat/Km(l-Hcys)=0.027±0.005), which lacks both distal polar moieties. The results of this study suggest that the glutamate residue at position 333 is a determinant of specificity.</p>

<p>Phytochelatins are small cysteine-rich non-ribosomal peptides that chelate soft metal and metalloid ions, such as cadmium and arsenic. They are widely produced by plants and microbes; phytochelatin synthase genes are also present in animal species from several different phyla, but there is still little known about whether these genes are functional in animals, and if so, whether they are metal-responsive. We analysed phytochelatin production by direct chemical analysis in Lumbricus rubellus earthworms exposed to arsenic for a 28 day period, and found that arsenic clearly induced phytochelatin production in a dose-dependent manner. It was necessary to measure the phytochelatin metabolite concentrations directly, as there was no upregulation of phytochelatin synthase gene expression after 28 days: phytochelatin synthesis appears not to be transcriptionally regulated in animals. A further untargetted metabolomic analysis also found changes in metabolites associated with the transsulfuration pathway, which channels sulfur flux from methionine for phytochelatin synthesis. There was no evidence of biological transformation of arsenic (e.g. into methylated species) as a result of laboratory arsenic exposure. Finally, we compared wild populations of earthworms sampled from the field, and found that both arsenic-contaminated and cadmium-contaminated mine site worms had elevated phytochelatin concentrations.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is characterized by high rates of metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Many chemotherapeutic agents rely on the induction of oxidative stress to cause cancer cell death, thus targeting redox regulation is a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance.METHODS: We have used a tetracycline-inducible Ets-1 overexpression model derived from 2008 ovarian cancer cells in the present study. To examine the role of Ets-1 in glutathione regulation we have measured intracellular reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels, as well as glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. Glutathione synthesis was limited using transsulfuration or Sx(c)- pathway blocking agents, and glutamate release was measured to confirm Sx(c)- blockade. Cell viability following drug treatment was assessed via crystal violet assay. Oxidative stress was induced through glucose oxidase treatment, which produces hydrogen peroxide by glucose oxidation. The protein expressions of redox-related factors were measured through western blotting.RESULTS: Overexpression of Ets-1 was associated with decreased intracellular ROS, concomitantly with increased intracellular GSH, GPX antioxidant activity, and Sx(c)- transporter activity. Under basal conditions, inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway resulted in decreased GSH levels and GPX activity in all cell lines, whereas inhibition of Sx(c)- by sulfasalazine decreased GPX activity in Ets-1-expressing cells only. However, under oxidative stress the intracellular GSH levels decreased significantly in correlation with increased Ets-1 expression following sulfasalazine treatment.CONCLUSIONS: In this study we have identified a role for proto-oncogene Ets-1 in the regulation of intracellular glutathione levels, and examined the effects of the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine on glutathione depletion using an ovarian cancer cell model. The findings from this study show that Ets-1 mediates enhanced Sx(c)- activity to increase glutathione levels under oxidative stress, suggesting that Ets-1 could be a promising putative target to enhance conventional therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>The chemotherapeutic compound, cisplatin causes various kinds of DNA lesions but also triggers other pertubations, such as ER and oxidative stress. We and others have shown that treatment of pluripotent stem cells with cisplatin causes a plethora of transcriptional and post-translational alterations that, to a major extent, point to DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. The orchestrated DDR signaling network is important to arrest the cell cycle and repair the lesions or, in case of damage beyond repair, eliminate affected cells. Failure to properly balance the various aspects of the DDR in stem cells contributes to ageing and cancer. Here, we performed metabolic profiling by mass spectrometry of embryonic stem (ES) cells treated for different time periods with cisplatin. We then integrated metabolomics with transcriptomics analyses and connected cisplatin-regulated metabolites with regulated metabolic enzymes to identify enriched metabolic pathways. These included nucleotide metabolism, urea cycle and arginine and proline metabolism. Silencing of identified proline metabolic and catabolic enzymes indicated that altered proline metabolism serves as an adaptive, rather than a toxic response. A group of enriched metabolic pathways clustered around the metabolite S-adenosylmethionine, which is a hub for methylation and transsulfuration reactions and polyamine metabolism. Enzymes and metabolites with pro- or anti-oxidant functions were also enriched but enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species were not measured in cisplatin-treated ES cells. Lastly, a number of the differentially regulated metabolic enzymes were identified as target genes of the transcription factor p53, pointing to p53-mediated alterations in metabolism in response to genotoxic stress. Altogether, our findings reveal interconnecting metabolic pathways that are responsive to cisplatin and may serve as signaling modules in the DDR in pluripotent stem cells.</p>

<p>There is increasing recognition that the host response to critical illness includes derangement of multiple amino acid pathways, including amino acids (AAs) central to metabolism and immune, endothelial and neurological function. To characterise concentration changes of these plasma amino acid we report the development and validation of a method for the quantification of AAs in small volumes of plasma (50µL) using HPLC with simultaneous UV and fluorescence (FL) detection. Protein precipitation and pre-column derivatization with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC) is followed by reversed phase HPLC separation. Calibration curves were built with norleucine as an internal standard. Thirty-three (including the 20 proteinogenic) AAs, were selected as standards and their corresponding concentrations in the plasma of healthy human controls and patients with severe falciparum malaria were quantified. This method enables the detection of perturbations in arginine metabolism, aromatic amino acid pathways, methionine transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways and other metabolic pathways.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) controls the flux of sulfur from methionine to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, taurine, and H2S. CBS condenses serine and homocysteine to cystathionine with the help of three cofactors, heme, pyridoxal-5’-phosphate, and S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Inherited deficiency of CBS activity causes homocystinuria, the most frequent disorder of sulfur metabolism. We present the structure of the human enzyme, discuss the unique arrangement of the CBS domains in the C-terminal region, and propose how they interact with the catalytic core of the complementary subunit to regulate access to the catalytic site. This arrangement clearly contrasts with other proteins containing the CBS domain including the recent Drosophila melanogaster CBS structure. The absence of large conformational changes and the crystal structure of the partially activated pathogenic D444N mutant suggest that the rotation of CBS motifs and relaxation of loops delineating the entrance to the catalytic site represent the most likely molecular mechanism of CBS activation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Moreover, our data suggest how tetramers, the native quaternary structure of the mammalian CBS enzymes, are formed. Because of its central role in transsulfuration, redox status, and H2S biogenesis, CBS represents a very attractive therapeutic target. The availability of the structure will help us understand the pathogenicity of the numerous missense mutations causing inherited homocystinuria and will allow the rational design of compounds modulating CBS activity.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking (CS) is the primary cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Abundant clinical evidence suggests that CS is more harmful to women; however, the mechanisms responsible for these differences are not yet known. CS alters endothelial function, the redox state, inflammation, and global DNA methylation, which is associated with one-carbon metabolism and the transsulfuration pathway. However, it is not known whether the previously identified alterations are sex-gender related. Healthy adult men and oral contraceptive-free women with regular menstrual cycles were enrolled; women were examined during the follicular phase. Men had higher plasma levels of uric acid, total bilirubin, homocysteine, glutamylcysteine, total glutathione, cysteinylglycine; had more monocytes and released more TNF-alpha from human monocytes derived macrophages (hMDMs), but they had fewer platelets and lower levels of DNA methylation, and their hMDMs released less TNF-alpha after LPS stimulation. MDA, taurine, cysteine, arginine, ADMA, and SDMA were not different. CS decreased global DNA methylation more in women and increased the platelet, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts and the homocysteine, arginine, and ADMA levels only in women, whereas increased the neutrophil and eosinophil counts only in men. Additionally, CS reduced the sex-gender differences in total bilirubin, basal and LPS-induced TNF-alpha release, total glutathione, and glutamylcysteine, leaving unchanged cysteinylglycine, taurine, SDMA, MDA, and cysteine. These data suggest that cardiovascular risk factors seem to come earlier in young healthy female smokers than in young healthy male smokers, supporting the greater alarmism regarding the effects of CS in women and providing a basis for understanding the sex-gender differences. These results also suggest that cessation programs targeting women are needed.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-lyase (CBL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-cystathionine (l-Cth), producing l-homocysteine (l-Hcys), pyruvate and ammonia, in the second step of the transsulfuration pathway of bacteria and plants. A series of 17 site-directed variants of Escherichia coli CBL (eCBL) was constructed to probe the contributions of the six tryptophan residues (W131, W188, W230, W276, W300 and W340) to the fluorescence spectrum of eCBL and to assess their mutability and utility as conformational probes. The effects of these Trp<U+2192>Phe substitutions on kcat and Km(l)(-Cth) are less than 2-fold, with the exception of the 8-fold increase in Km(l)(-Cth) observed for eCBL-W340F. The midpoint of thermal denaturation, as monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy, is reduced 4.7°C by the W188F substitution while the targeted replacement of the other five tryptophans alter Tm by less than 1.7°C. The fluorescence spectrum of eCBL is dominated by W230 and the contribution of W340, situated in the active site, is minor. The observed 5-fold increase in the 336 nm fluorescence emission of W188 between 0 and 2M urea, suggests a conformational change at the domain interface. Residues W188 and W340, conserved in proteobacterial CBL enzymes, are situated at the core of the domain interface that forms the active-site cleft. The results of this study suggest that W188 is a useful probe of subtle conformational changes at the domain interface and active site.</p>

<p>Suboptimal vitamin B-6 status, as reflected by low plasma pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) concentration, is associated with increased risk of vascular disease. PLP plays many roles, including in one-carbon metabolism for the acquisition and transfer of carbon units and in the transsulfuration pathway. PLP also serves as a coenzyme in the catabolism of tryptophan. We hypothesize that the pattern of these metabolites can provide information reflecting the functional impact of marginal vitamin B-6 deficiency. We report here the concentration of major constituents of one-carbon metabolic processes and the tryptophan catabolic pathway in plasma from 23 healthy men and women before and after a 28-d controlled dietary vitamin B-6 restriction (&lt;0.35 mg/d). liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the compounds relevant to one-carbon metabolism showed that vitamin B-6 restriction yielded increased cystathionine (53% pre- and 76% postprandial; P &lt; 0.0001) and serine (12% preprandial; P &lt; 0.05), and lower creatine (40% pre- and postprandial; P &lt; 0.0001), creatinine (9% postprandial; P &lt; 0.05), and dimethylglycine (16% postprandial; P &lt; 0.05) relative to the vitamin B-6-adequate state. In the tryptophan pathway, vitamin B-6 restriction yielded lower kynurenic acid (22% pre- and 20% postprandial; P &lt; 0.01) and higher 3-hydroxykynurenine (39% pre- and 34% postprandial; P &lt; 0.01). Multivariate ANOVA analysis showed a significant global effect of vitamin B-6 restriction and multilevel partial least squares-discriminant analysis supported this conclusion. Thus, plasma concentrations of creatine, cystathionine, kynurenic acid, and 3-hydroxykynurenine jointly reveal effects of vitamin B-6 restriction on the profiles of one-carbon and tryptophan metabolites and serve as biomarkers of functional effects of marginal vitamin B-6 deficiency.</p>

<p>The symbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola lacks key genes in the biosynthesis of five essential amino acids (EAAs), and yet its animal hosts (aphids) depend on the symbiosis for the synthesis of these EAAs (isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and valine). We tested the hypothesis, derived from genome annotation, that the missing Buchnera reactions are mediated by host enzymes, with the exchange of metabolic intermediates between the partners. The specialized host cells bearing Buchnera were separated into a Buchnera fraction and a Buchnera-free host cell fraction (HF). Addition of HF to isolated Buchnera preparations significantly increased the production of leucine and phenylalanine, and recombinant enzymes mediating the final reactions in branched-chain amino acid and phenylalanine synthesis rescued the production of these EAAs by Buchnera preparations without HF. The likely precursors for the missing proximal reactions in isoleucine and methionine synthesis were identified, and they differed from predictions based on genome annotations: synthesis of 2-oxobutanoate, the aphid-derived precursor of isoleucine synthesis, was stimulated by homoserine and not threonine via threonine dehydratase, and production of the homocysteine precursor of methionine was driven by cystathionine, not cysteine, via reversal of the transsulfuration pathway. The evolution of shared metabolic pathways in this symbiosis can be attributed to host compensation for genomic deterioration in the symbiont, involving changes in host gene expression networks to recruit specific enzymes to the host cell.</p>

<p>One-carbon metabolism, or methyl transfer, is critical for metabolism in all cells, is involved in the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, in the methylation of numerous substrates, proteins, DNA and RNA, and in the expression of a number of genes. Serine is the primary endogenous methyl donor to the one carbon pool. Perturbations in methyl transfer due to nutrient and hormonal changes can have profound effect on cell function, growth and proliferation. It is postulated that at critical stages in development, nutrient and environmental influences by their effect on methyl transfer can impair fetal growth, reprogram metabolism and cause long-term morbidity in the offspring. The potential for their effects is underscored by the unique gestation-related changes in methyl transfer in healthy women, the late expression of transsulfuration cascade in the fetus and the unique metabolism of glycine and serine in the fetus. Dietary protein restriction in animal models and protein malnutrition in humans causes remarkable changes in the methyl transfer in vivo. Although the specific consequences of perturbation in maternal and fetal methyl transfer remain to be determined, a profound influence is suggested by the demonstrated relationship between maternal folate and B12 insufficiency and metabolic programming.</p>

<p>DL-2-hydroxy-(4-methylthio)butanoic acid (HMTBA) is a source of dietary methionine (Met) that is widely used in poultry nutrition. We have previously shown that HMTBA is preferentially diverted to the transsulfuration pathway, which gives antioxidant metabolites such as taurine and glutathione. Therefore, here we hypothesize that this Met source can protect epithelial barrier function in an in vitro model of intestinal inflammation of Caco-2 cells. The results show that HMTBA prevents the increase in paracellular permeability induced by H2O2 or tumour necrosis factor-a. This effect can be attributed to the increased production of taurine and reduced glutathione. Similar results were obtained for DL-Met, although the protective role of the amino acid was less pronounced than that of the hydroxy analogue. In conclusion, the diversion to the transsulfuration pathway means that this Met precursor is of greater value than previously thought, due to its capacity to improve intestinal homeostasis and the quality of poultry products destined for human consumption.</p>

<p>Following nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide) and carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide (or its newer systematic name sulfane, H2S) became the third small molecule that can be both toxic and beneficial depending on the concentration. In spite of its impressive therapeutic potential, the underlying mechanisms for its beneficial effects remain unclear. Any novel mechanism has to obey fundamental chemical principles. H2S chemistry was studied long before its biological relevance was discovered, however, with a few exceptions, these past works have received relatively little attention in the path of exploring the mechanistic conundrum of H2S biological functions. This review calls attention to the basic physical and chemical properties of H2S, focuses on the chemistry between H2S and its three potential biological targets: oxidants, metals and thiol derivatives, discusses the applications of these basics into H2S biology and methodology, and introduces the standard terminology to this youthful field.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine plays a number of pathophysiological roles. Hyperhomocysteinemia is involved in kidney fibrosis. However, the role of H2S in kidney fibrosis remains to be defined. Here, we investigated the role of H2S and its acting mechanism in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UO)-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. UO decreased expressions of CBS and CSE in the kidney with decrease of H2S concentration. Treatment with sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, a H2S producer) during UO reduced UO-induced oxidative stress with preservations of catalase, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression, and glutathione level. In addition, NaHS mitigated decreases of CBS and CSE expressions, and H2S concentration in the kidney. NaHS treatment attenuated UO-induced increases in levels of TGF-ß1, activated Smad3, and activated NF-<U+03BA>B. This study provided the first evidence of involvement of the transsulfuration pathway and H2S in UO-induced kidney fibrosis, suggesting that H2S and its transsulfuration pathway may be a potential target for development of therapeutics for fibrosis-related diseases.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cystathionine ß-lyase performs an essential role in the transsulfuration pathway by its primary reaction of forming homocysteine from cystathionine. Understanding how the Neurospora crassa met-2<U+207A> gene, which encodes cystathionine ß-lyase, is regulated is important in determining the basis of the cellular control of transsulfuration. The aim of this study was to determine the nature of a potential regulatory connection of met-2<U+207A> to the Neurospora sulfur regulatory network.FINDINGS: The cystathionine ß-lyase (met-2<U+207A>) gene was cloned by the identification of a cosmid genomic clone capable of transforming a met-2 mutant to methionine prototrophy and subsequently characterized. The gene contains a single intron and encodes a protein of 457 amino acids with conserved residues predicted to be important for catalysis and pyridoxal-5’-phosphate co-factor binding. The expression of met-2<U+207A> in wild-type N. crassa increased 3.1-fold under sulfur-limiting growth conditions as compared to the transcript levels seen under high sulfur growth conditions (i.e., repressing conditions). In a <U+0394>cys-3 strain, met-2<U+207A> transcript levels were substantially reduced under either low- or high-sulfur growth conditions. In addition, the presence of CYS3 activator binding sites on the met-2<U+207A> promoter was demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays.CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we demonstrate the sulfur-regulated expression of the met-2<U+207A> gene and confirm its connection to the N. crassa sulfur regulatory circuit by the reduced expression observed in a <U+0394>cys-3 mutant and the in vitro detection of CYS3 binding sites in the met-2<U+207A> promoter. The data further adds to our understanding of the regulatory dynamics of transsulfuration.</p>

<p>It has been known that silymarin exhibits protective activity against oxidative liver injury induced by various hepatotoxicants, but the underlying mechanism of its beneficial action remains unclear. We determined the alterations in sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism induced by silymarin in association with its effects on the antioxidant capacity of liver. Male mice were treated with silymarin (100 or 200 mg/kg, p. o.) every 12 h for a total of 3 doses, and sacrificed 6 h after the final dosing. The hepatic methionine level was increased, but the activity and protein expression of methionine adenosyltransferase were decreased by silymarin in a dose-dependent manner. S-Adenosylmethionine or homocysteine concentration was not changed, whereas the sulfur-containing metabolites generated from homocysteine in the transsulfuration pathway including cystathionine, cysteine, and glutathione were increased significantly. Cystathionine ß-synthase was induced, but cysteine dioxygenase was downregulated, both of which would contribute to the elevation of cysteine and its product, glutathione, in liver. Oxygen radical scavenging capacity of liver cytosol against peroxyl radical and peroxynitrite was increased, and also hepatic lipid peroxidation was diminished in the silymarin-treated mice. Taken together, the results demonstrate that silymarin enhances hepatic glutathione generation by elevating cysteine availability via an increment in cysteine synthesis and an inhibition of its catabolism to taurine, which may subsequently contribute to the antioxidant defense of liver.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress and DNA methylation are metabolically linked through the relationship between one-carbon metabolism and the transsulfuration pathway, but possible modulating effects of oxidative stress on DNA methylation have not been extensively studied in humans. Enzymes involved in DNA methylation, including DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, may show altered activity under oxidized cellular conditions. Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that glutathione (GSH) depletion leads to global DNA hypomethylation, possibly through the depletion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). We tested the hypothesis that a more oxidized blood GSH redox status is associated with decreased global peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA methylation in a sample of Bangladeshi adults. Global PBMC DNA methylation and whole blood GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and SAM concentrations were measured in 320 adults. DNA methylation was measured by using the [ (3)H]-methyl incorporation assay; values are inversely related to global DNA methylation. Whole blood GSH redox status (Eh) was calculated using the Nernst equation. We found that a more oxidized blood GSH Eh was associated with decreased global DNA methylation (B ± SE, 271 ± 103, p = 0.009). Blood SAM and blood GSH were associated with global DNA methylation, but these relationships did not achieve statistical significance. Our findings support the hypothesis that a more oxidized blood GSH redox status is associated with decreased global methylation of PBMC DNA. Furthermore, blood SAM does not appear to mediate this association. Future research should explore mechanisms through which cellular redox might influence global DNA methylation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: In vitro and rodent studies have shown that arsenic (As) exposure can deplete glutathione (GSH) and induce oxidative stress. GSH is the primary intracellular antioxidant; it donates an electron to reactive oxygen species, thus producing glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Cysteine (Cys) and cystine (CySS) are the predominant thiol/disulfide redox couple found in human plasma. Arsenic, GSH, and Cys are linked in several ways: a) GSH is synthesized via the transsulfuration pathway, and Cys is the rate-limiting substrate; b) intermediates of the methionine cycle regulate both the transsulfuration pathway and As methylation; c) GSH serves as the electron donor for reduction of arsenate to arsenite; and d) As has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and therefore binds to GSH and Cys.OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that As exposure is associated with decreases in GSH and Cys and increases in GSSG and CySS (i.e., a more oxidized environment).METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, the Folate and Oxidative Stress Study, we recruited a total of 378 participants from each of five water As concentration categories: &lt; 10 (n = 76), 10-100 (n = 104), 101-200 (n = 86), 201-300 (n = 67), and &gt; 300 µg/L (n = 45). Concentrations of GSH, GSSG, Cys, and CySS were measured using HPLC.RESULTS: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in water As was negatively associated with blood GSH (mean change, -25.4 µmol/L; 95% CI: -45.3, -5.31) and plasma CySS (mean change, -3.00 µmol/L; 95% CI: -4.61, -1.40). We observed similar associations with urine and blood As. There were no significant associations between As exposure and blood GSSG or plasma Cys.CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations are consistent with the hypothesis that As may influence concentrations of GSH and other nonprotein sulfhydryls through binding and irreversible loss in bile and/or possibly in urine.</p>

<p>Werner syndrome (WS) protein is involved in DNA repair and its truncation causes Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with a premature aging phenotype. WRN protein mutation is currently known as the primary cause of WS. In cultured WS fibroblasts, we found an increase in cytosolic aggregates and hypothesized that the phenotype is indirectly related to an excess activation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, leading to the formation of protein aggregates in the cytosol with increasing levels of oxidative stress. As we found that the expression levels of the two main H2S producing enzymes, cystathionine ß synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase, were lower in WS cells compared to normal, we investigated the effect of administration of H2S as NaHS (50µM). NaHS treatment blocked mTOR activity, abrogated protein aggregation and normalized the phenotype of WS cells. Similar results were obtained by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. This is the first report suggesting that hydrogen sulfide administered as NaHS restores proteostasis and cellular morphological phenotype of WS cells and hints to the importance of transsulfuration pathway in WS.</p>

<p>It has been known that liver regeneration is accompanied with a profound change in the metabolomics of sulfur-containing substances in liver. However, its physiological significance in the liver regenerative process is still unclear. Our previous work showed that buthioninesulfoximine and phorone, both widely used to deplete intracellular glutathione (GSH) in biological experiments, induced contrasting changes in the sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism in liver. In this study we employed these GSH-depleting agents to evaluate the role of sulfur-containing substances in the early phase of liver regeneration. Male rats treated with buthioninesulfoximine or phorone were subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PHx). At the doses used, the magnitude of GSH depletion after PHx was comparable, but buthioninesulfoximine administration inhibited the progression of liver regeneration as determined by liver weight increase, elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase activity, and cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein expressions, whereas liver recovery was significantly accelerated in the phorone-treated rats, suggesting that the role of GSH in this process is minimal. Hepatic concentrations of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, cysteine, taurine and GSH were all elevated by PHx. Methionine adenosyltransferase activity was also induced in the remnant liver. Buthioninesulfoximine administration depressed the elevation of S-adenosylmethionine, but increased the catabolism of cysteine to taurine. In contrast, S-adenosylmethionine elevation was augmented whereas cysteine, hypotaurine and taurine were decreased in the phorone-treated rats. PHx elevated hepatic putrescine and spermidine, but lowered spermine concentrations. Buthioninesulfoximine administration increased putrescine further, but decreased spermidine and spermine concentrations. On the contrary, both spermidine and spermine concentrations were elevated in the rats treated with phorone. The results suggest that the availability of S-adenosylmethionine plays a critical role in the progression of liver regeneration via enhancement of polyamine synthesis. These findings raise the possibility that regulating hepatic transsulfuration reactions may be capable of modifying the recovery process after liver injury.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma homocysteine has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic liver disease, which are major complications of diabetes. Hence, hepatic homocysteine metabolism has become a major focus of diabetes research. However, little information is available regarding plasma homocysteine levels in non-obese diabetic animals. Therefore, we investigated the hepatic metabolism of sulfur-amino acids in non-obese type-2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. The experiments were performed using 9-week-old Goto-Kakizaki rats and age-matched Wistar rats. The major finding of this study is that homocysteine levels in the liver and plasma are maintained by a balance between the up-regulation of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase and the inhibition of cystathionine ß-synthase in non-obese type-2 diabetic rats. Hepatic levels of cysteine and its metabolites, such as hypotaurine, taurine, and glutathione, were increased despite inhibition of the transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine. The elevated hepatic taurine and glutathione levels may be attributed to the up-regulation of cysteine dioxygenase expression and increased cysteine availability for glutathione synthesis. Inhibition of hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase activity in Goto-Kakizaki rats was associated with a decrease in hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, which serves as an allosteric activator of cystathionine ß-synthase. The non-obese type-2 diabetic condition results in profound changes in hepatic sulfur-amino acid metabolism and raises the possibility that sulfur-amino acid metabolism may be regulated by obesity- as well as diabetes-associated factors. Further study to elucidate the pathological significance of sulfur-amino acid metabolism in chronic liver disease in type-2 diabetic animals is underway in this laboratory.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Serum thiols have shown associations with surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease. However, little information is available on their combined association with validated cardiovascular risk scores for primary prevention at population level. We sought to determine whether individual serum thiol concentrations and substrate/product ratios within the transsulfuration pathway are independently associated with such scores.METHODS: Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, serum thiols (homocysteine, cysteine, taurine, glutamylcysteine, total glutathione and cysteinylglycine) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were collected from a sample of the Hunter Community Study without previous cardiovascular events [n=350, median age (IQR) = 62 (59-66) years]. Five-year absolute cardiovascular risk score for each subject was calculated using the Framingham Risk Equation.RESULTS: Median risk score was 7% (IQR 4-10). After adjusting for body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate and physical activity regression analysis showed independent associations between cardiovascular risk scores and a) higher serum homocysteine (B 0.066, 95% CI 0.040 to 0.091, P&lt;0.001) and lower cysteine (B -0.003, 95% CI -0.005 to -0.001, P=0.003) and glutathione (B -0.029, 95% CI -0.056 to -0.003, P=0.03) concentrations; and b) higher homocysteine/cysteine (B 0.114, 95% CI 0.066 to 0.161, P&lt;0.001) and lower glutathione/cysteinylglycine (B -1.145, 95% CI -2.030 to -0.260, P=0.011) ratios. No significant associations were observed between cardiovascular risk scores, taurine and CRP.CONCLUSIONS: Serum homocysteine, cysteine and glutathione are independently associated with cardiovascular risk scores at population level. Enzymatic pathways involved in reduced bioconversion of homocysteine into cysteine and increased glutathione degradation might play an important role in such associations.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress, hyperhomocysteinemia, altered DNA methylation, and insulin resistance in the brain are associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the role of amyloid-ß (Aß) in these events remains unclear. Intracellular cysteine is rate-limiting for synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), and factors regulating cysteine uptake exert a powerful influence over cellular redox status, especially in mature neurons where cysteine synthesis via transsulfuration of homocysteine (HCY) is restricted. We investigated the effect of soluble Aß oligomers (oAß) on basal and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-induced cysteine uptake mediated by the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3) in cultured human neuronal cells. We also examined the effect of oAß on intracellular thiol metabolite levels, DNA methylation, and the transcription status of redox and methylation-associated genes. oAß inhibited EAAT3-mediated cysteine uptake, causing a decrease in intracellular cysteine and GSH levels. The ratio of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine to the methylation inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine was decreased, in association with an increase in HCY and a global decrease in DNA methylation, indicative of decreased activity of the redox-sensitive enzyme methionine synthase. These metabolic effects of oAß coincided with changes in the expression of redox and methylation pathway genes. The ability of oAß to modulate gene expression via their redox and methylation-dependent epigenetic effects may contribute to the pathology of AD and recognition of this mechanism may lead to novel treatment approaches. We describe a role of IGF-1 signaling in regulating redox and methylation homeostasis, and propose this to be a pathogenic target of oAß.</p>

<p>The one-carbon metabolism (OCM) is considered key in maintaining DNA integrity and regulating gene expression, and may be involved in the process of carcinogenesis. Several B-vitamins and amino acids have been implicated in lung cancer risk, via the OCM directly as well as immune system activation. However it is unclear whether these factors act independently or through complex mechanisms. The current study applies structural equations modelling (SEM) to further disentangle the mechanisms involved in lung carcinogenesis. SEM allows simultaneous estimation of linear relations where a variable can be the outcome in one equation and the predictor in another, as well as allowing estimation using latent variables (factors estimated by correlation matrix). A large number of biomarkers have been analysed from 891 lung cancer cases and 1,747 controls nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Four putative mechanisms in the OCM and immunity were investigated in relation to lung cancer risk: methionine-homocysteine metabolism, folate cycle, transsulfuration, and mechanisms involved in inflammation and immune activation, all adjusted for tobacco exposure. The hypothesized SEM model confirmed a direct and protective effect for factors representing methionine-homocysteine metabolism (p = 0.020) and immune activation (p = 0.021), and an indirect protective effect of folate cycle (p = 0.019), after adjustment for tobacco smoking. In conclusion, our results show that in the investigation of the involvement of the OCM, the folate cycle and immune system in lung carcinogenesis, it is important to consider complex pathways (by applying SEM) rather than the effects of single vitamins or nutrients (e.g. using traditional multiple regression). In our study SEM were able to suggest a greater role of the methionine-homocysteine metabolism and immune activation over other potential mechanisms.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), a pathological condition characterized by an increase in plasma concentration of total homocysteine (Hcy), is recognized as a risk factor for several diseases. The transsulfuration pathway is the main metabolic fate of Hcy utilization, which requires the activity of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Our results showed the development of HHcy induced by psychological stress was mainly derived from a reduction of CBS activity in the liver, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in its mRNA level. It suggested that the hepatic CBS enzyme regulated by stress at the level of transcription would have a profound effect on circulating Hcy levels. The expression of Sp3, a negative factor for cbs transcription, obviously increased in hepatocytes nuclei of stressed rats, but Sp1 was not altered. It indicated that Sp3 was the key point of variations in cbs transcription caused by stress. Meanwhile, we detected that augmented plasma Hcy concentrations correlated with glucocordicoids (GCs) over-secretion in response to stress, and CBS mRNA levels were markedly lowered in GCs-treated rat hepatocytes. Further results found that glucocorticoids receptor (GR) expression in hepatocyte nuclei of stress rats and GR nuclear translocation ratio was increased, and the same results were proved by experiments in vitro, i.e., GR nuclear translocation and Sp3 expression was remarkably increased in GCs-treated hepatocytes. Moreover, results from ChIP suggested GCs enhanced the binding of GR to the regulatory region of the Sp3 promoter. These results indicated that GCs inhibit CBS transcription by up-regulating Sp3 in psychological stress-induced HHcy.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been recognized as an important physiologically relevant gasotransmitter. Produced by the enzymes involved in the transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), H2S has been implicated to control biological activity in virtually every organ system. In recent years it is being recognized that many commonly used H2S assays do not measure free H2S specifically and may be prone to artifacts. This has led to large variations in the reported H2S biological concentrations. In order to accurately study H2S’s functions in biological systems accurate assays which measure free H2S specifically are required. In this work we present a simple microplate-based colorimetric assay for H2S gas. The underside of a 96-well microplate cover was coated with Nafion polymer doped with Ag(+) ions. H2S is a highly volatile gas, and as it is volatilized in the microplate well it reacts with Ag(+) to produce Ag2S nanoparticles, which have a strong absorbance in the low-UV range. By monitoring the absorbance change from formation of Ag2S nanoparticles, H2S production can be monitored in real time. The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.61 nmol (8.70 µM) and a liner range up to 30 nmol (100 µM). Using the assay, the KM and Vmax of recombinant CSE enzyme were determined to be 11.13 ± 0.57 mM and 0.45 ± 0.01 nmol min(-1), respectively. H2S production from mouse liver homogenate under aerobic conditions in the presence of cysteine was measured and determined to be 4.89 ± 0.19 nmol min(-1) mL(-1) homogenate. The assay is simple, low cost, and specific to free H2S gas.</p>

<p>Obesity is an underlying risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Increased hepatic lipid accumulation is a hallmark in the progression of NAFLD and impairments in liver phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism may be central to the pathogenesis. Hepatic PC biosynthesis, which is linked to the one-carbon (C1) metabolism by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, is known to be important for hepatic lipid export by VLDL particles. Here, we assessed the influence of a high-fat (HF) diet and NAFLD status in mice on hepatic methyl-group expenditure and C1-metabolism by analyzing changes in gene expression, protein levels, metabolite concentrations, and nuclear epigenetic processes. In livers from HF diet induced obese mice a significant downregulation of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and an increased betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) expression were observed. Experiments in vitro, using hepatoma cells stimulated with peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa) agonist WY14,643, revealed a significantly reduced Cbs mRNA expression. Moreover, metabolite measurements identified decreased hepatic cystathionine and L-a-amino-n-butyrate concentrations as part of the transsulfuration pathway and reduced hepatic betaine concentrations, but no metabolite changes in the methionine cycle in HF diet fed mice compared to controls. Furthermore, we detected diminished hepatic gene expression of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3b but no effects on hepatic global genomic DNA methylation or hepatic DNA methylation in the Cbs promoter region upon HF diet. Our data suggest that HF diet induces a PPARa-mediated downregulation of key enzymes in the hepatic transsulfuration pathway and upregulates BHMT expression in mice to accommodate to enhanced dietary fat processing while preserving the essential amino acid methionine.</p>

<p>Cystathionine <U+03B3>-synthase (CGS) and cystathionine ß-lyase (CBL) share a common structure and several active-site residues, but catalyze distinct side-chain rearrangements in the two-step transsulfuration pathway that converts cysteine to homocysteine, the precursor of methionine. A series of 12 chimeric variants of Escherichia coli CGS (eCGS) and CBL (eCBL) was constructed to probe the roles of two structurally distinct, ~25-residue segments situated in proximity to the amino and carboxy termini and located at the entrance of the active-site. In vivo complementation of methionine-auxotrophic E. coli strains, lacking the genes encoding eCGS and eCBL, demonstrated that exchange of the targeted regions impairs the activity of the resulting enzymes, but does not produce a corresponding interchange of reaction specificity. In keeping with the in vivo results, the catalytic efficiency of the native reactions is reduced by at least 95-fold, and a,ß versus a,<U+03B3>-elimination specificity is not modified. The midpoint of thermal denaturation monitored by circular dichroism, ranges between 59 and 80°C, compared to 66°C for the two wild-type enzymes, indicating that the chimeric enzymes adopt a stable folded structure and that the observed reductions in catalytic efficiency are due to reorganization of the active site. Alanine-substitution variants of residues S32 and S33, as well as K42 of eCBL, situated in proximity to and within, respectively, the targeted amino-terminal region were also investigated to explore their role as determinants of reaction specificity via positioning of key active-site residues. The catalytic efficiency of the S32A, S33A and the K42A site-directed variants of eCBL is reduced by less than 10-fold, demonstrating that, while these residues may participate in positioning S339, which tethers the catalytic base, their role is minor.</p>

<p>Abstract Purpose: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme in the transsulfuration metabolic pathway, converts homocysteine to cystathionine, which is converted to cysteine required for the synthesis of major retinal antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Enzyme activity assays suggest that CBS is present in human and pig retina, however recent studies reported that CBS is not expressed in mouse retina. We found this species difference puzzling. Given the plethora of studies using mouse retina as a model system, coupled with the importance of GSH in retina, we investigated CBS expression in mouse retina at the molecular and cell biological level.</AbstractText>: Abstract Purpose: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme in the transsulfuration metabolic pathway, converts homocysteine to cystathionine, which is converted to cysteine required for the synthesis of major retinal antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Enzyme activity assays suggest that CBS is present in human and pig retina, however recent studies reported that CBS is not expressed in mouse retina. We found this species difference puzzling. Given the plethora of studies using mouse retina as a model system, coupled with the importance of GSH in retina, we investigated CBS expression in mouse retina at the molecular and cell biological level.METHODS: Wildtype (WT) mice or mice lacking the gene encoding CBS (cbs(-)(/)(-)) were used in these studies. RNA and protein were isolated from retinas and liver (positive control) for the analysis of cbs gene expression by RT-PCR and CBS protein expression by Western blotting, respectively. CBS was analyzed by immunofluorescence in retinal cryosections and primary retinal cells (ganglion, Müller, retinal pigment epithelial). CBS enzyme activity was measured in primary Müller cells.RESULTS: RT-PCR revealed robust cbs expression in WT liver, brain and retina. Western blotting detected CBS in retina, brain and liver of WT mice, but not in cbs(-)(/)(-) mice liver. In immunohistochemical studies, CBS was present abundantly in the ganglion cell layer of retina; it was detected also in primary isolations of Müller, RPE and ganglion cells. CBS activity was detected in Müller cells by fluorescent detection of H2S.CONCLUSIONS: We have compelling molecular evidence that CBS is expressed in mouse retina at the gene and protein level. Our immunofluorescence data suggest that it is present in several retinal cell types and the data from the enzyme activity assay suggest activity in Müller cells. These findings set the stage to investigate the role of CBS and the transsulfuration pathway in the generation of GSH in mouse retina.</p>

<p>Increasing evidence suggests that obesity is a chronic inflammatory disease, in which adipose tissue is involved in a network of endocrine signals to modulate energy homeostasis. These oxidative-inflammatory pathways, which are associated with cardiovascular complications, are also observed during the aging process. In this study, we investigated the interaction between aging and the development of obesity in a hyperphagic rat model. Metabolic profiles of the liver, white adipose tissue (WAT) and heart from young and adult Zucker lean (fa/+) and obese (fa/fa) rats were characterized using a (1)H NMR-based metabonomics approach. We observed premature metabolic modifications in all studied organs in obese animals, some of which were comparable to those observed in adult lean animals. In the cardiac tissue, young obese rats displayed lower lactate and scyllo-inositol levels associated with higher creatine, choline and phosphocholine levels, indicating an early modulation of energy and membrane metabolism. An early alteration of the hepatic methylation and transsulfuration pathways in both groups of obese rats indicated that these pathways were affected before diabetic onset. These findings therefore support the hypothesis that obesity parallels some metabolic perturbations observed in the aging process and provides new insights into the metabolic modifications occurring in prediabetic state.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of quercetin on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and hepatic antioxidant status in high methionine (Met)-fed rats.METHODS: Rats were fed for 6 wk the following diets: control, 1.0% Met, 1.0% Met and 0.1% quercetin, 1.0% Met and 0.5% quercetin, 1.0% Met and 2.5% quercetin-supplemented diets. Serum Hcy, Met, cysteine, serine, taurine, glutathione (GSH), quercetin and its metabolites, and activities of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were assayed. Hepatic malondialdehyde, GSH and carbonyls, and activity of superoxide dismutase and ferric-reducing antioxidant power also were measured.RESULTS: Serum Hcy was increased significantly after Met treatment and decreased after quercetin supplementation. Meanwhile, serum taurine was increased and serine decreased. However, the content of GSH in serum and liver was decreased in the quercetin-supplemented groups and activities of serum ALT and AST were enhanced in the 1.0% Met and 2.5% quercetin-supplemented groups.CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin is effective in decreasing serum Hcy level in high Met-fed rats and one of possible mechanisms is associated with increased transsulfuration of Hcy. Quercetin can acts as a prooxidant at high intake levels.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Serum homocysteine, when studied singly, has been reported to be positively associated both with the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine [ADMA, via inhibition of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity] and with symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). We investigated combined associations between transsulfuration pathway thiols, including homocysteine, and serum ADMA and SDMA concentrations at population level.METHODS: Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, medication exposure, C-reactive protein, serum ADMA and SDMA (LC-MS/MS), and thiols (homocysteine, cysteine, taurine, glutamylcysteine, total glutathione, and cysteinylglycine; capillary electrophoresis) were collected from a sample of the Hunter Community Study on human ageing [n = 498, median age (IQR) = 64 (60-70) years].RESULTS: REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT: a) age (P = 0.001), gender (P = 0.03), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, P = 0.08), body mass index (P = 0.008), treatment with beta-blockers (P = 0.03), homocysteine (P = 0.02), and glutamylcysteine (P = 0.003) were independently associated with higher ADMA concentrations; and b) age (P = 0.001), absence of diabetes (P = 0.001), lower body mass index (P = 0.01), lower eGFR (P&lt;0.001), cysteine (P = 0.007), and glutamylcysteine (P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with higher SDMA concentrations. No significant associations were observed between methylated arginines and either glutathione or taurine concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for clinical, demographic, biochemical, and pharmacological confounders the combined assessment of transsulfuration pathway thiols shows that glutamylcysteine has the strongest and positive independent associations with ADMA and SDMA. Whether this reflects a direct effect of glutamylcysteine on DDAH activity (for ADMA) and/or cationic amino acid transport requires further investigations.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: There is evidence from a study of pregnant American women that methionine transmethylation (TM) and remethylation (RM) rates increases and transulfuration (TS) decreases as pregnancy progresses from trimester 1 to 3. To determine whether pregnant Indian women can make this adaptation successfully, methionine kinetics, TS, TM, and RM were measured in Indian women in early and late pregnancy.METHODS: Measurements were made in the postabsorptive and fed states in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy by infusing 1-(13)C,(2)H3-methionine in 24 women, 12 with low (=150 pmol L(-1)) and 12 with normal (=200 pmol L(-1)) vitamin B12 status at recruitment.RESULTS: From trimester 1 to 3, except RM which decreased significantly, there was no change in any weight-specific methionine kinetic parameter. When expressed per whole body, methionine flux from protein breakdown increased significantly from trimester 1 to 3 in the fed and postabsorptive states. Flux to protein synthesis also increased significantly in the fed state. Rates of TM, TS and RM did not change, regardless of vitamin B12 status at recruitment. Protein and methionine intakes correlated with TM and RM rates and the change in RM from trimester 1 to 3 correlated with the change in dietary protein intake.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that methionine flux and its utilization for protein synthesis increases in Indian women as pregnancy progresses from trimester 1 to 3. TM and RM rates do not increase however, possibly because of inadequate protein intake and not because of vitamin B12 deficiency at trimester 1.</p>

<p>Pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP), the bioactive form of vitamin B6, reportedly functions as a prosthetic group for &gt;4% of classified enzymatic activities of the cell. It is therefore not surprising that alterations of vitamin B6 metabolism have been associated with multiple human diseases. As a striking example, mutations in the gene coding for antiquitin, an evolutionary old aldehyde dehydrogenase, result in pyridoxine-dependent seizures, owing to the accumulation of a metabolic intermediate that inactivates PLP. In addition, PLP is required for the catabolism of homocysteine by transsulfuration. Hence, reduced circulating levels of B6 vitamers (including PLP as well as its major precursor pyridoxine) are frequently paralleled by hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition that has been associated with an increased risk for multiple cardiovascular diseases. During the past 30 years, an intense wave of clinical investigation has attempted to dissect the putative links between vitamin B6 and cancer. Thus, high circulating levels of vitamin B6, as such or as they reflected reduced amounts of circulating homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients bearing a wide range of hematological and solid neoplasms. More recently, the proficiency of vitamin B6 metabolism has been shown to modulate the adaptive response of tumor cells to a plethora of physical and chemical stress conditions. Moreover, elevated levels of pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the enzyme that converts pyridoxine and other vitamin B6 precursors into PLP, have been shown to constitute a good, therapy-independent prognostic marker in patients affected by non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Here, we will discuss the clinical relevance of vitamin B6 metabolism as a prognostic factor in cancer patients.</p>

<p>Vitamin B6 functions as a coenzyme in &gt;140 enzymatic reactions involved in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, neurotransmitters, and lipids. It comprises a group of three related 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-pyrimidine derivatives: pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM) and their phosphorylated derivatives [pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5’-phosphate (PMP)], In the folate metabolism pathway, PLP is a cofactor for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isozymes of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2 and SHMT1), the P-protein of the glycine cleavage system, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and <U+03B3>-cystathionase, and betaine hydroxymethyltransferase (BHMT), all of which contribute to homocysteine metabolism either through folate- mediated one-carbon metabolism or the transsulfuration pathway. Folate cofactors carry and chemically activate single carbons for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate and methionine. So the evidence indicates that vitamin B6 plays an important role in maintenance of the genome, epigenetic stability and homocysteine metabolism. This article focuses on studies of strand breaks, micronuclei, or chromosomal aberrations regarding protective effects of vitamin B6, and probes whether it is folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism or the transsulfuration pathway for vitamin B6 which plays critical roles in prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine and occupies a crucial regulatory position between the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of cysteine by transsulfuration. It was reported that CBS was a novel marker of both differentiation and proliferation for certain cell types, suggesting that CBS represents a survival-promoting protein. However, its expression and function in the central nervous system lesion are not well understood. To investigate changes of CBS after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its possible role, mice TBI model was established by controlled cortical impact system, and the expression and cellular localization of CBS after TBI was investigated in the present study. Western blot analysis revealed that CBS was present in normal mice brain cortex. It gradually decreased, reached a valley at the third day after TBI, and then restored to basal level. Importantly, more CBS was colocalized with neuron. In addition, Western blot detection showed that the third day postinjury was also the apoptosis peak indicated by the elevated expression of caspase-3. Importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that injury-induced expression of CBS was colabeled by Bcl-2 and had no co-localization with caspase-3. These data suggested that CBS may be implicated in the apoptosis of neuron and involved in the pathophysiology of brain after TBI.</p>

<p>Impaired utilization of folate is caused by insufficient dietary intake and/or genetic variation and has been shown to prompt changes in related pathways, including choline and methionine metabolism. These pathways have been shown to be sensitive to variation within the Mthfd1 gene, which codes for a folate-metabolizing enzyme responsible for generating 1-carbon (1-C)-substituted folate derivatives. The Mthfd1(gt/+) mouse serves as a potential model of human Mthfd1 loss-of-function genetic variants that impair MTHFD1 function. This study investigated the effects of the Mthfd1(gt/+) genotype and folate intake on markers of choline, folate, methionine, and transsulfuration metabolism. Male Mthfd1(gt/+) and Mthfd1(+/+) mice were randomly assigned at weaning (3 wk of age) to either a control (2 mg/kg folic acid) or folate-deficient (0 mg/kg folic acid) diet for 5 wk. Mice were killed at 8 wk of age following 12 h of food deprivation; blood and liver samples were analyzed for choline, methionine, and transsulfuration biomarkers. Independent of folate intake, mice with the Mthfd1(gt/+) genotype had higher hepatic concentrations of choline (P = 0.005), betaine (P = 0.013), and dimethylglycine (P = 0.004) and lower hepatic concentrations of glycerophosphocholine (P = 0.002) relative to Mthfd1(+/+) mice. Mthfd1(gt/+) mice also had higher plasma concentrations of homocysteine (P = 0.0016) and cysteine (P &lt; 0.001) as well as lower plasma concentrations of methionine (P = 0.0003) and cystathionine (P = 0.011). The metabolic alterations observed in Mthfd1(gt/+) mice indicate perturbed choline and folate-dependent 1-C metabolism and support the future use of Mthfd1(gt/+) mice as a tool to investigate the impact of impaired 1-C metabolism on disease outcomes.</p>

<p>The authors report the case of a 4-year-old boy who developed progressive unilateral weakness and developmental delays prior to his diagnosis of classical homocystinuria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated diffuse white matter changes, raising the concern for a secondary diagnosis causing leukoencephalopathy, since classical homocystinuria is not typically associated with these changes. Other inborn errors of the transsulfuration pathway have been reported as causing these changes. Once begun on therapy for his homocystinuria, his neurologic deficits resolved and his delays rapidly improved. Repeat MRI performed one year after instating therapy showed resolution of his white matter abnormalities. This case illustrates the need to consider homocystinuria and other amino acidopathies in the differential diagnosis of childhood white matter diseases and lends weight to the hypothesis that hypermethioninemia may induce white matter changes.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a recently described endogenously produced gaseous signaling molecule that influences various cellular processes in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal tract. The biogenesis of H(2)S involves the cytoplasmic transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and <U+03B3>-cystathionase, whereas its catabolism occurs in the mitochondrion and couples to the energy-yielding electron transfer chain. Low steady-state levels of H(2)S appear to be controlled primarily by efficient oxygen-dependent catabolism via sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase (ETHE1), rhodanese, and sulfite oxidase. Mutations in the persulfide dioxgenase, i.e. ETHE1, result in ethylmalonic encephalopathy, an inborn error of metabolism. In this study, we report the biochemical characterization and kinetic properties of human persulfide dioxygenase and describe the biochemical penalties associated with two patient mutations, T152I and D196N. Steady-state kinetic analysis reveals that the T152I mutation results in a 3-fold lower activity, which is correlated with a 3-fold lower iron content compared with the wild-type enzyme. The D196N mutation results in a 2-fold higher K(m) for the substrate, glutathione persulfide.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, namely the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine. Mutations in the CBS gene are the single most common cause of hereditary homocystinuria, a multisystemic disease affecting to various extents the vasculature, connective tissues and central nervous system. At present, the crystal structure of CBS from Drosophila melanogaster is the only available structure of the full-length enzyme. Here we describe a cloning, overexpression, purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of a full-length CBS from Apis mellifera (AmCBS) which maintains 51 and 46% sequence identity with its Drosophila and human homologs, respectively. The AmCBS yielded crystals belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=85.90, b=95.87, c=180.33 Å. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 3.0 Å. The crystal structure contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit which presumably correspond to the dimeric species observed in solution.</p>

<p>This minireview mainly aims at the study of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) production by microbial fermentation. A brief introduction of the biological role and application of SAM was presented. In general, SAM production can be improved by breeding of the producing strain through the conventional mutation or genetic engineering approach in the molecular or cellular scale, by optimization of culture conditions in the cellular scale or bioreactor engineering scale, or by multiscale approach. The productivity of SAM fermentation has been improved greatly through the efforts of many researchers using the methods previously mentioned. The SAM-producing strains used extensively are Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effect of SAM on antibiotic production was also exemplified. The skill and scheme beneficial to the improvement of SAM production involves the enhancement of SAM synthetase (methionine adenosyltransferase) activity and selection of engineered constitutive promoters with appropriate strength; seeking for and eliminating the rate-limiting factors in SAM synthesis, namely, knocking off the genes that transform SAM and L-methionine (L-Met) to cysteine; release the feedback inhibition of SAM to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; blocking the transsulfuration pathway by interfering the responsible enzymes; enhancing ATP level through pulsed feeding of glycerol; and optimizing the L-Met feeding strategy. Precise control of gene expression and quantitative assessment of physiological parameters in engineered P. pastoris were highlighted. Finally, a discussion of the prospect of SAM production was presented.</p>

<p>Tamoxifen (TAM) resistance is a main cause of therapeutic failure in breast cancers. Although methionine dependency is a phenotypic characteristic of tumor cells, the role of sulfur amino acid metabolism in chemotherapy resistance remains to be elucidated. This study compared metabolite profiles of sulfur amino acid metabolism from methionine to taurine or glutathione (GSH) between normal MCF-7 and TAM-resistant MCF-7 (TAMR-MCF-7) cells. TAMR-MCF-7 cells showed elevated levels and activities of enzymes involved in both transsulfuration from methionine to cysteine and metabolism of cysteine to GSH and taurine. Cysteine concentrations in TAMR-MCF-7 cells and medium conditioned by cell culture for 42h were markedly decreased, while GSH, hypotaurine, and taurine concentrations in the medium were increased. These results show that TAMR-MCF-7 cells display enhanced cysteine utilization. The addition of propargylglycine, a specific cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase inhibitor, and buthionine sulfoximine, a specific <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine ligase inhibitor, to TAMR-MCF-7 cells, but not to MCF-7 cells, resulted in cytotoxicity after sulfur amino acid deprivation. These results suggest that cell viability of TAMR-MCF-7 cells is affected by inhibition of sulfur amino acid metabolism, particularly cysteine synthesis from homocysteine and GSH synthesis from cysteine. Additionally, the S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, an index of transmethylation potential, in TAMR-MCF-7 cells increased to ~3.6-fold relative to that in MCF-7 cells, a finding that may result from upregulation of methionine adenosyltransferase IIa and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. In conclusion, this study suggests that TAMR-MCF-7 cells display enhanced cysteine utilization for synthesis of GSH and taurine, and are sensitive to inhibition of cysteine metabolism.</p>

<p>Availability of methionine is known to modulate the rate of aging in model organisms, best illustrated by the observation that dietary methionine restriction extends the lifespan of rodents. However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In eukaryotic cells, methionine can be converted to cysteine through the reverse transsulfuration pathway thereby modulating intracellular methionine availability. Whereas previous results obtained in yeast and fruit flies suggest that alterations in the reverse transsulfuration pathway modulate the rate of aging, it is not known whether this function is conserved in evolution. Here we show that depletion of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), a rate limiting enzyme in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, induces premature senescence in human endothelial cells. We found that CBS depletion induces mild mitochondrial dysfunction and increases the sensitivity of endothelial cells to homocysteine, a known inducer of endothelial cell senescence and an established risk factor for vascular disease. Our finding that CBS deficiency induces endothelial cell senescencein vitro, involving both mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility of the cells to homocysteine, suggests a new mechanism linking CBS deficiency to vascular aging and disease.</p>

<p>Convincing evidence links aberrant B-vitamin dependent hepatic methionine metabolism to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This review focuses on the essential roles of folate and vitamins B6 and B12 in hepatic methionine metabolism, the causes of their deficiencies among chronic alcoholic persons, and how their deficiencies together with chronic alcohol exposure impact on aberrant methionine metabolism in the pathogenesis of ALD. Folate is the dietary transmethylation donor for the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is the substrate for all methyltransferases that regulate gene expressions in pathways of liver injury, as well as a regulator of the transsulfuration pathway that is essential for production of glutathione (GSH), the principal antioxidant for defense against oxidative liver injury. Vitamin B12 regulates transmethylation reactions for SAM production and vitamin B6 regulates transsulfuration reactions for GSH production. Folate deficiency accelerates the experimental development of ALD in ethanol-fed animals while reducing liver SAM levels with resultant abnormal gene expression and decreased production of antioxidant GSH. Through its effects on folate metabolism, reduced SAM also impairs nucleotide balance with resultant increased DNA strand breaks, oxidation, hepatocellular apoptosis, and risk of carcinogenesis. The review encompasses referenced studies on mechanisms for perturbations of methionine metabolism in ALD, evidence for altered gene expressions and their epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of ALD, and clinical studies on potential prevention and treatment of ALD by correction of methionine metabolism with SAM.</p>

Previous studies have implicated maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and altered metabolism in folate-related pathways as CHD risk factors.OBJECTIVE: We sought to discover associations between maternal SNPs and metabolites involved in the homocysteine, folate, and transsulfuration pathways, and determine if these associations differ between CHD cases and controls.DESIGN: Genetic, metabolic, demographic, and lifestyle information was available for 335 mothers with CHD-affected pregnancies and 263 mothers with unaffected pregnancies. Analysis was conducted on 1160 SNPs, 13 plasma metabolites, and 2 metabolite ratios. A two-stage multiple linear regression was fitted to each combination of SNP and metabolite/ratio.RESULTS: We identified 4 SNPs in the methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha (MAT2A) gene that were associated with methionine levels. Three SNPs in tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1 (TRDMT1) gene were associated with total plasma folate levels. Glutamylcysteine (GluCys) levels were associated with multiple SNPs within the glutathione peroxidase 6 (GPX6) and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) genes. The regression model revealed interactions between genotype and case-control status in the association of total plasma folate, total glutathione (GSH), and free GSH, to SNPs within the MGMT, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS), and catalase (CAT) genes, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides further evidence that genetic variation within folate-related pathways accounts for inter-individual variability in key metabolites. We identified specific SNP-metabolite relationships that differed in mothers with CHD-affected pregnancies, compared to controls. Our results underscore the importance of multifactorial studies to define maternal CHD risk.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, which is critical for the synthesis of cysteine from methionine in eukaryotes. CBS uses coenzyme pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) for catalysis, and S-adenosylmethionine regulates the activity of human CBS, but not yeast CBS. Human and fruit fly CBS contain heme; however, the role for heme is not clear. This paper reports biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of CBS from fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (DmCBS) and the CO/NO gas binding reactions of DmCBS and human CBS. Like CBS enzymes from lower organisms (e.g., yeast), DmCBS is intrinsically highly active and is not regulated by AdoMet. The DmCBS heme coordination environment, the reactivity, and the accompanying effects on enzyme activity are similar to those of human CBS. The DmCBS heme bears histidine and cysteine axial ligands, and the enzyme becomes inactive when the cysteine ligand is replaced. The Fe(II) heme in DmCBS is less stable than that in human CBS, undergoing more facile reoxidation and ligand exchange. In both CBS proteins, the overall stability of the protein is correlated with the heme oxidation state. Human and DmCBS Fe(II) hemes react relatively slowly with CO and NO, and the rate of the CO binding reaction is faster at low pH than at high pH. Together, the results suggest that heme incorporation and AdoMet regulation in CBS are not correlated, possibly providing two independent means for regulating the enzyme.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is an independent risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases. There are two ways to remove homocysteine from embryonic cardiac cells: remethylation to form methionine or transsulfuration to form cysteine. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first step of homocysteine transsulfuration as a rate-limiting enzyme. In this study, we identified a functional variant -4673C&gt;G (rs2850144) in the CBS gene promoter region that significantly reduces the susceptibility to congenital heart disease (CHD) in a Han Chinese population consisting of 2 340 CHD patients and 2 270 controls. Individuals carrying the heterozygous CG and homozygous GG genotypes had a 15% (odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-0.96, P = 0.011) and 40% (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.49-0.73, P = 1.78 × 10(-7)) reduced risk to develop CHD than the wild-type CC genotype carriers in the combined samples, respectively. Additional stratified analyses demonstrated that CBS -4673C&gt;G is significantly related to septation defects and conotruncal defects. In vivo detection of CBS mRNA levels in human cardiac tissues and in vitro luciferase assays consistently showed that the minor G allele significantly increased CBS transcription. A functional analysis revealed that both the attenuated transcription suppressor SP1 binding affinity and the CBS promoter hypomethylation specifically linked with the minor G allele contributed to the remarkably upregulated CBS expression. Consequently, the carriers with genetically increased CBS expression would benefit from the protection due to the low homocysteine levels maintained by CBS in certain cells during the critical heart development stages. These results shed light on unexpected role of CBS and highlight the importance of homocysteine removal in cardiac development.Cell Research advance online publication 18 September 2012; <a href="doi:10.1038/cr.2012.135" class="uri">doi:10.1038/cr.2012.135</a>.</p>

<p>Human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a unique pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that has a regulatory heme cofactor. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of Arg-266, a residue at the heme pocket end of a-helix 8, for communication between the heme and PLP sites. In this study, we have examined the role of the conserved Thr-257 and Thr-260 residues, located at the other end of a-helix 8 on the heme electronic environment and on activity. The mutations at the two positions destabilize PLP binding, leading to lower PLP content and ~2- to ~500-fold lower activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Activity is unresponsive to PLP supplementation, consistent with the pyridoxine-nonresponsive phenotype of the T257M mutation in a homocystinuric patient. The H(2)S-producing activities, also impacted by the mutations, show a different pattern of inhibition compared with the canonical transsulfuration reaction. Interestingly, the mutants exhibit contrasting sensitivities to the allosteric effector, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet); whereas T257M and T257I are inhibited, the other mutants are hyperactivated by AdoMet. All mutants showed an increased propensity of the ferrous heme to form an inactive species with a 424 nm Soret peak and exhibited significantly reduced enzyme activity in the ferrous and ferrous-CO states. Our results provide the first evidence for bidirectional transmission of information between the cofactor binding sites, suggest the additional involvement of this region in allosteric communication with the regulatory AdoMet-binding domain, and reveal the potential for independent modulation of the canonical transsulfuration versus H(2)S-generating reactions catalyzed by CBS.</p>

<p>Trypanosoma cruzi is expected to synthetize de novo cysteine by different routes, among which the two-step pathway involving serine acetyltransferase and cysteine synthase (CS) is comprised. Also, cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) might contribute to the de novo generation of cysteine in addition to catalyze the first step of the reverse transsulfuration route producing cystathionine. However, neither the functionality of CS nor that of cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CGL) has been assessed. Our results show that T. cruzi CS could participate notably more actively than CBS in the de novo synthesis of cysteine. Interestingly, at the protein level T. cruzi CS is more abundant in amastigotes than in epimastigotes. Unlike the mammalian homologues, T. cruzi CGL specifically cleaves cystathionine into cysteine and is unable to produce H(2)S. The expression pattern of T. cruzi CGL parallels that of CBS, which unexpectedly suggests that in addition to the de novo synthesis of cysteine, the reverse transsulfuration pathway could be operative in the mammalian and insect stages. Besides, T. cruzi CBS produces H(2)S by decomposing cysteine or via condensation of cysteine with homocysteine. The latter reaction leads to cystathionine production, and is catalyzed remarkably more efficiently than the breakdown of cysteine. In T. cruzi like in other organisms, H(2)S could exert regulatory effects on varied metabolic processes. Notably, T. cruzi seems to count on stage-specific routes involved in cysteine production, the multiple cysteine-processing alternatives could presumably reflect this parasite’s high needs of reducing power for detoxification of reactive oxygen species.</p>

<p>Despite extensive studies of methylmercury (MeHg) toxicity in birds, molecular effects on birds are poorly characterized. To improve our understanding of toxicity pathways and identify novel indicators of avian exposure to Hg, the authors investigated genomic changes, glutathione status, and oxidative status indicators in liver from laughing gull (Larus atricilla) hatchlings that were exposed in ovo to MeHg (0.05-1.6 µg/g). Genes involved in the transsulfuration pathway, iron transport and storage, thyroid-hormone related processes, and cellular respiration were identified by suppression subtractive hybridization as differentially expressed. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) identified statistically significant effects of Hg on cytochrome C oxidase subunits I and II, transferrin, and methionine adenosyltransferase RNA expression. Glutathione-S-transferase activity and protein-bound sulfhydryl levels decreased, whereas glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity increased dose-dependently. Total sulfhydryl concentrations were significantly lower at 0.4 µg/g Hg than in controls. Together, these endpoints provided some evidence of compensatory effects, but little indication of oxidative damage at the tested doses, and suggest that sequestration of Hg through various pathways may be important for minimizing toxicity in laughing gulls. This is the first study to describe the genomic response of an avian species to Hg. Laughing gulls are among the less sensitive avian species with regard to Hg toxicity, and their ability to prevent hepatic oxidative stress may be important for surviving levels of MeHg exposures at which other species succumb.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been found to play beneficial roles in ameliorating several diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiac/renal ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), the main enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway, catalyze H(2)S production in mammalian tissues. However, the distributions and precise roles of these enzymes in the kidney have not yet been identified.METHODS: The present study examined the localization of both enzymes in the normal kidney and the effect of the H(2)S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) in the renal peritubular capillary (PTC) under conditions of diabetic nephropathy, using pancreatic ß-cell-specific calmodulin-overexpressing transgenic mice as a model of diabetes.RESULTS: In the normal kidney, we detected expression of both CBS and CSE in the brush border and cytoplasm of the proximal tubules, but not in the glomeruli, distal tubules and vascular endothelial cells of renal PTCs. Administration of NaHS increased PTC diameter and blood flow. We further evaluated whether biosynthesis of H(2)S was altered in a spontaneous diabetic model that developed renal lesions similar to human diabetic nephropathy. CSE expression was markedly reduced under diabetic conditions, whereas CBS expression was unaffected. Progressive diabetic nephropathy showed vasoconstriction and a loss of blood flow in PTCs that was ameliorated by NaHS treatment.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CSE expression in the proximal tubules may also regulate tubulointerstitial microcirculation via H(2)S production. H(2)S may represent a target of treatment to prevent progression of ischemic injury in diabetic nephropathy.</p>

<p>Cystathionine <U+03B3>-synthase (CGS) catalyzes the condensation of O-succinyl-L-homoserine (L-OSHS) and L-cysteine (L-Cys), to produce L-cystathionine (L-Cth) and succinate, in the first step of the bacterial transsulfuration pathway. In the absence of L-Cys, the enzyme catalyzes the futile a,<U+03B3>-elimination of L-OSHS, yielding succinate, a-ketobutyrate, and ammonia. A series of 16 site-directed variants of Escherichia coli CGS (eCGS) was constructed to probe the roles of active-site residues D45, Y46, R48, R49, Y101, R106, N227, E325, S326, and R361. The effects of these substitutions on the catalytic efficiency of the a,<U+03B3>-elimination reaction range from a reduction of only ~2-fold for R49K and the E325A,Q variants to 310- and 760-fold for R361K and R48K, respectively. A similar trend is observed for the k(cat) /K(m)(l-OSHS) of the physiological, a,<U+03B3>-replacement reaction. The results of this study suggest that the arginine residues at positions 48, 106 and 361 of eCGS, conserved in bacterial CGS sequences, tether the distal and a-carboxylate moieties, respectively, of the L-OSHS substrate. In contrast, with the exception of the 13-fold increase observed for R106A, the K(m)(l-Cys) is not markedly affected by the site-directed replacement of the residues investigated. The decrease in k(cat) observed for the S326A variant reflects the role of this residue in tethering the side chain of K198, the catalytic base. Although no structures exist of eCGS bound to active-site ligands, the roles of individual residues is consistent with the structures inhibitor complexes of related enzymes. Substitution of D45, E325, or Y101 enables a minor transamination activity for the substrate L-Ala.</p>

<p>Cystathionine (R-S-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-l-homocysteine) is a non-proteinogenic thioether containing amino acid. In mammals, cystathionine is formed as an intermediate of the transsulfuration pathway by the condensation of serine and homocysteine (Hcy) in a reaction catalyzed by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Cystathionine is subsequently converted to cysteine plus ammonia and a-ketobutyrate by the action of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL). Pathogenic mutations in CBS result in CBS-deficient homocystinuria (HCU) which, if untreated, results in mental retardation, thromboembolic complications and connective tissue disorders. Currently there is no known function for cystathionine other than serving as an intermediate in transsulfuration and to date, the possible contribution of the abolition of cystathionine synthesis to pathogenesis in HCU has not been investigated. Using both mouse and cell-culture models, we have found that cystathionine is capable of blocking the induction of hepatic steatosis and kidney injury, acute tubular necrosis, and apoptotic cell death by the endoplasmic reticulum stress inducing agent tunicamycin. Northern and Western blotting analysis indicate that the protective effects of cystathionine occur without any obvious alteration of the induction of the unfolded protein response. Our data constitute the first experimental evidence that the abolition of cystathionine synthesis may contribute to the pathology of HCU and that this compound has therapeutic potential for disease states where ER stress is implicated as a primary initiating pathogenic factor.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase plays a key role in the transsulfuration pathway through its primary reaction of catalyzing the formation of cysteine from cystathionine. The Neurospora crassa cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase gene (cys-16(+)) is of particular interest in dissecting the regulation and dynamics of transsulfuration. The aim of this study was to determine the regulatory connection of cys-16(+) to the Neurospora sulfur regulatory network. In addition, the cys-16(+) promoter was characterized with the goal of developing a strongly expressed and regulatable gene expression tool.FINDINGS: The cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase cys-16(+) gene was cloned and characterized. The gene, which contains no introns, encodes a protein of 417 amino acids with conserved pyridoxal 5’-phosphate binding site and substrate-cofactor binding pocket. Northern blot analysis using wild type cells showed that cys-16(+) transcript levels increased under sulfur limiting (derepressing) conditions and were present only at a low level under sulfur sufficient (repressing) conditions. In contrast, cys-16(+) transcript levels in a <U+0394>cys-3 regulatory mutant were present at a low level under either derepressing or repressing conditions. Gel mobility shift analysis demonstrated the presence of four CYS3 transcriptional activator binding sites on the cys-16(+) promoter, which were close matches to the CYS3 consensus binding sequence.CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we confirm the control of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase gene expression by the CYS3 transcriptional activator through the loss of cys-16(+) expression in a <U+0394>cys-3 mutant and through the in vitro binding of CYS3 to the cys-16(+) promoter at four sites. The highly regulated cys-16(+) promoter should be a useful tool for gene expression studies in Neurospora.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is an essential pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway that condenses serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine; intriguingly, human CBS also contains a heme b cofactor of unknown function. Herein we describe the enzymatic and spectroscopic properties of a disease-associated R266K hCBS variant, which has an altered hydrogen-bonding environment. The R266K hCBS contains a low-spin, six-coordinate Fe(III) heme bearing a His/Cys ligation motif, like that of WT hCBS; however, there is a geometric distortion that exists at the R266K heme. Using rR spectroscopy, we show that the Fe(III)-Cys(thiolate) bond is longer and weaker in R266K, as evidenced by an 8 cm(-1) downshift in the <U+03BD>(Fe-S) resonance. Presence of this longer and weaker Fe(III)-Cys(thiolate) bond is correlated with alteration of the fluorescence spectrum of the active PLP ketoenamine tautomer. Activity data demonstrate that, relative to WT, the R266K variant is more impaired in the alternative cysteine-synthesis reaction than in the canonical cystathionine-synthesis reaction. This diminished cysteine synthesis activity and a greater sensitivity to exogenous PLP correlate with the change in PLP environment. Fe-S(Cys) bond weakening causes a nearly 300-fold increase in the rate of ligand switching upon reduction of the R266K heme. Combined, these data demonstrate cross talk between the heme and PLP active sites, consistent with previous proposals, revealing that alteration of the Arg(266)-Cys(52) interaction affects PLP-dependent activity and dramatically destabilizes the ferrous thiolate-ligated heme complex, underscoring the importance of this hydrogen-bonding residue pair.</p>

<p>Gene promoter hypermethylation is now regarded as a promising biomarker for the risk and progression of lung cancer. The one-carbon metabolism pathway is postulated to affect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation because it is responsible for the generation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for cellular methylation reactions. This study investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six one-carbon metabolism-related genes with promoter hypermethylation in sputum DNA from non-Hispanic white smokers in the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (LSC) (n = 907). Logistic regression was used to assess the association of SNPs with hypermethylation using a high/low methylation cutoff. SNPs in the cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR) genes were significantly associated with high methylation in males [CBS rs2850146 (-8283G &gt; C), OR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.98, 12.2, P = 0.0006] and low methylation in females [MTRR rs3776467 (7068A &gt; G), OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.77, P = 0.0003]. The variant allele of rs2850146 was associated with reduced gene expression and increased plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations. Three plasma metabolites, Hcy, methionine and dimethylglycine, were associated with increased risk for gene methylation. These studies suggest that SNPs in CBS and MTRR have sex-specific associations with aberrant methylation in the lung epithelium of smokers that could be mediated by the affected one-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration in the cells.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are rarely diagnosed in children younger than 2 years, because diagnosis is based entirely on behavioral tests. Oxidative damage may play a central role in this pathogenesis, together with the interconnected transmethylation cycle and transsulfuration pathway. In an attempt to clarify and quantify the relationship between oxidative stress-related blood biomarkers and ASDs, a systematic literature review was carried out. For each identified study, mean biomarker levels were compared in cases and controls providing a point estimate, the mean ratio, for each biomarker. After meta-analysis, the ASD patients showed decreased blood levels of reduced glutathione (27%), glutathione peroxidase (18%), methionine (13%), and cysteine (14%) and increased concentrations of oxidized glutathione (45%) relative to controls, whereas superoxide dismutase, homocysteine, and cystathionine showed no association with ASDs. For the C677T allele in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR), homozygous mutant subjects (TT) showed a meta-OR of 2.26 (95% CI 1.30-3.91) of being affected by ASD with respect to the homozygous nonmutant (CC). Case-control studies on blood levels of vitamins suggest a lack of association (folic acid and vitamin B12) or rare association (vitamins A, B6, C, D, E). Sparse results were available for other biomarkers (ceruloplasmin, catalase, cysteinylglycine, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, nitric oxide) and for polymorphisms in other genes. Existing evidence is heterogeneous and many studies are limited by small sample size and effects. In conclusion, existing evidence suggests a role for glutathione metabolism, the transmethylation cycle, and the transsulfuration pathway, although these findings should be interpreted with caution, and larger, more standardized studies are warranted.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that continuous exposure throughout gestation until the juvenile period to environmentally relevant doses of trichloroethylene (TCE) in the drinking water of MRL+/+ mice promoted adverse behavior associated with glutathione depletion in the cerebellum indicating increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to extend our findings and further characterize the impact of TCE exposure on redox homeostasis and biomarkers of oxidative stress in the hippocampus, a brain region prone to oxidative stress. Instead of a continuous exposure, the mice were exposed to water only or two environmentally relevant doses of TCE in the drinking water postnatally from birth until 6 weeks of age. Biomarkers of plasma metabolites in the transsulfuration pathway and the transmethylation pathway of the methionine cycle were also examined. Gene expression of neurotrophins was examined to investigate a possible relationship between oxidative stress, redox imbalance and neurotrophic factor expression with TCE exposure. Our results show that hippocampi isolated from male mice exposed to TCE showed altered glutathione redox homeostasis indicating a more oxidized state. Also observed was a significant, dose dependent increase in glutathione precursors. Plasma from the TCE treated mice showed alterations in metabolites in the transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways indicating redox imbalance and altered methylation capacity. 3-Nitrotyrosine, a biomarker of protein oxidative stress, was also significantly higher in plasma and hippocampus of TCE-exposed mice compared to controls. In contrast, expression of key neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus (BDNF, NGF, and NT-3) was significantly reduced compared to controls. Our results demonstrate that low-level postnatal and early life TCE exposure modulates neurotrophin gene expression in the mouse hippocampus and may provide a mechanism for TCE-mediated neurotoxicity.</p>

<p>Methionine and folate are the key components of one carbon metabolism, providing the methyl groups for numerous methyl transferase reactions via the ubiquitous methyl donor, s-adenosyl methionine. Methionine metabolism is responsive to nutrient intake, is regulated by several hormones and requires a number of vitamins (B12, pyridoxine, riboflavin) as co-factors. The critical relationship between perturbations in the mother’s methionine metabolism and its impact on fetal growth and development is now becoming evident. The relation of folate intake to fetal teratogenesis has been known for some time. Studies in human pregnancy show a continuous decrease in plasma homocysteine, and an increase in plasma choline concentrations with advancing gestation. A higher rate of transsulfuration of methionine in early gestation and of transmethylation in the 3rd trimester was seen in healthy pregnant women. How these processes are impacted by nutritional, hormonal and other influences in human pregnancy and their effect on fetal growth has not been examined. Isocaloric protein restriction in pregnant rats, resulted in fetal growth restriction and metabolic reprogramming. Isocaloric protein restriction in the non-pregnant rat, resulted in differential expression of a number of genes in the liver, a 50% increase in whole body serine biosynthesis and high rate of transmethylation, suggesting high methylation demands. These responses were associated with a significant decrease in intracellular taurine levels in the liver suggesting a role of cellular osmolarity in the observed metabolic responses. These unique changes in methionine and one carbon metabolism in response to physiological, nutritional and hormonal influences make these processes critical for cellular and organ function and growth.</p>

<p>Physiological roles of the transsulfuration pathway have been recognized by its contribution to the synthesis of cytoprotective cysteine metabolites, such as glutathione, taurine/hypotaurine, and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), whereas its roles in protecting against methionine toxicity remained to be clarified. This study aimed at revealing these roles by analyzing high-methionine diet-fed transsulfuration-defective cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase-deficient (Cth(-/-)) mice. Wild-type and Cth(-/-) mice were fed a standard diet (1 × Met: 0.44%) or a high-methionine diet (3 × Met or 6 × Met), and hepatic conditions were monitored by serum biochemistry and histology. Metabolome analysis was performed for methionine derivatives using capillary electrophoresis- or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and sulfur-detecting gas chromatography. The 6 × Met-fed Cth(-/-) (not 1 × Met-fed Cth(-/-) or 6 × Met-fed wild type) mice displayed acute hepatitis, which was characterized by markedly elevated levels of serum alanine/aspartate aminotransferases and serum/hepatic lipid peroxidation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hepatocyte ballooning; thereafter, they died of gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulation factor deficiency. After 1 week on 6 × Met, blood levels of ammonia/homocysteine and hepatic levels of methanethiol/3-methylthiopropionate (a methionine transamination product/methanethiol precursor) became significantly higher in Cth(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Although hepatic levels of methionine sulfoxide became higher in 6 × Met-fed wild-type mice and Cth(-/-) mice, those of glutathione, taurine/hypotaurine, and H(2)S became lower and serum levels of homocysteine became much higher in 6 × Met-fed Cth(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, transsulfuration plays a critical role in the detoxification of excessive methionine by circumventing aberrant accumulation of its toxic transamination metabolites, including ammonia, methanethiol, and 3-methylthiopropionate, in addition to synthesizing cysteine-derived antioxidants to counteract accumulated pro-oxidants such as methionine sulfoxide and homocysteine.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a well-known factor risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in obese patients.AIMS: To better understand the association between T2DM and NAFLD, global changes in protein expression in diabetic and non-diabetic obese subjects were assessed by a proteomic approach.METHODS: Liver samples were obtained from diabetic and non-diabetic morbid obese subjects (BMI&gt;40 kg/m(2) ). Histological analysis was used to evaluate hepatic steatosis and the degree of anatomopathological alteration. Changes in protein expression were analysed by two-dimentional electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Levels of glutathione, carbonyl and 4-HNE protein adducts were used to assess oxidative stress status.RESULTS: Of 850 proteins analysed, 33 were differentially expressed in T2DM obese subjects. Of these, 27 were unequivocally identified by mass spectrometry. Analysis of protein sets revealed patterns of decreased abundance in mitochondrial enzymes, proteins involved in methione metabolism, and oxidative stress response. Accordingly, T2DM subjects showed decreased levels of glutathione, the antioxidant byproduct of methionine metabolism via the transsulfuration pathway, and higher levels of protein and lipid oxidative damage. Changes in detoxyfing enzymes, carbohydrate metabolism, proteasome subunits and retinoic acid synthesis were also found.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest alterations in mitochondrial function and methionine metabolism as potential contributing factors to increased oxidative stress in liver of obese diabetic patients which may be influencing the development of NAFLD and NASH.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gaseous product generated by heme oxygenase (HO), which oxidatively degrades heme. While the stress-inducible HO-1 has well been recognized as an anti-oxidative defense mechanism under stress conditions, recent studies suggest that cancer cells utilize the reaction for their survival. HO-2, the constitutive isozyme, also plays protective roles as a tonic regulator for neurovascular function. Although protective roles of the enzyme reaction and CO have extensively been studied, little information is available on the molecular mechanisms by which the gas exerts its biological actions. Recent studies using metabolomics revealed that CO inhibits cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), which generates H(2)S, another gaseous mediator. The CO-dependent CBS inhibition may impact on the remethylation cycle and related metabolic pathways including the methionine salvage pathway and polyamine synthesis. This review focuses on the gas-responsive regulation of metabolic systems, particularly the remethylation and transsulfuration pathways, and their putative implications for cancer and ischemic diseases.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) have decreased glutathione levels and elevated homocysteine levels. These substances are considered markers of health, and an inverse relationship has been suggested through the transsulfuration pathway. This experiment tested the effects of exercise and B vitamin supplementation on homocysteine and glutathione levels, and if a relationship was present between these two markers in those with PD. Secondary aims included examining the impact of the interventions on aerobic efficiency and strength.METHODS: Thirty-six subjects were randomly assigned to 4 groups. The Vit group received vitamins B(6), B(12) and folic acid daily for 6 weeks. The Ex group received aerobic and strength training twice weekly for 6 weeks. The Vit + Ex group received both interventions. A control group received no intervention. Subjects were tested prior to and after intervention on the following measures: glutathione and homocysteine levels, strength measures and oxygen consumption.RESULTS: Subjects who received 6 weeks of B vitamin supplementation had lowered homocysteine levels. Subjects who received 6 weeks of exercise training had increased glutathione levels, strength and aerobic capacity. The combination of vitamin and exercise did not yield greater changes than the separate intervention. The control subjects did not change on any measures.CONCLUSION: Positive results were realized with each intervention; however, the expected relationship between glutathione and homocysteine was not found in this sample of subjects with PD. Homocysteine and glutathione levels can be improved independently in individuals with PD with exercise or vitamins B(6), B(12) and folic acid supplementation.</p>

<p>The integrated stress response mediated by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) phosphorylation maintains cellular homeostasis under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. eIF2a phosphorylation induces activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes responsible for amino acid metabolism, cellular redox state, and anti-stress responses. Cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase are critical enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway, which also regulate cellular redox status by modulating glutathione (GSH) levels. To determine the link between the integrated stress response and the transsulfuration pathway, we used homocysteine (Hcy) as an inducer of eIF2a phosphorylation and ATF4 gene induction. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking ATF4 (ATF4(-/-)) had reduced GSH levels and increased reactive oxygen species and were susceptible to apoptotic cell death under normal culture conditions. Further, ATF4(-/-) MEFs were more sensitive to Hcy-induced cytotoxicity and showed significantly reduced intracellular GSH levels associated with apoptosis. ATF4(-/-) MEFs could be rescued from l-Hcy-induced apoptosis by ß-mercaptoethanol medium supplementation that increases cysteine levels and restores GSH synthesis. ATF4(-/-) MEFs showed little or no CSE protein but did express cystathionine ß-synthase. Further, ER stress-inducing agents, including tunicamycin and thapsigargin, induced the expression of CSE in ATF4(+/+) MEFs. Consistent with ATF4(-/-) MEFs, CSE(-/-) MEFs showed significantly greater apoptosis when treated with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and l-Hcy, compared with CSE(+/+) MEFs. Liver and kidney GSH levels were also reduced in CSE(-/-) mice, suggesting that CSE is a critical factor in GSH synthesis and may act to protect the liver and kidney from a variety of conditions that cause ER stress.</p>

<p>The prevention of oxidation is an essential process in all cells, as decreased antioxidant protection may lead to cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. The mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to carcinogenesis include modulation of gene expression and induction of genetic modifications. Cellular methylation and antioxidant metabolism are linked by the transsulfuration pathway, which converts the methionine cycle intermediate, homocysteine, to cysteine, the limiting reagent in glutathione synthesis. Taurine can protect cells from oxidant-induced injury scavenging strong oxidant and cytotoxic agents, and lipoic acid can regenerate glutathione. N-acetylcysteine has anticancer properties such as counteractions against mutagens and prevention of tumor progression. The oxidizing agents react with the thiol group of these non enzymatic antioxidants determining cellular redox potential, and modulating several biological events, since different redox-sensitive molecules are involved in many cell responses such as proliferation, growth arrest, and death. The high metabolic activity characteristic of cancer cells often upregulates oxidative stress protection mechanisms. In fact, glutathione depletion is an early hallmark observed in apoptosis and it has been demonstrated as a common feature of cancer.</p>

<p>Abstract In transsulfuration reaction catalyzed by rat mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST), a stable persulfide is formed at the catalytic site cysteine Cys(247) as a reaction intermediate. The outer sulfur atom is donated by the substrate, thiosulfate, or by mercaptopyruvate. MST serves as a thioredoxin-dependent antioxidant possessing self-regulated enzymatic activity. After oxidation of persulfurated MST by treatment with hydrogen peroxide, mass spectrometric analysis showed that the outer sulfur atom of the persulfide is oxidized to form Cys-thiosulfenate (Cys-S<U+03B3>-SO(-)), Cys-thiosulfinate (Cys-S<U+03B3>-SO(2)(-)), and Cys-thiosulfonate (Cys-S<U+03B3>-SO(3)(-)). Next, sulfur acceptor substrates including reduced thioredoxin convert all modified cysteines to nonmodified cysteines. Another sulfur acceptor substrate, cyanide, also converted these cysteines via cyanolysis. Thus, sulfur oxides are suggested to release in the redox cycle of persulfide of MST.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Recent evidence shows that subjects diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have significantly lower levels of glutathione than typically developing children. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of two commonly used glutathione supplements in subjects diagnosed with an ASD to determine their efficacy in increasing blood glutathione levels in subjects diagnosed with an ASD.METHODS: The study was an eight-week, open-label trial using oral lipoceutical glutathione (n=13) or transdermal glutathione (n=13) in children, 3-13 years of age, with a diagnosis of an ASD. Subjects underwent pre- and post-treatment lab testing to evaluate plasma reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, cysteine, taurine, free and total sulfate, and whole-blood glutathione levels.RESULTS: The oral treatment group showed significant increases in plasma reduced glutathione, but not whole-blood glutathione levels following supplementation. Both the oral and transdermal treatment groups showed significant increases in plasma sulfate, cysteine, and taurine following supplementation.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that oral and transdermal glutathione supplementation may have some benefit in improving some of the transsulfuration metabolites. Future studies among subjects diagnosed with an ASD should further explore the pharmacokinetics of glutathione supplementation and evaluate the potential effects of glutathione supplementation upon clinical symptoms.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta synthase gene (CßS) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine, forming cystathionine by the transsulfuration pathway. Disruption of CßS enzyme activity due to defective folic acid metabolism increases the risk factor for neural tube defects. We evaluated the CßS gene mutation in 25 children with neural tube defects (NTDs), including lumbosacral and thoracic myelomeningocele and open NTDs and mothers of cases, along with 25 healthy children and their mothers, serving as controls. Genomic DNA was isolated to assess the polymorphism of 852Ins68 in the CßS gene using PCR-RFLP analysis and nucleotide sequencing techniques. The 68-bp insertion was observed in one of the 25 NTD cases (lumbosacral myelomeningocele), and in two of the mothers of NTD cases. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Fischer exact probability test, which showed a lack of significance (P &gt; 0.05), but the odds ratio of 2.08 with 95% confidence interval of 0.17-24.6 in NTDs mother was quite high because of the small sample size. However, the study was further extended to find out the involvement of specific nucleotide sequences, which again confirmed the 852Ins68 insertion and replacement of nucleotides (TCCAT to GGGG) in lumbosacral myelomeningocele (due to other category of NTDs), suggesting that it could be an independent risk factor for birth defects, including NTDs.</p>

First published September 20, 2011; 10.1152/ajpendo.00345.2011.-We carried out a (1)H-NMR metabolomic analysis of sera from vitamin B(12)-deficient rats. In addition to the expected increases in methylmalonate and homocysteine (Hcy), we observed an approximately sevenfold increase in formate levels, from 64 µM in control rats to 402 µM in vitamin B(12)-deficient rats. Urinary formate was also elevated. This elevation of formate could be attributed to impaired one-carbon metabolism since formate is assimilated into the one-carbon pool by incorporation into 10-formyl-THF via the enzyme 10-formyl-THF synthase. Both plasma and urinary formate were also increased in folate-deficient rats. Hcy was elevated in both the vitamin B(12)- and folate-deficient rats. Although plasma Hcy was also elevated, plasma formate was unaffected in vitamin B(6)-deficient rats (impaired transsulfuration pathway). These results were in accord with a mathematical model of folate metabolism, which predicted that reduction in methionine synthase activity would cause increased formate levels, whereas reduced cystathionine ß-synthase activity would not. Our data indicate that formate provides a novel window into cellular folate metabolism, that elevated formate can be a useful indicator of deranged one-carbon metabolism and can be used to discriminate between the hyperhomocysteinemia caused by defects in the remethylation and transsulfuration pathways.</p>

<p>The mechanisms through which dietary restriction enhances health and longevity in diverse species are unclear. The transsulfuration pathway (TSP) is a highly conserved mechanism for metabolizing the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine. Here we show that Drosophila cystathionine ß-synthase (dCBS), which catalyzes the rate-determining step in the TSP, is a positive regulator of lifespan in Drosophila and that the pathway is required for the effects of diet restriction on animal physiology and lifespan. dCBS activity was up-regulated in flies exposed to reduced nutrient conditions, and ubiquitous or neuron-specific transgenic overexpression of dCBS enhanced longevity in fully fed animals. Inhibition of the TSP abrogated the changes in lifespan, adiposity, and protein content that normally accompany diet restriction. RNAi-mediated knockdown of dCBS also limited lifespan extension by diet. Diet restriction reduced levels of protein translation in Drosophila, and we show that this is largely caused by increased metabolic commitment of methionine cycle intermediates to transsulfuration. However, dietary supplementation of methionine restored normal levels of protein synthesis to restricted animals without affecting lifespan, indicating that global reductions in translation alone are not required for diet-restriction longevity. Our results indicate a mechanism by which dietary restriction influences physiology and aging.</p>

<p>ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Danshensu is an active water-soluble component from Salvia Miltiorrhiza, which has been demonstrated holding multiple mechanisms for the regulation of cardiovascular system. However, the relative contribution of danshensu to its multiple cardiovascular activities remains largely unknown.AIM OF THE STUDY: To develop an artificial neural network (NN) model simultaneously characterizing danshensu pharmacokinetics and multiple cardiovascular activities in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rats. The relationship between danshensu pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) were evaluated using contribution values.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Danshensu was intraperitoneally injected at a single dose of 20mg/kg to AMI rats induced by coronary artery ligation. Plasma levels of danshensu, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), total homocysteine (Hcy) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were quantified. A back-propagation NN model was developed to characterize the PK and PD profiles of danshensu, in which the input variables contained time, area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of danshensu and rat weights (covariate). Relative contribution of input variable to the output neurons was evaluated using neuron connection weights according to Garson’s algorithm. The kinetics of contribution values was also compared and was validated using bootstrap resampling method.RESULTS: Danshensu exerted significant cTnT-lowering, Hcy- and GSH-elevating effect, and these marker profiles were well captured by the trained NN model. The calculation of relative contributions revealed that the effect of danshensu on the PD marker could be ranked as cTnT&gt;GSH&gt;Hcy, while the effect of AMI disease on the PD marker could be ranked in the following order: cTnT&gt;Hcy&gt;GSH. The activity of transsulfuration pathway was quite obvious under the AMI state.CONCLUSION: NN is a powerful tool linking PK and PD profiles of danshensu with multiple cardioprotective mechanisms, it provides a simple method for identifying and ranking relative contribution to the multiple therapeutic effects of the drug.</p>

<p>High homocysteine (HCY) levels are a risk factor for osteoporotic fracture. Furthermore, bone quality and strength are compromised by elevated HCY owing to its negative impact on collagen maturation. HCY is cleared by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), the first enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway. CBS converts HCY to cystathionine, thereby committing it to cysteine synthesis. A microarray experiment on MC3T3-E1 murine preosteoblasts treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2) D(3) ] revealed a cluster of genes including the cbs gene, of which the transcription was rapidly and strongly induced by 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) . Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed higher levels of cbs mRNA and protein after 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) treatment in murine and human cells. Moreover, measurement of CBS enzyme activity and quantitative measurements of HCY, cystathionine, and cysteine concentrations were consistent with elevated transsulfuration activity in 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) -treated cells. The importance of a functional vitamin D receptor (VDR) for transcriptional regulation of cbs was shown in primary murine VDR knockout osteoblasts, in which upregulation of cbs in response to 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) was abolished. Chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip and transfection studies revealed a functional vitamin D response element in the second intron of cbs. To further explore the potential clinical relevance of our ex vivo findings, human data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam suggested a correlation between vitamin D status [25(OH)D(3) levels] and HCY levels. In conclusion, this study showed that cbs is a primary 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) target gene which renders HCY metabolism responsive to 1,25(OH)(2) D(3).</p>

<p>Cysteine is a semi-indispensable AA in neonates and is synthesized from the indispensable AA, methionine, by transsulfuration. We previously showed that the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is a metabolically important site of methionine transsulfuration to cysteine, yet the metabolic fate of dietary cysteine in the GIT has not been established. Cysteine use by gut epithelial cells may play an important role for maintenance of glutathione synthesis and cellular redox function. Our aim was to quantify the extent of gastrointestinal first-pass cysteine metabolism in young pigs. Four-week-old weanling pigs (n = 10) were fed a liquid milk-replacer diet and given an intragastric and intravenous [1-(13)C]cysteine infusion on 2 separate days in a crossover design. Arterial and portal blood samples were collected for cysteine isotopic enrichment by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and for (13)CO(2) enrichment by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Our results indicated that dietary cysteine is metabolized during its first-pass splanchnic metabolism, accounting for about 40% of dietary cysteine intake. We also showed that intestinal absorption was the major metabolic fate of dietary cysteine, representing about 75% of intake, indicating that the GIT utilizes 25% of the dietary cysteine intake. Thus, utilization by the GIT represents about one-half (approximately 53%) of the first-pass, splanchnic uptake of dietary cysteine. Moreover, a substantial proportion of dietary splanchnic cysteine metabolism was consumed by the GIT via nonoxidative pathways. We conclude that the gut utilizes 25% of the dietary cysteine intake and that synthesis of mucosal epithelial proteins, such as glutathione and mucin, are a major nonoxidative metabolic fate for cysteine.</p>

<p>The paper contains short information concerning the role of folate-related processes in cell metabolism and multiple diseases which are characterized by hyperhomocysteinemia. The authors represent more detailed information about the folate-related processes in human placenta, namely about the content of aminothiols at different allelic variants of placental methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase during the course of physiological pregnancy and preeclampsia. The existing data concerning the expression and catalytic activity of corresponding enzymes are corroborated by the authors’ own results that proved for the first time the functional activity of transsulfuration pathway in human placenta. This pathway is activated in placental explants in parallel with down-regulation of proliferation and up-regulation of apoptosis when hyperhomocysteinemia is imitated by high concentration of homocysteine in culture medium. On the whole the presented data point to the importance of placental folate-related processes for its normal function.</p>

<p>Although methionine dependency is a phenotypic characteristic of tumor cells, it remains to be determined whether changes in sulfur amino acid metabolism occur in cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutic medications. We compared expression/activity of sulfur amino acid metabolizing enzymes and cellular levels of sulfur amino acids and their metabolites between normal MCF-7 cells and doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/Adr) cells. The S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, an index of transmethylation potential, in MCF-7/Adr cells decreased to ~10% relative to that in MCF-7 cells, which may have resulted from down-regulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. Expression of homocysteine-clearing enzymes, such as cystathionine beta-synthase, methionine synthase/methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, was up-regulated in MCF-7/Adr cells, suggesting that acquiring doxorubicin resistance attenuated methionine-dependence and activated transsulfuration from methionine to cysteine. Homocysteine was similar, which is associated with a balance between the increased expressions of homocysteine-clearing enzymes and decreased extracellular homocysteine. Despite an elevation in cysteine, cellular GSH decreased in MCF-7/Adr cells, which was attributed to over-efflux of GSH into the medium and down-regulation of the GSH synthesis enzyme. Consequently, MCF-7/Adr cells were more sensitive to the oxidative stress induced by bleomycin and menadione than MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that regulating sulfur amino acid metabolism may be a possible therapeutic target for chemoresistant cancer cells. These results warrant further investigations to determine the role of sulfur amino acid metabolism in acquiring anticancer drug resistance in cancer cells using chemical and biological regulators involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism.</p>

<p>The RP-HPLC method for a simultaneous separation and quantitation of the dinitrophenyl derivative of cystathionine (N,N’-di-DNP) in biological samples together with GSH, GSSG, cysteine and cystine, provides a very useful tool for investigation of the transsulfuration pathway in biological samples, at the same providing results which reflect the redox status (GSH/GSSG ratio) and the potential of the generation of H2S. An application of the method for the study of the process of transsulfuration in various human brain regions shows the presence of cystathionine in all the investigated regions; it also demonstrates that cystathionine levels vary greatly between particular regions. The highest level in the thalamus and the lowest in the cerebellum were associated with respectively a low or high <U+03B3>-cystathionase activity, and at the same time, a high cysteine and GSH level in the thalamus and a low value in the cerebellum. Based on the above results, one may suggest a regulatory mechanism responsible for inhibition of the CGL activity at high concentration values of cysteine and/or GSH. Simultaneous determinations of GSH and GSSG levels allow for determining the GSH/GSSG ratio, which reflects tissue redox status. The method may be also employed in determining the activity of <U+03B3>-cystathionase and cystathionine-ß synthase.</p>

<p>Environmental enteropathy has been identified as a cause of poor growth in children living in low-income countries, but a mechanism has not been well defined. We suggest changes in sulfur amino acid metabolism can in part explain the poor growth and possibly the histological changes in the small bowel, which is the hallmark of environmental enteropathy. In environments of poor sanitation, where infection is common, we propose increased oxidative stress drives methionine metabolism toward cystathionine synthesis. This “cystathionine siphon” limits sulfur amino acids from participating in critical protein synthesis pathways. Increased expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) could be one mechanism, as lipopolysaccharide and TNFa increase activity of this enzyme in vivo. CBS catalyzes the first of two steps in the transsulfuration pathway that converts homocysteine to cysteine. As enterocytes are one of the most rapidly proliferating cells in the body, we suggest diminished translation might also be important in the barrier failure observed in environmental enteropathy. Identifying sulfur amino acid metabolism as a mechanism leading to poor growth provides a new testable hypothesis for the undernutrition observed in children living in settings of poor sanitation.</p>

<p>Vitamin deficiencies are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Homocysteine (Hcys) is a thrombogenic amino acid produced from methionine (Met), and its increase in patients with IBD indicates a disruption of Met metabolism; however, the role of Hcys and Met metabolism in IBD is not well understood. We hypothesized that disrupted Met metabolism from a B-vitamin-deficient diet would exacerbate experimental colitis. Mice were fed a B(6)-B(12)-deficient or control diet for 2 wk and then treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. We monitored disease activity during DSS treatment and collected plasma and tissue for analysis of inflammatory tissue injury and Met metabolites. We also quantified Met cycle activity by measurements of in vivo Met kinetics using [1-(13)C-methyl-(2)H(3)]methionine infusion in similarly treated mice. Unexpectedly, we found that mice given the B-vitamin-deficient diet had improved clinical outcomes, including increased survival, weight maintenance, and reduced disease scores. We also found lower histological disease activity and proinflammatory gene expression (TNF-a and inducible nitric oxide synthase) in the colon in deficient-diet mice. Metabolomic analysis showed evidence that these effects were associated with deficient B(6), as markers of B(12) function were only mildly altered. In vivo methionine kinetics corroborated these results, showing that the deficient diet suppressed transsulfuration but increased remethylation. Our findings suggest that disrupted Met metabolism attributable to B(6) deficiency reduces the inflammatory response and disease activity in DSS-challenged mice. These results warrant further human clinical studies to determine whether B(6) deficiency and elevated Hcys in patients with IBD contribute to disease pathobiology.</p>

<p>Because hyperhomocysteinemia can occur in cholesterol gallstone disease, we hypothesized that this may result from trimethylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which partakes in biliary phosphatidylcholine (PC) hypersecretion during cholesterol cholelithogenesis. We fed murine strains C57L/J, C57BL/6J, SWR/J, AKR/J, PE N-methyltransferase (PEMT) knockout (KO), PEMT heterozygous (HET), and wildtype (WT) mice a cholesterol/cholic acid lithogenic diet (LD) for up to 56 days and documented biliary lipid phase transitions and secretion rates. We quantified plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), folate, and vitamin B12 in plasma and liver, as well as biliary tHcy and cysteine secretion rates. Rate-limiting enzyme activities of PC synthesis, PEMT and cytidine triphosphate: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (PCT), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were measured in liver homogenates. Other potential sources of plasma tHcy, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) and guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT), were assayed by gene expression. Plasma tHcy and PEMT activities became elevated during cholelithogenesis in gallstone-susceptible C57L, C57BL/6, and SWR mice but not in the gallstone-resistant AKR mice. Persisting in C57L mice, which exhibit the greatest Lith gene burden, these increases were accompanied by elevated hepatic SAM/SAH ratios and augmented biliary tHcy secretion rates. Counter-regulation included remethylation of Hcy to methionine concurrent with decreased folate and vitamin B12 levels and Hcy transsulfuration to cysteine. Concomitantly, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr), betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (Bhmt), and cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs) were up-regulated, but Gnmt and Gamt genes were down-regulated. PEMT KO and HET mice displayed biliary lipid secretion rates and high gallstone prevalence rates similar to WT mice without any elevation in plasma tHcy levels.</AbstractText>: Because hyperhomocysteinemia can occur in cholesterol gallstone disease, we hypothesized that this may result from trimethylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which partakes in biliary phosphatidylcholine (PC) hypersecretion during cholesterol cholelithogenesis.

<p>Methionine is a component of one-carbon metabolism and a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for DNA methylation. When methionine intake is high, an increase of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is expected. DNA methyltransferases convert SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). A high intracellular SAH concentration could inhibit the activity of DNA methyltransferases. Therefore, high methionine ingestion could induce DNA damage and change the methylation pattern of tumor suppressor genes. This study investigated the genotoxicity of a methionine-supplemented diet. It also investigated the diet’s effects on glutathione levels, SAM and SAH concentrations and the gene methylation pattern of p53. Wistar rats received either a methionine-supplemented diet (2% methionine) or a control diet (0.3% methionine) for six weeks. The methionine-supplemented diet was neither genotoxic nor antigenotoxic to kidney cells, as assessed by the comet assay. However, the methionine-supplemented diet restored the renal glutathione depletion induced by doxorubicin. This fact may be explained by the transsulfuration pathway, which converts methionine to glutathione in the kidney. Methionine supplementation increased the renal concentration of SAH without changing the SAM/SAH ratio. This unchanged profile was also observed for DNA methylation at the promoter region of the p53 gene. Further studies are necessary to elucidate this diet’s effects on genomic stability and DNA methylation.</p>

<p>Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disorders, which are major causes of mortality in this disease. Hyperhomocysteinemia, defined by high plasma homocysteine levels, is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Type 2 diabetic patients have higher circulating homocysteine levels than healthy subjects and these levels are even higher in plasma of obese than nonobese diabetic patients. Homocysteine metabolism that has been studied in 2 animal models of type 2 diabetes with obesity led to conflicting data. The aim of the present study was to analyze homocysteine metabolism in a spontaneous nonobese model of type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki rats at various successive and well characterized stages of the disease: during early postnatal normoglycemia, at the onset of hyperglycemia (around weaning), and during chronic mild hyperglycemia with progressive insulin resistance. Compared to age-matched Wistar controls, Goto-Kakizaki rats showed lower plasma levels of homocysteine and a falling trend in its major byproduct antioxidant, glutathione, from the prediabetic stage onwards. Concomitantly, Goto-Kakizaki rats exhibited increased liver activity of cystathionine beta synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine in the first step of the transsulfuration pathway. These results emphasize a strong association between homocysteine metabolism and insulin via the first step of the hepatic transsulfuration pathway in Goto-Kakizaki rats.</p>

<p>The diversity of reactions catalyzed by enzymes reliant on pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) demonstrates the catalytic versatility of this cofactor and the plasticity of the protein scaffolds of the major fold types of PLP-dependent enzymes. The enzymes of the transsulfuration (cystathionine <U+03B3>-synthase and cystathionine ß-lyase) and reverse transsulfuration (cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase) pathways interconvert l-cysteine and l-homocysteine, the immediate precursor of l-methionine, in plants/bacteria and yeast/animals, respectively. These enzymes provide a useful model system for investigation of the mechanisms of substrate and reaction specificity in PLP-dependent enzymes as they catalyze distinct side chain rearrangements of similar amino acid substrates. Exploration of the underlying factors that enable enzymes to control the substrate and reaction specificity of this cofactor will enable the engineering of these properties and the development of therapeutics and antimicrobial compounds. Recent studies probing the role of active-site residues, of the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways, as determinants of substrate and reaction specificity are the subject of this review.

<p>Methionine is the precursor for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major 1-carbon donor involved in &gt;100 transmethylation reactions. Homocysteine produced from SAM must be metabolized either by remethylation for recycling of methionine or transsulfuration to form cystathionine and then cysteine. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) serves as a coenzyme in enzymes involved in transsulfuration as well as for primary acquisition of 1-carbon units used for remethylation and other phases of 1-carbon metabolism. Because the intake of vitamin B-6 is frequently low in humans and metabolic consequences of inadequacy may be amplified in the postprandial state, we aimed to determine the effects of marginal vitamin B-6 deficiency on the postprandial rates of remethylation, transmethylation, overall transsulfuration, and cystathionine synthesis. Healthy, young adults (4 male, 5 female; 20-35 y) received a primed, constant infusion of [1-(13)C]methionine, [methyl-(2)H(3)]methionine, and [5,5,5-(2)H(3)]leucine to quantify in vivo kinetics at normal vitamin B-6 status and after a 28-d dietary vitamin B-6 restriction. Vitamin B-6 restriction lowered the plasma PLP concentration from 49 ± 4 nmol/L (mean ± SEM) to 19 ± 2 nmol/L (P &lt; 0.0001). Mean remethylation, transsulfuration, and transmethylation rates did not change in response to vitamin B-6 restriction; however, the responses to vitamin B-6 restriction varied greatly among individuals. The plasma cystathionine concentration increased from 142 ± 8 to 236 ± 9 nmol/L (P &lt; 0.001), whereas the fractional cystathionine synthesis rate increased by a mean of 12% in 8 of 9 participants. Interrelationships among plasma concentrations of glycine and cystathionine and kinetic results suggest that individual variability occurs in normal postprandial 1-carbon metabolism and in the response to vitamin B-6 restriction.</p>

<p>Glycine-N methyltransferase (GNMT) is a potential tumor suppressor that is commonly inactivated in human hepatoma. We systematically investigated how GNMT regulates methyl group kinetics and global DNA methylation. HepG2 cells (GNMT inactive, GNMT-) and cells transfected with GNMT expressed vector (GNMT+) were cultured in low (10 µmol/L), adequate (100 µmol/L), or high (500 µmol/L) l-methionine, each with 2.27 µmol/L folate. Transmethylation kinetics were studied using stable isotopic tracers and GC-MS. Methylation status was determined by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels, SAM:SAH ratio, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity, and methylated cytidine levels in DNA. Compared with GNMT- cells, GNMT+ cells had lower homocysteine and greater cysteine concentrations. GNMT expression increased methionine clearance by inducing homocysteine transsulfuration and remethylation metabolic fluxes when cells were cultured in high or adequate l-methionine. In contrast, homocysteine remethylation flux was lower in GNMT+ cells than in GNMT- cells and homocysteine transsulfuration fluxes did not differ when cells were cultured in low methionine, suggesting that normal GNMT function helps to conserve methyl groups. Furthermore, GNMT expression decreased SAM and increased SAH levels and reduced DNMT activity in high or adequate, but not low, methionine cultures. In low methionine cultures, restoring GNMT in HepG2 cells did not lead to sarcosine synthesis, which would waste methyl groups. Methylated cytidine levels were significantly lower in GNMT- cells than in GNMT+ cells. In conclusion, we have shown that GNMT affects transmethylation kinetics and SAM synthesis and facilitates the conservation of methyl groups by limiting homocysteine remethylation fluxes.</p>

<p>Astrocyte cells require cysteine as a substrate for glutamate cysteine ligase (<U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthase; EC 6.3.2.2) catalyst of the rate-limiting step of the <U+03B3>-glutamylcycle leading to formation of glutathione (L: -<U+03B3>-glutamyl-L: -cysteinyl-glycine; GSH). In both astrocytes and glioblastoma/astrocytoma cells, the majority of cysteine originates from reduction of cystine imported by the x (c) (-) cystine-glutamate exchanger. However, the transsulfuration pathway, which supplies cysteine from the indispensable amino acid, methionine, has recently been identified as a significant contributor to GSH synthesis in astrocytes. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the importance of the transsulfuration pathway in these cells, particularly in the context of a reserve pathway that channels methionine towards cysteine when the demand for glutathione is high, or under conditions in which the supply of cystine by the x (c) (-) exchanger may be compromised.</p>

<p>The evolution of the metabolism of sulfur compounds among yeast species was investigated. Differences between species were observed in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway. Most yeast species possess two pathways leading to cysteine production, the transsulfuration pathway and the O-acetyl-serine (OAS) pathway, with the exception of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata, which only display the transsulfuration pathway, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which only have the OAS pathway. An examination of the components of the regulatory network in the different species shows that it is conserved in all the species analyzed, as its central component Met4p was shown to keep its functional domains and its partners were present. The analysis of the presence of genes involved in the catabolic pathway shows that it is evolutionarily conserved in the sulfur metabolism and leads us to propose a role for two gene families which appeared to be highly conserved. This survey has provided ways to understand the diversity of sulfur metabolism products among yeast species through the reconstruction of these pathways. This diversity could account for the difference in metabolic potentialities of the species with a biotechnological interest.</p>

<p>The role of endogenously produced H(2)S in mediating varied physiological effects in mammals has spurred enormous recent interest in understanding its biology and in exploiting its pharmacological potential. In these early days in the field of H(2)S signaling, large gaps exist in our understanding of its biological targets, its mechanisms of action and the regulation of its biogenesis and its clearance. Two branches within the sulfur metabolic pathway contribute to H(2)S production: (i) the reverse transsulfuration pathway in which two pyridoxal 5’-phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase convert homocysteine successively to cystathionine and cysteine and (ii) a branch of the cysteine catabolic pathway which converts cysteine to mercaptopyruvate via a PLP-dependent cysteine aminotransferase and subsequently, to mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase-bound persulfide from which H(2)S can be liberated. In this review, we present an overview of the kinetics of the H(2)S-generating reactions, compare the structures of the PLP-enzymes involved in its biogenesis and discuss strategies for their regulation.

<p>This study examined the important relationship between cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) functionality and cysteine supply for normal growth and life span. Mice with a targeted deletion of the CSE gene (CSE-KO) were fed a cysteine-limited diet and their growth and survival patterns as well as levels of cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were measured. CSE-KO mice fed a cysteine-limited diet exhibited growth retardation; decreased levels of cysteine, glutathione, and H2S; and increased plasma homocysteine level. However, histological examinations of liver did not reveal any abnormality and plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and albumin were normal in these animals. No CSE-KO mice survived after 12 weeks of feeding with the cysteine-limited diet. Supplementation of H2S to the CSE-KO mice failed to reverse the aforementioned abnormalities. On the other hand, supplementation of cysteine in the drinking water of the CSE-KO mice significantly increased plasma cysteine and glutathione levels. This eventually led to an increase in body weight and rescued the animals from death. In conclusion, CSE is critical for cysteine biosynthesis through the transsulfuration pathway and the combination of CSE deficiency and lack of dietary cysteine supply would threaten life sustainability.</p>

<p>Although carbon monoxide derived from heme oxygenase has been reported to exert diverse biological actions in mammals, macromolecules responsible for its direct reception and functional outcomes of the gas binding remain largely unknown. Based on our previous results in vivo suggesting carbon monoxide serves as an inhibitor of cystathionine ß-synthase that rate-limits transsulfuration pathway for generation of hydrogen sulfide, we have herein hypothesized that the gas might serve as a regulator of protein methylation through accelerating turnover of remethylation cycle residing at the upstream of the enzyme. Metabolomic analysis in human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells in culture revealed that application of carbon monoxide-releasing molecules caused increases in methionine and S-adenosylmethionine and a decrease in cystathionine in the cells, suggesting the cystathionine ß-synthase inhibition by carbon monoxide. Under these circumstances, the cells exhibited global protein arginine methylation: this event was also reproduced by the cell treatment with hemin, a heme oxygenase-1 inducer. The protein arginine methylation elicited by carbon monoxide was attenuated by knocking down cystathionine ß-synthase with its small interfering RNA or by blocking S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase with adenosine dialdehyde, suggesting remethylation cycling is necessary to trigger the methylation processing. Furthermore, proteins undergoing the carbon monoxide-induced arginine methylation involved histone H3 proteins, suggesting chromatin modification by the gas. Collectively with our studies in vivo showing its inhibitory action on endogenous hydrogen sulfide production, the current results suggest that not only inhibition of transsulfuration pathway for H(2)S generation but also activation of protein methylation accounts for notable biological actions of carbon monoxide via the cystathionine ß-synthase inhibition.</p>

<p>Normal differentiated hepatocytes primarily metabolize methionine, via homocysteine synthesis, through the transsulfuration pathway. In addition to glutathione, this pathway produces a-ketobutyrate that is further metabolized in the mitochondria. It is only under low methionine conditions that differentiated hepatocytes predominantly regenerate methionine from homocysteine. In contrast, proliferating hepatocytes and liver cancer cells regenerate methionine from homocysteine regardless of the availability of methionine. Here we propose that this less efficient metabolism of methionine in proliferating hepatocytes and cancer cells is an adaptation to the “Warburg effect” that is, to the well known phenomenon that cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation to generate energy. The observation that knockout mice with impaired S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) synthesis (the first step in methionine metabolism) or catabolism spontaneously develop fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma, together with the observation that SAMe administration induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells and prevents liver cancer support this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), are important for the endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), a gaseous signaling molecule. The relative contributions of CBS and CSE to H(2)S generation in different tissues are not known. In this study, we report quantification of CBS and CSE in murine liver and kidney and their contribution to H(2)S generation in these tissues and in brain at saturating substrate concentrations. We show that CBS protein levels are significantly lower than those of CSE; 60-fold and 20-fold in liver and kidney, respectively. Each enzyme is more abundant in liver compared with kidney, twofold and sixfold for CBS and CSE, respectively. At high substrate concentrations (20 mM each cysteine and homocysteine), the capacity for liver H(2)S production is approximately equal for CBS and CSE, whereas in kidney and brain, CBS constitutes the major source of H(2)S, accounting for ~80% and ~95%, respectively, of the total output. At physiologically relevant concentrations of substrate, and adjusting for the differences in CBS versus CSE levels, we estimate that CBS accounts for only 3% of H(2)S production by the transsulfuration pathway enzymes in liver.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are critical for neuronal redox homeostasis providing them with cysteine needed for glutathione synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the astrocytic redox response signature provoked by amyloid beta (Aß) is distinct from that of a general oxidant (tertiary-butylhydroperoxide [t-BuOOH]). Acute Aß treatment increased cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) levels and enhanced transsulfuration flux in contrast to repeated Aß exposure, which decreased CBS and catalase protein levels. Although t-BuOOH also increased transsulfuration flux, CBS levels were unaffected. The net effect of Aß treatment was an oxidative shift in the intracellular glutathione/glutathione disulfide redox potential in contrast to a reductive shift in response to peroxide. In the extracellular compartment, Aß, but not t-BuOOH, enhanced cystine uptake and cysteine accumulation, and resulted in remodeling of the extracellular cysteine/cystine redox potential in the reductive direction. The redox changes elicited by Aß but not peroxide were associated with enhanced DNA synthesis. CBS activity and protein levels tended to be lower in cerebellum from patients with Alzheimer’s disease than in age-matched controls. Our study suggests that the alterations in astrocytic redox status could compromise the neuroprotective potential of astrocytes and may be a potential new target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>In this study, we combined metabolic reconstruction, growth assays, and metabolome and transcriptome analyses to obtain a global view of the sulfur metabolic network and of the response to sulfur availability in Brevibacterium aurantiacum. In agreement with the growth of B. aurantiacum in the presence of sulfate and cystine, the metabolic reconstruction showed the presence of a sulfate assimilation pathway, thiolation pathways that produce cysteine (cysE and cysK) or homocysteine (metX and metY) from sulfide, at least one gene of the transsulfuration pathway (aecD), and genes encoding three MetE-type methionine synthases. We also compared the expression profiles of B. aurantiacum ATCC 9175 during sulfur starvation or in the presence of sulfate. Under sulfur starvation, 690 genes, including 21 genes involved in sulfur metabolism and 29 genes encoding amino acids and peptide transporters, were differentially expressed. We also investigated changes in pools of sulfur-containing metabolites and in expression profiles after growth in the presence of sulfate, cystine, or methionine plus cystine. The expression of genes involved in sulfate assimilation and cysteine synthesis was repressed in the presence of cystine, whereas the expression of metX, metY, metE1, metE2, and BL613, encoding a probable cystathionine-<U+03B3>-synthase, decreased in the presence of methionine. We identified three ABC transporters: two operons encoding transporters were transcribed more strongly during cysteine limitation, and one was transcribed more strongly during methionine depletion. Finally, the expression of genes encoding a methionine <U+03B3>-lyase (BL929) and a methionine transporter (metPS) was induced in the presence of methionine in conjunction with a significant increase in volatile sulfur compound production.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first step in the transsulfuration pathway in mammals, i.e., the condensation of serine and homocysteine to produce cystathionine and water. Recently, we have reported a steady-state kinetic analysis of the three hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S)-generating reactions that are catalyzed by human and yeast CBS [Singh, S., et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 22457-22466]. In the study presented here, we report a pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of intermediates in the H(2)S-generating reactions catalyzed by yeast CBS (yCBS). Because yCBS does not have a heme cofactor, in contrast to human CBS, it is easier to observe reaction intermediates with yCBS. The most efficient route for H(2)S generation by yCBS is the ß-replacement of the cysteine thiol with homocysteine. In this reaction, yCBS first reacts with cysteine to release H(2)S and forms an aminoacrylate intermediate (k(obs) of 1.61 ± 0.04 mM(-1) s(-1) at low cysteine concentrations and 2.8 ± 0.1 mM(-1) s(-1) at high cysteine concentrations, at 20 °C), which has an absorption maximum at 465 nm. Homocysteine binds to the E·aminoacrylate intermediate with a bimolecular rate constant of 142 mM(-1) s(-1) and rapidly condenses to form the enzyme-bound external aldimine of cystathionine. The reactions could be partially rate limited by release of the products, cystathionine and H(2)S.</p>

<p>Methionine can be oxidized by reactive oxygen species to a mixture of two diastereomers, methionine-S-sulfoxide and methionine-R-sulfoxide. Both free amino acid and protein-based forms of methionine-S-sulfoxide are stereospecifically reduced by MsrA, whereas the reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide requires two enzymes, MsrB and fRMsr, which act on its protein-based and free amino acid forms, respectively. However, mammals lack fRMsr and are characterized by deficiency in the reduction of free methionine-R-sulfoxide. The biological significance of such biased reduction of methionine sulfoxide has not been fully explored. MsrA and MsrB activities decrease during aging, leading to accumulation of protein-based and free amino acid forms of methionine sulfoxide. Since methionine is an indispensible amino acid in human nutrition and a key metabolite in sulfur, methylation, and transsulfuration pathways, the consequences of accumulation of its oxidized forms require further studies. Finally, in addition to methionine, methylsulfinyl groups are present in various drugs and natural compounds, and their differential reduction by Msrs may have important therapeutic implications.</p>

<p>Beard, Bearden</p>
<p>Homocysteine (Hcy), a cardiovascular and neurovascular disease risk factor, is converted to hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) through the transsulfuration pathway. H(2)S has attracted considerable attention in recent years for many positive effects on vascular health and homeostasis. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is the first, and rate-limiting, enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway. Mutations in the CBS gene decrease enzymatic activity, which increases the plasma Hcy concentration, a condition called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). Animal models of CBS deficiency have provided invaluable insights into the pathological effects of transsulfuration impairment and of both mild and severe HHcy. However, studies have also highlighted the complexity of HHcy and the need to explore the specific details of Hcy metabolism in addition to Hcy levels per se. There has been a relative paucity of work addressing the dysfunctional H(2)S production in CBS deficiency that may contribute to, or even create, HHcy-associated pathologies. Experiments using CBS knockout mice, both homozygous (-/-) and heterozygous (+/-), have provided 15 years of new knowledge and are the focus of this review. These murine models present the opportunity to study a specific mechanism for HHcy that matches one of the etiologies in many human patients. Therefore, the goal of this review was to integrate and highlight the critical information gained thus far from models of CBS deficiency and draw attention to critical gaps in knowledge, with particular emphasis on the modulation of H(2)S metabolism. We include findings from human and animal studies to identify important opportunities for future investigation that should be aimed at generating new basic and clinical understanding of the role of CBS and transsulfuration in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease.</p>

<p>Homocysteine, a cardiovascular and neurocognitive disease risk factor, is converted to hydrogen sulfide, a cardiovascular and neuronal protectant, through the transsulfuration pathway. Given the damaging effects of free homocysteine in the blood and the importance of blood homocysteine concentration as a prognosticator of disease, we tested the hypotheses that the blood itself regulates homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism through transsulfuration and that transsulfuration capacity and hydrogen sulfide availability protect the endothelium from redox stress. Here we show that the transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, are secreted by microvascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes, circulate as members of the plasma proteome, and actively produce hydrogen sulfide from homocysteine in human blood. We further demonstrate that extracellular transsulfuration regulates cell function when the endothelium is challenged with homocysteine and that hydrogen sulfide protects the endothelium from serum starvation and from hypoxia-reoxygenation injury. These novel findings uncover a unique set of opportunities to explore innovative clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies in the approach to homocysteine-related conditions such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and dementia.</p>

<p>Lanthionine (Lan), the thioether analog of cystine, is a natural but nonproteogenic amino acid thought to form naturally in mammals through promiscuous reactivity of the transsulfuration enzyme cystathionine-beta-synthase (CbetaS). Lanthionine exists at appreciable concentrations in mammalian brain, where it undergoes aminotransferase conversion to yield an unusual cyclic thioether, lanthionine ketimine (LK; 2H-1,4-thiazine-5,6-dihydro-3,5-dicarboxylic acid). Recently, LK was discovered to possess neuroprotective, neuritigenic and anti-inflammatory activities. Moreover, both LK and the ubiquitous redox regulator glutathione (gamma-glutamyl-cysteine-glycine) bind to mammalian lanthionine synthetase-like protein-1 (LanCL1) protein which, along with its homolog LanCL2, has been associated with important physiological processes including signal transduction and insulin sensitization. These findings begin to suggest that Lan and its downstream metabolites may be physiologically important substances rather than mere metabolic waste. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about lanthionyl metabolites with emphasis on their possible relationships to LanCL1/2 proteins and glutathione. The potential significance of lanthionines in paracrine signaling is discussed with reference to opportunities for utilizing bioavailable pro-drug derivatives of these compounds as novel pharmacophores.</p>

<p>The synthesis of glutathione, a major cellular antioxidant with a critical role in T cell proliferation, is limited by cysteine. In this study, we evaluated the contributions of the x(C)(-) cystine transporter and the transsulfuration pathway to cysteine provision for glutathione synthesis and antioxidant defense in naïve versus activated T cells and in the immortalized T lymphocyte cell line, Jurkat. We show that the x(C)(-) transporter, although absent in naïve T cells, is induced after activation, releasing T cells from their cysteine dependence on antigen-presenting cells. We also demonstrate the existence of an intact transsulfuration pathway in naïve and activated T cells and in Jurkat cells. The flux through the transsulfuration pathway increases in primary but not in transformed T cells in response to oxidative challenge by peroxide. Inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway in both primary and transformed T cells decreases cell viability under oxidative-stress conditions.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Although abnormal hepatic methionine metabolism plays a central role in the pathogenesis of experimental alcoholic liver disease (ALD), its relationship to the risk and severity of clinical ALD is not known. The aim of this clinical study was to determine the relationship between serum levels of methionine metabolites in chronic alcoholics and the risk and pathological severity of ALD.METHODS: Serum levels of liver function biochemical markers, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine, methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine, alpha-aminobutyrate, glycine, serine, and dimethylglycine were measured in 40 ALD patients, of whom 24 had liver biopsies, 26 were active drinkers without liver disease, and 28 were healthy subjects.RESULTS: Serum homocysteine was elevated in all alcoholics, whereas ALD patients had low vitamin B6 with elevated cystathionine and decreased alpha-aminobutyrate/cystathionine ratios, consistent with decreased activity of vitamin B6 dependent cystathionase. The alpha-aminobutyrate/cystathionine ratio predicted the presence of ALD, while cystathionine correlated with the stage of fibrosis in all ALD patients.CONCLUSIONS: The predictive role of the alpha-aminobutyrate/cystathionine ratio for the presence of ALD and the correlation between cystathionine serum levels with the severity of fibrosis point to the importance of the homocysteine transsulfuration pathway in ALD and may have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.</p>

<p>In previous studies, exogenous ethanol (3 mmol EtOH/kg egg) caused a 1.6-fold increase in chick brain homocysteine (HoCys) levels at 11 days of development and the mixture of 3 mmol EtOH/kg egg and 34 micromol folic acid/kg egg attenuated EtOH-induced increases in chick brain HoCys levels. Because HoCys is converted to methionine utilizing the methyl donor, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl THF), we studied whether exogenous ethanol (3 mmol EtOH/kg egg) or the mixture of 3 mmol EtOH/kg egg and 34 micromol 5-methyl THF/kg egg inhibited chick brain 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (10-FTHF DH; EC 1.5.1.6) activities and brain N5, N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; EC 1.5.1.20) activities at 11 days of development. Three daily dosages of 3 mmol EtOH/kg egg (E0-2) caused approximately a 7-fold reduction in brain 10-FTHF DH activities and approximately a 1.9-fold reduction in brain MTHFR activities as compared to controls at 11 days of development (p&lt;or=0.05). Because HoCys is also removed by the transsulfuration pathway, which synthesizes taurine, we studied whether exogenous ethanol (3 mmol EtOH/kg egg) or the mixture of 3 mmol EtOH/kg egg and 34 micromol 5-methyl THF/kg egg influenced chick brain taurine levels. In EtOH-treated and EtOH and 5-methyl THF-treated embryos, brain taurine levels decreased by approximately 5.5-fold and 6.2-fold as compared to controls, respectively (p&lt;or=0.05). Exogenous 5-methyl THF failed to attenuate EtOH-induced decreased brain taurine levels at 11 days of development.</p>

<p>Arsenic is a nonmutagenic human carcinogen that induces tumors through unknown mechanisms. A growing body of evidence suggests that its carcinogenicity results from epigenetic changes, particularly in DNA methylation. Changes in gene methylation status, mediated by arsenic, have been proposed to activate oncogene expression or silence tumor suppressor genes, leading to long-term changes in the activity of genes controlling cell transformation. Mostly descriptive, and often contradictory, studies have demonstrated that arsenic exposure is associated with both hypo- and hyper-methylation at various genetic loci in vivo or in vitro. This ambiguity has made it difficult to assess whether the changes induced by arsenic are causally involved in the transformation process or are simply a reflection of the altered physiology of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Here, we discuss the evidence supporting changes in DNA methylation as a cause of arsenic carcinogenesis and highlight the strengths and limitations of these studies, as well as areas where consistencies and inconsistencies exist.</p>

Our study has shown the activation of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation, destruction of placental trophoblast and activation of the transsulfuration pathway under elevated homocysteine level in the incubation medium in the range of 20-80 microM. The activation of the transsulfuration pathway indicates that placenta may to some extent withstand elevated homocysteine level.</p>

<p>Human placenta is an active metabolic organ. It defines a final set of quantitative and qualitative substances, transferred to the fetus. In view of high level of obstetric complications in Ukraine, in particular, preeclampsia, anemia, etc., we have undertaken a study of folate-dependent metabolism in human placenta. Disturbances of folate-dependent metabolism are considered as causes of pregnancy complications. Investigations carried out on 38 samples of term placenta, obtained after physiological pregnancy, and 58 samples obtained after pregnancy with wide-spread complications typical of Ukraine. We have estimated the level of folate, components of methionine cycle–methionine and homocysteine, and related with methionine cycle cysteine and glutathione and polymorphism of methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methyl-enetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which serves as supplier of methyl group for methionine cycle. We have revealed, that C677T and T677T genotypes of MTHFR are represented more frequently in the samples from complicated pregnancies. In the samples-carriers of C/T genotype of MTHFR and in the group with complicated pregnancies the content of aminothiols and folates correlate in different directions with homocysteine level which serves as a marker of folate-dependent methionine cycle and related processes. On the basis of possitive correlation between homocysteine and cysteine in all investigated groups with different genotypes and the presence/absence of obstetrical complication we suggest the existence of transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine in the human placenta.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common and complex neurodevelopmental conditions. Diagnostic criteria for these conditions have traditionally relied solely on behavioral criteria without consideration for potential biomedical underpinnings. Newer evidence, however, reveals that ASDs are associated with: oxidative stress; decreased methylation capacity; limited production of glutathione; mitochondrial dysfunction; intestinal dysbiosis; increased toxic metal burden; immune dysregulation, characterized by a unique inflammatory bowel disease and immune activation of neuroglial cells; and ongoing brain hypoperfusion. Many of these same problems are common features in children with ADHD. These medical conditions, whether co-morbidities or etiopathogenic, would be expected to have synergistically negative effects on the development, cognition, focus, and attention of affected children. It is likely these biological abnormalities contribute significantly to the behavioral symptoms intrinsic in these diagnoses. However, treatment for these underlying medical disorders is clinically justified, even if no clear immediate behavioral improvements are observed. This article reviews the medical literature and discusses the authors clinical experience using various biomarkers for measuring oxidative stress, methylation capacity and transsulfuration, immune function, gastrointestinal problems, and toxic metal burden. These biomarkers provide useful guides for selection, efficacy, and sufficiency of biomedical interventions. The use of these biomarkers is of great importance in young children with ADHD or individuals of any age with ASD, because typically they cannot adequately communicate regarding their symptoms.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of L-serine and L-homocysteine to form L-cystathionine in the first step of the reverse transsulfuration pathway. Residue N84 of yeast CBS (yCBS), predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl moiety of the PLP cofactor, was mutated to alanine, aspartate and histidine. The truncated form of yCBS (ytCBS, residues 1-353) was employed in this study to eliminate any effects of the C-terminal, regulatory domain. The kcat/KmL-Ser of the N84A, N84D and N84H mutants for the beta-replacement reaction is reduced by a factor of 230, 11000 and 640, respectively. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residue(s) of the enzyme and the PLP cofactor, observed in the wild-type enzyme and N84A mutant, is altered in N84H and absent in N84D. PLP saturation values of 73%, 30% and 67% were observed for the alanine, aspartate and histidine mutants, respectively, compared to 98% for the wild-type enzyme. A marginal beta-elimination activity was detected for N84D (kcat/KmL-Ser=0.23+/-0.02 M(-1) s(-1)) and N84H (kcat/KmL-Ser=0.34+/-0.06 M(-1) s(-1)), in contrast with wild-type ytCBS and the N84A mutant, which do not catalyze this reaction. The ytCBS-N84D enzyme is also inactivated upon incubation with L-serine, via an aminoacrylate-mediated mechanism. These results demonstrate that residue N84 is essential in maintaining the orientation of the pyridine ring of the PLP cofactor and the equilibrium between the open and closed conformations of the active site.</p>

<p>Synthesis of cysteine as a product of the transsulfuration pathway can be viewed as part of methionine or homocysteine degradation, with cysteine being the vehicle for sulfur conversion to end products (sulfate, taurine) that can be excreted in the urine. Transsulfuration is regulated by stimulation of cystathionine ß-synthase and inhibition of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase in response to changes in the level of S-adenosylmethionine, and this promotes homocysteine degradation when methionine availability is high. Cysteine is catabolized by several desulfuration reactions that release sulfur in a reduced oxidation state, generating sulfane sulfur or hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which can be further oxidized to sulfate. Cysteine desulfuration is accomplished by alternate reactions catalyzed by cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. Cysteine is also catabolized by pathways that require the initial oxidation of the cysteine thiol by cysteine dioxygenase to form cysteinesulfinate. The oxidative pathway leads to production of taurine and sulfate in a ratio of approximately 2:1. Relative metabolism of cysteine by desulfuration versus oxidative pathways is influenced by cysteine dioxygenase activity, which is low in animals fed low-protein diets and high in animals fed excess sulfur amino acids. Thus, desulfuration reactions dominate when cysteine is deficient, whereas oxidative catabolism dominates when cysteine is in excess. In rats consuming a diet with an adequate level of sulfur amino acids, about two thirds of cysteine catabolism occurs by oxidative pathways and one third by desulfuration pathways. Cysteine dioxygenase is robustly regulated in response to cysteine availability and may function to provide a pathway to siphon cysteine to less toxic metabolites than those produced by cysteine desulfuration reactions.</p>

<p>In many bacteria, LuxS functions as a quorum-sensing molecule synthase. However, it also has a second, more central metabolic function in the activated methyl cycle (AMC), which generates the S-adenosylmethionine required by methyltransferases and recycles the product via methionine. Helicobacter pylori lacks an enzyme catalyzing homocysteine-to-methionine conversion, rendering the AMC incomplete and thus making any metabolic role of H. pylori LuxS (LuxS(Hp)) unclear. Interestingly, luxS(Hp) is located next to genes annotated as cysK(Hp) and metB(Hp), involved in other bacteria in cysteine and methionine metabolism. We showed that isogenic strains carrying mutations in luxS(Hp), cysK(Hp), and metB(Hp) could not grow without added cysteine (whereas the wild type could), suggesting roles in cysteine synthesis. Growth of the DeltaluxS(Hp) mutant was restored by homocysteine or cystathionine and growth of the DeltacysK(Hp) mutant by cystathionine only. The DeltametB(Hp) mutant had an absolute requirement for cysteine. Metabolite analyses showed that S-ribosylhomocysteine accumulated in the DeltaluxS(Hp) mutant, homocysteine in the DeltacysK(Hp) mutant, and cystathionine in the DeltametB(Hp) mutant. This suggests that S-ribosylhomocysteine is converted by LuxS(Hp) to homocysteine (as in the classic AMC) and thence by CysK(Hp) to cystathionine and by MetB(Hp) to cysteine. In silico analysis suggested that cysK-metB-luxS were acquired by H. pylori from a Gram-positive source. We conclude that cysK-metB-luxS encode the capacity to generate cysteine from products of the incomplete AMC of H. pylori in a process of reverse transsulfuration. We recommend that the misnamed genes cysK(Hp) and metB(Hp) be renamed mccA (methionine-to-cysteine-conversion gene A) and mccB, respectively.</p>

<p>A key unresolved question in the pathogenesis of phenotype development in nephropathic cystinosis is whether intralysosomal cystine, the hallmark of this lethal inborn error of metabolism, alters cytoplasmic redox potential. Variable findings on this issue have been reported. This study of fetal and non-fetal skin and lung-derived cystinotic fibroblasts compared to origin and age-matched normal control fibroblasts reveals that cystinotic cells do not exhibit redox perturbations. We find that the steady-state redox status as assessed by the [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio, an indicator of the intracellular redox poise, is unchanged in cystinotic cells. Furthermore, the dependence of the intracellular GSH and cysteine pool sizes and the [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio are similarly dependent on the two major sources of cysteine, i.e. the transsulfuration pathway and the plasma membrane cystine transporter, xc(-), in both cystinotic and control cells, and the presence of lysosomal cystine has no measurable effect on the redox status of these cells. Hence, mechanisms other than cytosolic redox perturbations are involved in the etiology of nephropathic cystinosis.</p>

<p>Cancer cells have a high demand for cysteine as precursor of the antioxidant, glutathione, that is required to promote cell growth and division. Uptake of cystine by the x(c)(-) cystine-glutamate exchanger provides the majority of cysteine, but a significant percentage may be derived from methionine, via a transsulfuration pathway. Our aim was to evaluate the relative contribution of the exchanger and the transsulfuration pathway to glutathione synthesis in astrocytoma/glioblastoma cells, using the C6 glioma cell line as a model system. Blockade of the x(c)(-) exchanger with the gliotoxins l-alphaaminoadipate or l-beta-N-oxalylamino-l-alanine (400 microM) caused a loss of cellular cysteine and depletion in glutathione to 51% and 54% of control, respectively, after 24 h. Inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway with propargylglycine (1 mM, 24 h) depleted glutathione to 77% of control. Co-incubation of cells with gliotoxin and propargylglycine reduced glutathione to 39% of control at 24 h and to 20% at 48 h. Expression of cystathionine-gamma-lyase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway, was significantly increased following incubation of the cells with gliotoxins. Incubation of C6 cells with diethylmaleate for 3 h led to a significant reduction in glutathione (63%), whereas expression of cystathionine-gamma-lyase was increased by 1.5-fold. Re-feeding methionine to diethylmaleate-treated cells incubated in the absence of cystine or methionine resulted in a significant recovery in glutathione that was blocked by propargylglycine. Co-incubation of C6 cells with diethylmaleate and the JNK-inhibitor, SP600125, abolished the increase in expression of cystathionine-gamma-lyase that had been observed in the presence of diethylmaleate alone. Similar results were obtained with the p38(MAPK) inhibitor, SB203580. It is concluded that glutathione depletion causes a JNK- and p38(MAPK)-mediated increase in expression of cystathionine-gamma-lyase that promotes flux through the transsulfuration pathway to compensate for loss of glutathione in C6 glioma cells.</p>

This study was aimed to find out whether chronic pancreatitis (CP) is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and derangements of transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways.METHODS: We estimated homocysteine and its metabolites in 45 alcoholic CP patients, 45 tropical CP patients, and 48 healthy controls.RESULTS: Significant increases in plasma total homocysteine and decreases in red blood cell folate, reduced glutathione, plasma methionine, cysteine, and urinary inorganic sulfate/creatinine ratio were observed in both alcoholic and tropical CP patients in comparison with healthy controls. Red blood cell glutathione and plasma cysteine levels were significantly lower in alcoholic than in tropical CP patients. However, plasma vitamin B12 levels were comparable between CP patients and controls. No significant differences in these parameters were observed between diabetic patients and nondiabetic patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between homocysteine and folate (r = -0.415, P = 0.001) and a positive correlation between glutathione and cysteine levels (r = 0.37, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pancreatitis is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and derangements in transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways. Low folate levels observed in these patients seem to have a key role in this derangement.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for a variety of human diseases. Homocysteine is formed from methionine and has two primary metabolic fates: remethylation to form methionine or commitment to the transsulfuration pathway by the action of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). We have examined the metabolic response in mice of a shift from a methionine-replete to a methionine-free diet.METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that shifting 3-mo-old C57BL6 mice to a methionine-free diet caused a transient increase in tHcy and an increase in the tHcy/methionine ratio. Because CBS is a key regulator of tHcy, we examined CBS protein levels and found that within 3 d on the methionine-deficient diet, animals had a 50% reduction in the levels of liver CBS protein and enzyme activity. Examination of CBS mRNA and studies of transgenic animals that express CBS from a heterologous promoter indicated that this reduction is occurring post-transcriptionally. Loss of CBS protein was unrelated to intracellular levels of S-adenosylmethionine, a known regulator of CBS activity and stability.CONCLUSION: Our results imply that methionine deprivation induces a metabolic state in which methionine is effectively conserved in tissue by shutdown of the transsulfuration pathway by an S-adenosylmethionine-independent mechanism that signals a rapid downregulation of CBS protein.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid derived from the metabolism of methionine, an essential amino acid, and is metabolized by one of two pathways: remethylation or transsulfuration. Abnormalities of these pathways lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is observed in approximately 5% of the general population and is associated with an increased risk for many disorders, including vascular and neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, birth defects, diabetes, renal disease, osteoporosis, neuropsychiatric disorders, and cancer. We review here the correlation between homocysteine metabolism and the disorders described above with genetic variants on genes coding for enzymes of homocysteine metabolism relevant to clinical practice, especially common variants of the MTHFR gene, 677C&gt;T and 1298A&gt;C. We also discuss the management of hyperhomocysteinemia with folic acid supplementation and fortification of folic acid and the impact of a decrease in the prevalence of congenital anomalies and a decline in the incidence of stroke mortality.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia during pregnancy, which is a consequence of perturbations in methionine and/or folate metabolism, has been implicated in adverse outcomes such as neural tube defects, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery. The adaptive changes in methionine metabolism during pregnancy in humans have not been determined.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the kinetics of methionine and its rate of transsulfuration and transmethylation in healthy women with advancing gestation.DESIGN: The whole-body rate of appearance (Ra) of methionine and phenylalanine was measured in healthy pregnant women during the first (n = 10), second (n = 5), and third (n = 10) trimesters of pregnancy. These data were compared with those for nonpregnant women (n = 8). Tracers [1-(13)C]methionine, [C(2)H(3)]methionine, and [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine were administered as prime-constant rate infusions. The effect of enteral high-protein, mixed-nutrient load on tracer-determined variables was also examined.RESULTS: In pregnant women, the Ra of phenylalanine was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in the first trimester than in the second and third trimesters and was significantly lower than that in nonpregnant women. A linear positive correlation was evident between gestational age and phenylalanine Ra. The fractional rate and total rate of transsulfuration of methionine was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher during the first trimester, whereas the rate of transmethylation was higher during the third trimester. Plasma concentrations of total cysteine and homocysteine were lower during pregnancy.CONCLUSIONS: Uncomplicated pregnancy in humans is associated with a higher rate of transsulfuration early in gestation and a higher rate of transmethylation of methionine in late gestation. These data may have implications for understanding the role of methionine and homocysteine in complications of pregnancy and for the nutritional care of pregnant women.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin deficiency is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data on B(6) supply and possible relationships to cardiovascular events (CVE) in CKD are rare. Pyridoxamine exerts inhibitory effects on the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD and atherosclerosis.METHODS: In 48 CKD patients at stage 2-4, 72 hemodialysis patients (HD), 38 renal transplant recipients (RTR) and 141 healthy controls (mean age 58 +/- 13, 61 +/- 12, 50 +/- 12 and 54 +/- 16 years, respectively), plasma and red blood cell (RBC) concentrations of pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal (PL), 4-pyridoxic acid (PA), pyridoxamine-5’-phosphate (PMP) and of the AGE pentosidine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine and imidazolone by an ELISA, and total homocysteine and cystathionine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.RESULTS: Despite routine low-dose vitamin supplementation in HD, plasma PLP was decreased in HD (79 +/- 69 nmol/l) compared with CKD stage 2-4 patients (497 +/- 944 nmol/l), RTR (416 +/- 604 nmol/l) and controls (159 +/- 230 nmol/l; p &lt; 0.001). Plasma PA was significantly increased in HD (11,667 +/- 17,871 nmol/l) in comparison with CKD stage 2-4 (435 +/- 441 nmol/l), RTR (583 +/- 668 nmol/l) and controls (46 +/- 49 nmol/l; p &lt; 0.001). B(6) forms were significantly affected by renal function (R = 0.792, p &lt; 0.001 for CKD stage 2-4). There was no relation of vitamers with a history of CVE. Relationships between B(6) forms and AGE (RBC-PMP with pentosidine in CKD stage 2-4: R = -0.351, p &lt; 0.05) were found.CONCLUSION: HD patients showed a deficiency in PLP in plasma but not in RBC. Prospective trials are needed to elucidate the potential role of elevated PA on cardiovascular and renal outcome in CKD. Vitamin B(6) supplementation might be successful in preventing AGE-related pathologies.</p>

<p>Increases in plasma concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy) have recently been reported in multiple sclerosis (MS) as the alteration of the methionine cycle for the onset of autoimmune diseases. Homocysteine (Hcy) and cysteine (Cys) are generated by the methionine cycle and transsulfuration reactions. Their plasma levels are subjected to complex redox changes by oxidation and thiol/disulfide (SH/SS) exchange reactions regulated by albumin. The methionine loading test (MLT) is a useful in vivo test to assay the functionality of the methionine cycle and transsulfuration reactions. Time courses of redox species of Cys, cysteinylglycine (CGly), Hcy, and glutathione have been investigated in plasma of MS patients versus healthy subjects after an overnight fasting, and 2, 4, and 6 h after an oral MLT (100 mg/kg body weight), to detect possible dysfunctions of the methionine cycle, transsulfuration reactions and alterations in plasma distribution of redox species. After fasting, the MS group showed a significant increase in cysteine-protein mixed disulfides (bCys) and total Cys (tCys). While plasma bCys and tCys in MS group remained elevated after methionine administration when compared to control, cystine (oxCys) increased significantly with respect to control. Although increased plasma concentrations of bCys and tCys at fasting might reflect an enhance of transsulfuration reactions in MS patients, this was not confirmed by the analysis of redox changes of thiols and total thiols after MLT. This study has also demonstrated that albumin-dependent SH/SS exchange reactions are a potent regulation system of thiol redox species in plasma.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is an intermediate in methionine synthesis in Aspergillus nidulans, but it can also be converted to cysteine by the reverse transsulfuration pathway involving cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL). Because homocysteine is toxic to the cell at high concentrations, this pathway also functions as a means of removal of its excess. We found that the transcription of the mecA and mecB genes encoding CBS and CGL was upregulated by excess of homocysteine as well as by shortage of cysteine. Homocysteine induced transcription of both genes when added to the growth medium or overproduced in a regulatory mutant. The derepressing effect of cysteine shortage was observed in some mutants and in the wild-type strain during sulfur starvation. An increase in the level of mecA or mecB transcript roughly parallel with the elevation of the respective enzyme activity. On the basis of the mode of mecA and mecB regulation by homocysteine, these genes may be classified in a group of genes upregulated directly or indirectly by this amino acid. We call this group of genes the “homocysteine regulon”.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is increasing at an alarming rate, especially in developing countries, such as India. It is often advocated that a vegetarian lifestyle could reduce the burden of CAD. However, in spite of a majority of Indians being vegetarians, the incidence of CAD is highest in this population. This may be due to deficiency of vitamin B12, a micronutrient, sourced only from animal products.METHODS: Herein, we assessed the effect of vitamin B12 with respect to CAD in 816 individuals (368 CAD patients and 448 controls) recruited from a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India.RESULTS: We found that vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in CAD patients than in controls (p&lt;0.0001). Also, vegetarians were found to have significantly lower vitamin B12 concentrations (p=0.0001) and higher incidence of CAD (p=0.01). Interestingly, elevated homocysteine levels, a hallmark of vitamin B12 deficiency, was not associated with CAD. In contrast, cysteine levels were significantly higher in CAD patients than in controls (p=0.004).CONCLUSIONS: We believe that, when vitamin B12 is deficient, homocysteine is rapidly metabolized via the transsulfuration pathway leading to increased cysteine levels.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is an endogenous sulphydryl aminoacid irreversibly catabolized by transsulfuration to cysteine or remethylated to methionine. Increased plasma levels of homocysteine are an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Accurate and reliable quantification of this amino acid in plasma samples is essential in clinical practice to explore the presence of a hyperhomocysteinemia, for instance after an ischemic event, or to control a possible adjunctive risk factor in patients at higher risk. In this review, LC-ESI-MS/MS methods are discussed and compared with other analytical methods for plasma homocysteine. LC-ESI-MS/MS is a technique combining the physicochemical separation of liquid chromatography with the analysis of mass spectrometry. It is based on stable-isotope dilution and possesses inherent accuracy and precision. Quantitative analysis is achieved by using commercially available homocystine-d(8) as an internal standard. Taking advantage of the high sensitivity and specificity, approaches involving LC-ESI-MS/MS require less laborious sample preparation, no derivatization and produce reliable results.</p>

<p>Lipoic acid is a disulfhydryl-containing compound used in clinical medicine and in experimental models as an antioxidant. We developed a stable isotope dilution capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry assay for lipoic acid. We assayed a panel of the metabolites of transmethylation and transsulfuration 30 min after injecting 100 mg/kg lipoic acid in a rat model. Lipoic acid values rose 1000-fold in serum and 10-fold in liver. A methylated metabolite of lipoic acid was also detected but not quantitated. Lipoic acid injection caused a massive increase in serum S-adenosylhomocysteine and marked depletion of liver S-adenosylmethionine. Serum total cysteine was depleted but liver cysteine and glutathione were maintained. Serum total homocysteine doubled, with increases also in cystathionine, N,N-dimethylglycine, and alpha-aminobutyric acid. In contrast, after injection of 2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid, serum total cysteine and homocysteine were markedly depleted and there were no effects on serum S-adenosylmethionine or S-adenosylhomocysteine. We conclude that large doses of lipoic acid displace sulfhydryls from binding sites, resulting in depletion of serum cysteine, but also pose a methylation burden with severe depletion of liver S-adenosylmethionine and massive release of S-adenosylhomocysteine. These changes may have previously unrecognized deleterious effects that should be investigated in both human disease and experimental models.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is the only reaction that removes homocysteine from methionine cycle and redirects it to the transsulfuration pathway. The c.[833T&gt;C;844_845ins68] mutation in the CBS gene has been reported initially as corresponding to classic homocystinuria. Studies showing that the insertion is associated with very smalls amounts of the transcript in the nucleus; others suggest that the heterozygous and homozygous subjects are protected against hyperhomocysteinemia and that the insertion tends to rescue the protein function. The liver is the major organ which metabolizes the circulating homocysteine to cystathionine. We have determined the sequence of the liver mRNA corresponding to the CBS c.[833T&gt;C;844_845ins68] gene. We have shown that a novel splicing event could account for the modification in protein and possibly in enzyme activity.</p>

<p>During the last decade much important new information relating to the metabolic pathway from methionine to homocysteine has been gained. Interest has been stimulated by the discovery of two novel disorders, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency. Another disorder in this pathway, methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, has been increasingly detected, thanks to the expansion of newborn screening programmes by tandem mass spectrometry technology. These significant steps allow important insight into the pathogenesis of these three disorders, as well as into the mechanisms of damage to various organs (liver, brain, muscle) and point to the relevance of these disorders for crucial biological processes such as methylation, transsulfuration or carcinogenesis in mammals, the pathogenesis of numerous pathological conditions, in particular those associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia, the action and possible toxicity of some drugs or consequences of nutritional variations. This review summarizes current knowledge of three inherited disorders in this metabolic pathway and draws attention to their much broader significance for human health and understanding of important biological processes.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), the first enzyme of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, catalyzes the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate-dependent condensation of &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine and &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-homocysteine to form &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-cystathionine (&lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Cth). A model of the &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Cth complex of the truncated form of yeast CBS (ytCBS), comprising the catalytic core, was constructed to identify residues involved in the binding of &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-homocysteine and the distal portion of &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Cth. Residue K112 was selected for site-directed mutagenesis based on the results of the in silico docking of &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Cth to the modeled structure of ytCBS. Residues E136, H138, Y248, and D249 of ytCBS were also targeted as they correspond to identical polar residues lining the mouth of the active site in the structure of human CBS. A series of 8 site-directed mutants was constructed, and their order of impact on the ability of ytCBS to catalyze the beta-replacement reaction is G247S asymptotically equal to K112Q &gt; K112L asymptotically equal to K112R &gt; Y248F &gt; D249A asymptotically equal to H138F &gt; E136A. The beta-replacement activity of G247S, which corresponds to the homocystinuria-associated G307S mutant of human CBS, is undetectable. The Km&lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Ser of the K112L and K112R mutants is increased by 50- and 90-fold, respectively, while Km&lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Hcys increases by only 2- and 4-fold, respectively. The Km&lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Hcys of H138F and Y248F is increased by 8- and 18-fold, respectively. These results indicate that, while the targeted residues are not direct determinants of &lt;span class=“smallcap”&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-Hcys binding, G307, Y248, and K112 play essential roles in the maintenance of appropriate active-site conformation.</p>

<p>AIMS: Transmethylation reactions and antioxidant metabolism are linked by transsulfuration, where homocysteine (Hcy) is converted to cysteine and reduced glutathione (GSH). Low protein intake can modulate the balance of this metabolic reaction. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of a low-protein diet on Hcy metabolism by monitoring levels of the amino acids involved in these pathways, and relating these levels to GSH levels and lipid peroxidation in rats.METHODS: Sixteen rats were divided into 2 groups: control (C; standard AIN-93 diet, 20% protein) and low-protein diet (LPD; 8% protein diet). Rats in both groups were placed on the diets for 28 days.RESULTS: A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in plasma Hcy concentration was found in LPD rats (0.16 +/- 0.04 micromol/mg protein) versus C rats (0.25 +/- 0.03 micromol/mg protein). Methionine levels were not significantly different between the 2 groups (C: 1.24 +/- 0.22 micromol/mg protein; LPD: 1.03 +/- 0.27 micromol/mg protein). A significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in hepatic GSH concentrations (C: 44 +/- 10 micromol/mg protein; LPD: 17.4 +/- 4.3 micromol/mg protein) was accompanied by an increase in lipid peroxidation (C: 0.13 +/- 0.01 micromol/mg protein; LPD: 0.17 +/- 0.02 micromol/mg protein; r = -0.62, p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: Hcy levels were reduced under a low-protein diet, resulting in modulated methyl balance and reduced GSH formation leading to increased susceptibility of hepatic cells to oxidative events.</p>

<p>Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the transsulfuration pathway for the metabolism of homocysteine (Hcy) in the kidney. Our recent study demonstrates that ischemia-reperfusion reduces the activity of CBS leading to Hcy accumulation in the kidney, which in turn contributes to renal injury. CBS is also capable of catalyzing the reaction of cysteine with Hcy to produce hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), a gaseous molecule that plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of ischemia-reperfusion on CBS-mediated H(2)S production in the kidney and to determine whether changes in the endogenous H(2)S generation had any impact on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The left kidney of Sprague-Dawley rat was subjected to 45-min ischemia followed by 6-h reperfusion. The ischemia-reperfusion caused lipid peroxidation and cell death in the kidney. The CBS-mediated H(2)S production was decreased, leading to a significant reduction in the renal H(2)S level. The activity of cystathionine-gamma-lyase, another enzyme responsible for endogenous H(2)S generation, was not significantly altered in the kidney upon ischemia-reperfusion. Partial restoration of CBS activity by intraperitoneal injection of the nitric oxide scavenger, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide not only increased renal H(2)S levels but also alleviated ischemia-reperfusion-induced lipid peroxidation and reduced cell damage in the kidney tissue. Furthermore, administration of an exogenous H(2)S donor, NaHS (100 microg/kg), improved renal function. Taken together, these results suggest that maintenance of tissue H(2)S level may offer a renal protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: To develop a mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model to characterize and predict the bidirectional effect of danshensu on plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) in rats described in our previous paper.METHODS: The effect of danshensu on tHcy was assessed in rats after simultaneously methionine loading. Danshensu, its methylated metabolite and tHcy were all quantified after single intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg danshensu. The bidirectional effect, of which, elevated by danshensu methylation and decreased via transsulfuration promotion, was characterized by a PK-PD model, where direct stimulatory sigmoidal function and time-dependent transduction function were introduced for the two effects description, respectively.RESULTS: Modeling and simulations reveals that: (1) the elevated effect by methylation occurs before the decreased effect via transsulfuration promotion, and the decreased effect is more profoundly dose-dependent than the elevated effect; (2) two steps are simplified to describe the delayed stimulatory effect on the transsulfuration in the model; (3) long term administration of danshensu dose not affect tHcy in normal rats, while it significantly reduces tHcy in rats treated with methionine. This is in consistent with previous report.CONCLUSIONS: The profiles were well-described by our PK-PD model, which constitutes a basis for the future development of mechanism-based model for polyphenols on Hcy in this paradigm.</p>

<p>AIMS: Oxidative stress via generation of reactive oxygen species is suggested to be the major mechanism of alcohol-induced liver injury. We investigated the effects of glutathione peroxidase-1 and catalase double deficiency (Gpx-1(-/-)/Cat(-/-)) on liver injury and changes in the sulfur amino acid metabolism induced by binge ethanol administration.METHODS: Ethanol (5 g/kg) was administered orally to the wild-type and the Gpx-1(-/-)/Cat(-/-) mice every 12 h for a total of three doses. Mice were sacrificed 6 h after the final dose.RESULTS: The Gpx-1/Cat deficiency alone increased malondialdehyde levels in liver significantly. Hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) activity and S-adenosylmethionine levels were decreased, however, glutathione contents were not changed. Ethanol administration to the Gpx-1(-/-)/Cat(-/-) mice increased the elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase activity, plasma homocysteine levels, hepatic fat accumulation and lipid peroxidation compared with the wild-type animals challenged with ethanol. Also the reduction of MAT activity and S-adenosylmethionine levels was enhanced, but MATI/III expression was increased significantly.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that Gpx-1 and Cat have critical roles in the protection of liver against binge ethanol exposure. Augmentation of ethanol-induced oxidative stress may be responsible for the impairment of the transsulfuration reactions and the aggravation of acute liver injury in the Gpx-1(-/-)/Cat(-/-) mice.</p>

<p>Cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) and cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL), which comprise the transsulfuration pathway of bacteria and plants, and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL), the second enzyme of the fungal and animal reverse transsulfuration pathway, share approximately 30% sequence identity and are almost indistinguishable in overall structure. One difference between the active site of Escherichia coli CBL and those of E. coli CGS and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CGL is the replacement of a pair of aromatic residues, F55 and Y338, of the former by acidic residues in CGS (D45 and E325) and CGL (E48 and E333). A series of interconverting, site-directed mutants of these 2 residues was constructed in CBL (F55D, Y338E, F55D/Y338E), CGS (D45F, E325Y and D45F/E325Y) and CGL (E48A,D and E333A,D,Y) to probe the role of these residues as determinants of reaction specificity. Mutation of either position results in a reduction in catalytic efficiency, as exemplified by the 160-fold reduction in the kcat/KmL-Cys of eCGS-D45F and the 2850- and 30-fold reductions in the kcat/KmL-Cth of the eCBL-Y338E and the yCGL-E333A,Y mutants, respectively. However, the in vivo reaction specificity of the mutants was not altered, compared with the corresponding wild-type enzymes. The DeltametB and DeltametC strains, the optimized CBL and CGL assay conditions, and the efficient expression and affinity purification systems described provide the necessary tools to enable the continued exploration of the determinants of reaction specificity in the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways.</p>

<p>The effects of exogenous ethanol and/or folic acid on endogenous homocysteine (HoCys) and SAM (S-adenosylmethionine)/SAH (S-adenosylhomocysteine) levels in chick brains were studied at 11 days of development. Embryonic EtOH (3.0 mmol/kg egg) exposure caused a 1.6-fold increase in brain HoCys levels and a 9-fold decrease in brain SAM/SAH levels as compared to controls (p&lt;or=0.05). Brain HoCys and SAM/SAH levels returned to control values when injected with a mixture of EtOH and folic acid (3.0 mmol EtOH/kg egg and 34 mumol folic acid/kg egg). The effects of exogenous EtOH on the remethylation pathway, as measured by 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (10-FTHF DH) activities, and the transsulfuration pathway, as measured by taurine levels, were studied at 18 days of development. A single dosage of EtOH (3.0 mmol/kg egg; E(0)) and two daily dosages of EtOH (E(0-1)) failed to influence brain and hepatic 10-FTHF DH activities when compared to controls. However, three daily dosages of EtOH (E(0-2)) caused approximately a two-fold increase in brain 10-FTHF DH activities and a three-fold increase in hepatic 10-FTHF DH activities as compared to controls (p&lt;or=0.05). Three daily EtOH dosages (E(0-2)) caused reduced taurine levels in both brain and hepatic tissues (p&lt;or=0.05). Meanwhile, a single EtOH dosage (E(0)), two daily EtOH dosages (E(0-1)), and three daily EtOH dosages (E(0-2)), caused reduced hepatic taurine levels as compared to controls (p&lt;or=0.05).</p>

<p>We recently showed that the developing gut is a significant site of methionine transmethylation to homocysteine and transsulfuration to cysteine. We hypothesized that sulfur amino acid (SAA) deficiency would preferentially reduce mucosal growth and antioxidant function in neonatal pigs. Neonatal pigs were enterally fed a control or an SAA-free diet for 7 days, and then whole body methionine and cysteine kinetics were measured using an intravenous infusion of [1-(13)C;methyl-(2)H(3)]methionine and [(15)N]cysteine. Body weight gain and plasma methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and taurine and total erythrocyte glutathione concentrations were markedly decreased (-46% to -85%) in SAA-free compared with control pigs. Whole body methionine and cysteine fluxes were reduced, yet methionine utilization for protein synthesis and methionine remethylation were relatively preserved at the expense of methionine transsulfuration, in response to SAA deficiency. Intestinal tissue concentrations of methionine and cysteine were markedly reduced and hepatic levels were maintained in SAA-free compared with control pigs. SAA deficiency increased the activity of methionine metabolic enzymes, i.e., methionine adenosyltransferase, methionine synthase, and cystathionine beta-synthase, and S-adenosylmethionine concentration in the jejunum, whereas methionine synthase activity increased and S-adenosylmethionine level decreased in the liver. Small intestine weight and protein and DNA mass were lower, whereas liver weight and DNA mass were unchanged, in SAA-free compared with control pigs. Dietary SAA deficiency induced small intestinal villus atrophy, lower goblet cell numbers, and Ki-67-positive proliferative crypt cells in association with lower tissue glutathione, especially in the jejunum. We conclude that SAA deficiency upregulates intestinal methionine cycle activity and suppresses epithelial growth in neonatal pigs.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of l-serine and l-homocysteine to form l-cystathionine in the first step of the reverse transsulfuration pathway. Residue S289 of yeast CBS, predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the pyridine nitrogen of the PLP cofactor, was mutated to alanine and aspartate. The k(cat)/K(m)(l-Ser) of the S289A mutant is reduced by a factor of approximately 800 and the beta-replacement activity of the S289D mutant is undetectable. Fluorescence energy transfer between tryptophan residue(s) of the enzyme and the PLP cofactor, observed in the wild-type enzyme and diminished in the S289A mutant, is absent in S289D. These results demonstrate that residue S289 is essential in maintaining the properties and orientation of the pyridine ring of the PLP cofactor. The reduction in activity of ytCBS-S289A suggests that ytCBS catalyzes the alpha,beta-elimination of l-Ser via an E1cB mechanism.</p>

<p>Although there is a growing recognition of the significance of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) as a biological signaling molecule involved in vascular and nervous system functions, its biogenesis and regulation are poorly understood. It is widely assumed that desulfhydration of cysteine is the major source of H(2)S in mammals and is catalyzed by the transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). In this study, we demonstrate that the profligacy of human CSE results in a variety of reactions that generate H(2)S from cysteine and homocysteine. The gamma-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of homocysteine, yields H(2)S and a novel biomarker, homolanthionine, which has been reported in urine of homocystinuric patients, whereas a beta-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of cysteine, generates lanthionine. Kinetic simulations at physiologically relevant concentrations of cysteine and homocysteine, reveal that the alpha,beta-elimination of cysteine accounts for approximately 70% of H(2)S generation. However, the relative importance of homocysteine-derived H(2)S increases progressively with the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia, and under conditions of severely elevated homocysteine (200 microm), the alpha,gamma-elimination and gamma-replacement reactions of homocysteine together are predicted to account for approximately 90% of H(2)S generation by CSE. Excessive H(2)S production in hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to the associated cardiovascular pathology.</p>

<p>In this section, I explore the effects of mercury and inflammation on transsulfuration reactions, which can lead to elevations in androgens, and how this might relate to the male preponderance of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is known that mercury interferes with these biochemical reactions and that chronically elevated androgen levels also enhance the neurodevelopmental effects of excitotoxins. Both androgens and glutamate alter neuronal and glial calcium oscillations, which are known to regulate cell migration, maturation, and final brain cytoarchitectural structure. Studies have also shown high levels of DHEA and low levels of DHEA-S in ASD, which can result from both mercury toxicity and chronic inflammation. Chronic microglial activation appears to be a hallmark of ASD. Peripheral immune stimulation, mercury, and elevated levels of androgens can all stimulate microglial activation. Linked to both transsulfuration problems and chronic mercury toxicity are elevations in homocysteine levels in ASD patients. Homocysteine and especially its metabolic products are powerful excitotoxins. Intimately linked to elevations in DHEA, excitotoxicity and mercury toxicity are abnormalities in mitochondrial function. A number of studies have shown that reduced energy production by mitochondria greatly enhances excitotoxicity. Finally, I discuss the effects of chronic inflammation and elevated mercury levels on glutathione and metallothionein.</p>

<p>Human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first irreversible step in the transsulfuration pathway and commits homocysteine to the synthesis of cysteine. Mutations in CBS are the most common cause of severe hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia. A yeast two-hybrid approach to screen for proteins that interact with CBS had previously identified several components of the sumoylation pathway and resulted in the demonstration that CBS is a substrate for sumoylation. In this study, we demonstrate that sumoylation of CBS is enhanced in the presence of human polycomb group protein 2 (hPc2), an interacting partner that was identified in the initial yeast two-hybrid screen. When the substrates for CBS, homocysteine and serine for cystathionine generation and homocysteine and cysteine for H(2)S generation, are added to the sumoylation mixture, they inhibit the sumoylation reaction, but only in the absence of hPc2. Similarly, the product of the CBS reaction, cystathionine, inhibits sumoylation in the absence of hPc2. Sumoylation in turn decreases CBS activity by approximately 28% in the absence of hPc2 and by 70% in its presence. Based on these results, we conclude that hPc2 serves as a SUMO E3 ligase for CBS, increasing the efficiency of sumoylation. We also demonstrate that gamma-cystathionase, the second enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway is a substrate for sumoylation under in vitro conditions. We speculate that the role of this modification may be for nuclear localization of the cysteine-generating pathway under conditions where nuclear glutathione demand is high.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying the impact of pathophysiological elevations in insulin or glucose on hepatic cellular homocysteine kinetics is not fully understood.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the impact of elevated insulin/glucose on hepatic homocysteine kinetics at the cellular level.DESIGN AND METHODS: Effects of insulin and glucose on homocysteine remethylation and transsulfuration metabolic fluxes were investigated in a cell model using stable isotopic tracers and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The methylation status was assessed by S-adenosylmethionine (adoMet), the adoMet to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, DNA methyltransferase activity, and methylated cytidine content of DNA. The expression profile of homocysteine remethylation, transmethylation, and transsulfuration-associated genes was determined.RESULTS: Insulin increased cellular homocysteine production primarily by its inhibition of transsulfuration. When cells were exposed to elevated insulin and glucose, homocysteine remethylation was enhanced, which consequently increased intracellular adoMet concentrations by inducing adoMet synthase activity. Elevated glucose further enhanced DNA methyltransferase activity that subsequently led to increased global DNA methylation.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the novel finding of a direct promoting effect of high cellular insulin or glucose exposure on homocysteine remethylation, adoMet synthase activity, and adoMet synthesis. We also provided new evidence indicating that when hepatic tissue is exposed to elevated insulin or glucose, the cellular methylation balance can be altered, which may have potential epigenetic impacts gene regulation in diabetic individuals. These findings in a cell line may or may not reflect what happens in humans. In vivo studies on the homocysteine transmethylation fluxes and DNA methylation in diabetic state are underway.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a stress-inducible gas generated by heme oxygenase (HO) eliciting adaptive responses against toxicants; however, mechanisms for its reception remain unknown. Serendipitous observation in metabolome analysis in CO-overproducing livers suggested roles of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) that rate-limits transsulfuration pathway and H(2)S generation, for the gas-responsive receptor. Studies using recombinant CBS indicated that CO binds to the prosthetic heme, stabilizing 6-coordinated CO-Fe(II)-histidine complex to block the activity, whereas nitric oxide (NO) forms 5-coordinated structure without inhibiting it. The CO-overproducing livers down-regulated H(2)S to stimulate HCO(3) (-)-dependent choleresis: these responses were attenuated by blocking HO or by donating H(2)S. Livers of heterozygous CBS knockout mice neither down-regulated H(2)S nor exhibited the choleresis while overproducing CO. In the mouse model of estradiol-induced cholestasis, CO overproduction by inducing HO-1 significantly improved the bile output through stimulating HCO(3) (-) excretion; such a choleretic response did not occur in the knockout mice.</AbstractText>: Carbon monoxide (CO) is a stress-inducible gas generated by heme oxygenase (HO) eliciting adaptive responses against toxicants; however, mechanisms for its reception remain unknown.

<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver is involved in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and chronic liver injury. Impairment of hepatic transsulfuration reactions is suggested to be critically linked with alcoholic liver injury, but its role in nonalcoholic fatty liver remains unknown. We examined the early changes in sulfur-amino acid metabolism and their implication in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Male rats were provided with a standard liquid diet or a high-fat liquid diet (HF) for 3 wk. An additional group of rats received the HF diet supplemented with betaine (1%). HF diet intake elevated hepatic triglyceride and serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) concentrations. Antioxidant capacity of liver cytosol against hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals was reduced significantly. Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and glutathione (GSH) decreased, but hypotaurine and taurine concentrations increased. Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) activity, not its concentration, was depressed, whereas both activity and concentration of cysteine dioxygenase and GSH S-transferase were elevated. Betaine supplementation of the HF diet inhibited hepatic fat accumulation and serum TNFalpha elevation. The decrease in cytosolic antioxidant capacity was also prevented. MAT activity and its concentration were induced significantly. Hepatic SAM and GSH increased and elevation of hypotaurine and taurine was depressed. The results indicate that the metabolism of S-containing substances is significantly disturbed by the HF diet, suggesting a causal role of impairment of hepatic transsulfuration reactions in NAFLD. Betaine supplementation protects the liver from nonalcoholic steatosis and oxidative stress most probably via its effects on the transsulfuration reactions.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Metabolic abnormalities and targeted treatment trials have been reported for several neurobehavioral disorders but are relatively understudied in autism.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether or not treatment with the metabolic precursors, methylcobalamin and folinic acid, would improve plasma concentrations of transmethylation/transsulfuration metabolites and glutathione redox status in autistic children.DESIGN: In an open-label trial, 40 autistic children were treated with 75 microg/kg methylcobalamin (2 times/wk) and 400 microg folinic acid (2 times/d) for 3 mo. Metabolites in the transmethylation/transsulfuration pathway were measured before and after treatment and compared with values measured in age-matched control children.RESULTS: The results indicated that pretreatment metabolite concentrations in autistic children were significantly different from values in the control children. The 3-mo intervention resulted in significant increases in cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and glutathione concentrations (P &lt; 0.001). The oxidized disulfide form of glutathione was decreased and the glutathione redox ratio increased after treatment (P &lt; 0.008). Although mean metabolite concentrations were improved significantly after intervention, they remained below those in unaffected control children.CONCLUSION: The significant improvements observed in transmethylation metabolites and glutathione redox status after treatment suggest that targeted nutritional intervention with methylcobalamin and folinic acid may be of clinical benefit in some children who have autism. This trial was registered at (clinicaltrials.gov) as NCT00692315.</p>

<p>This paper reports, for the first time, a quantitative replacement of methionine (Met) by selenomethionine (SeMet) at &gt;98% substitution, with up to 4940 microg of SeMet/g of yeast obtained for the entire protein pool of a wild-type yeast grown on a SeMet-containing medium. The incorporation of selenium in yeast proteins, in the form of selenomethionine, and the influence of various organic and inorganic Se and S sources present in the media were monitored during the growth of a wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which allowed the optimization of the composition of a fully defined synthetic growth medium that ensured maximum SeMet incorporation. Quantitation of SeMet and Met was performed by species-specific isotope dilution GC-MS. The use of ascorbic acid and a minimum concentration of cysteine (5 microg/L) was found to be beneficial to achieve incorporation by limiting the oxidative stress due to the presence of selenium. Except for small amounts of cysteine, no other sources of sulfur were necessary to achieve yeast growth. In a medium containing Se(VI), the maximum replacement of Met with SeMet was 50%, which is considerably higher than that obtained with the current commercial Se yeast formulations. For yeast grown in a Met-free defined medium, which was supplemented with SeMet, nearly total replacement of Met with SeMet could be achieved. The fully Se-labeled yeast could be an important tool for the study of eukaryotic protein structures both by mass spectrometry and by X-ray crystallography through selenomethionine single- and multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD and MAD) phasing. In addition, a particular yeast strain, BY4741, that cannot synthesize Met using inorganic sulfur (met15Delta0) was shown to produce SeMet in the presence of inorganic selenium. This might indicate that the incorporation of inorganic selenium salts [Se(VI) and Se(IV)] is obviously not occurring exclusively through the same biological pathways as for sulfur. The reduction of inorganic Se to hydrogen selenide (H(2)Se), its reactions with organic compounds present in the yeast or in the media, and the possible metabolization through unspecific enzymatic pathways (such as transsulfuration) could also be of considerable importance in the production of selenoamino acids during yeast growth.</p>

<p>The effects of low, moderate and severe oxidative stress on the steady-state levels of the metabolites involved in the transmethylation/transsulfuration pathway were studied in lung epithelial (A549) cells. When cells were exposed to low (0.1 mM) or moderate (1.0 mM) concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-butOOH), intracellular levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were significantly decreased, while the SAM/SAH ratio remained the same or elevated. Likewise, extracellular levels of SAM and SAH metabolites remained steady or elevated. Both intracellular and extracellular levels of homocyst(e)ine and cyst(e)ine were decreased. Cell contents of serine, cystathionine and methionine were also decreased. Total intracellular glutathione content was decreased only by moderate t-butOOH exposure. When cells were exposed to high concentrations (10mM) of either of the peroxides, extracellular levels of methionine, cystathionine, and total cyst(e)ine were depleted, mostly due to direct oxidation of sulfur amino acids by peroxides, as indicated by oxidative treatment of culture media alone. Similar to low and moderate oxidative conditions, the levels of SAM, SAH, and sulfur amino acids were decreased, while cell SAM/SAH ratio increased. Paradoxically, under high peroxide exposure, extracellular concentrations of SAM, SAH, and cyst(e)ine were increased, indicating cellular release, despite the severe methionine depletion. Intracellular total glutathione was also decreased. The results indicate that lung epithelial cells release high levels of SAM, probably as an adaptive response to increased oxidative stress, even when the substrate for SAM formation, methionine, is critically depleted.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the pyridoxal-50-phosphate-dependent condensation of L-serine and L-homocysteine to form L-cystathionine in the first step of the transsulfuration pathway. Although effective expression systems for recombinant human CBS (hCBS) have been developed, they require multiple chromatographic steps as well as proteolytic cleavage to remove the fusion partner. Therefore, a series of five expression constructs, each incorporating a 6-His tag, were developed to enable the efficient purification of hCBS via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Two of the constructs express hCBS in fusion with a protein partner, while the others bear only the affinity tag. The addition of an amino-terminal, 6-His tag, in the absence of a protein fusion partner and in the absence or presence ofa protease-cleavable linker, was found to be sufficient for the purification of soluble hCBS and resulted in enzyme with 86-91% heme saturation and with activity similar to that reported for other hCBS expression constructs. The continuous assay for L-Cth production, employing cystathionine beta-lyase and L-lactate dehydrogenase as coupling enzymes, was employed here for the first time to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters of hCBS, via global analysis, and revealed previously unreported substrate inhibition by L-Hcys (K(i)(L-HCYS) = 2.1 +/- 0.2 mM). The kinetic parameters for the hCBS-catalyzed hydrolysis of L-Cth toL-Ser and L-Hcys were also determined and the k(cat)/K(m)(L-CTH) of this reaction is only approximately 2-fold lower than the k(cat)/K(m)(L-SER) of the physiological, condensation reaction.</p>

<p>Elevated levels of homocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine are causal risk factors for several neurological disorders. Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing, nonproteinogenic, neurotoxic amino acid biosynthesized during methyl cycles after demethylation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and subsequent hydrolysis of SAH into homocysteine and adenosine. PC12 pheochromocytoma cells expressing a dominant inhibitory mutant of Ha-ras (M-M17-26, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells expressing a mutant v-ras gene (MVR) and PC12 cells transfected with normal c-rasH (M-CR3B) has been used to investigate the role of nitrosylation and farnesylation of Ras on the production of homocysteine and the activities of the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-kB and c-Fos. We found that under serum and nerve growth factor withdrawal conditions undifferentiated apoptotic M-CR3B cells accumulated more homocysteine, than M-M17-26 cells and the production of homocysteine decreased under the action of manumycin (inhibitor of farnesyltransferase) and increased in the presence of L-NAME (inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase). Furthermore, we have shown that manumycin increased the activity of c-Fos in the M-CR3B cells and decreased the activity of NF-kB, while L-NAME reduced the activities of both transcription factors, and accelerated apoptosis of M-CR3B cells. In contrast to the M-CR3B cells, in M-M17-26 cells manumycin did not change the activity of c-Fos or the activity of NF-kB. Moreover, we have shown that L-NAME significantly changes the SAM/SAH ratio in both MCR and MVR cells. Moreover, these alterations have reciprocal character; in the MCR cells, the SAM/SAH ratio was raised, whereas in the MVR cells this ratio was reduced. We conclude that trophic factor withdrawal stimulates Ras, which apparently through the Rac/NADPH oxidase system induces permanent oxidative stress, modulates the activities of NF-kB and c-Fos, induces production of homocysteine and accelerates apoptosis. Nitrosylation of Ras is necessary for maintaining the survival of PC12 cells, while farnesylation of Ras stimulates apoptosis under withdrawal conditions. Besides, our results suggest that in conditions of a low level of nitric oxide PC12 cells with mutated oncogenic Ras produce more ROS than cells with wild type Ras and switch homocysteine metabolism toward to transsulfuration.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may result from a combination of genetic/biochemical susceptibilities in the form of a reduced ability to excrete mercury and/or increased environmental exposure at key developmental times. Urinary porphyrins and transsulfuration metabolites in participants diagnosed with an ASD were examined. A prospective, blinded study was undertaken to evaluate a cohort of 28 participants with an ASD diagnosis for Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) scores, urinary porphyrins, and transsulfuration metabolites. Testing was conducted using Vitamin Diagnostics, Inc. (CLIA-approved) and Laboratoire Philippe Auguste (ISO-approved). Participants with severe ASDs had significantly increased mercury intoxication-associated urinary porphyrins (pentacarboxyporphyrin, precoproporphyrin, and coproporphyrin) in comparison to participants with mild ASDs, whereas other urinary porphyrins were similar in both groups. Significantly decreased plasma levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), cysteine, and sulfate were observed among study participants relative to controls. In contrast, study participants had significantly increased plasma oxidized glutathione (GSSG) relative to controls. Mercury intoxication-associated urinary porphyrins were significantly correlated with increasing CARS scores and GSSG levels, whereas other urinary porphyrins did not show these relationships. The urinary porphyrin and CARS score correlations observed among study participants suggest that mercury intoxication is significantly associated with autistic symptoms. The transsulfuration abnormalities observed among study participants indicate that mercury intoxication was associated with increased oxidative stress and decreased detoxification capacity.</p>

<p>Folate deficiency is associated with increase in homocysteine levels. Abnormal plasma levels of that neurotoxic nonproteinogenic amino acid is implicated in many pathological conditions including cardiovascular diseases, neural tube defects, and is now recognized as a risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia. Homocysteine elimination is regulated by two metabolic pathways, namely, the transmethylation and the transsulfuration pathways. Its elimination via these two metabolic pathways is modulated by folate, a member of the B-vitamin family. Folate provides, via its metabolic end product 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a methyl group that is used to reconvert homocysteine back to methionine through the transmethylation pathway. The efficiency of folate metabolism has an impact on the availability of S-adenosylmethionine, a compound that is known to activate homocysteine flux through the transsulfuration pathway and is necessary for utilization of a downstream antioxidant called glutathione under the catalysis of glutathione S-transferase enzyme. In this review, we will explore the impact of folate deprivation on the regulation of the methionine cycle and exhaustively describe different biochemical reactions that are implicated in the regulation of homocysteine elimination and that folate deficiency influences in AD neuropathology.</p>

<p>SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine) is the main methyl donor group in the cell. MAT (methionine adenosyltransferase) is the unique enzyme responsible for the synthesis of SAMe from methionine and ATP, and SAMe is the common point between the three principal metabolic pathways: polyamines, transmethylation and transsulfuration that converge into the methionine cycle. SAMe is now also considered a key regulator of metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cell death. Recent results show a new signalling pathway implicated in the proliferation of the hepatocyte, where AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and HuR, modulated by SAMe, take place in HGF (hepatocyte growth factor)-mediated cell growth. Abnormalities in methionine metabolism occur in several animal models of alcoholic liver injury, and it is also altered in patients with liver disease. Both high and low levels of SAMe predispose to liver injury. In this regard, knockout mouse models have been developed for the enzymes responsible for SAMe synthesis and catabolism, MAT1A and GNMT (glycine N-methyltransferase) respectively. These knockout mice develop steatosis and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), and both models closely replicate the pathologies of human disease, which makes them extremely useful to elucidate the mechanism underlying liver disease. These new findings open a wide range of possibilities to discover novel targets for clinical applications.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a sulfur amino acid whose metabolism stands at the intersection of two pathways: remethylation, which requires folic acid and vitamin B12 coenzymes; and transsulfuration, which requires pyridoxal-5’-phosphate, the vitamin B6 coenzyme. Data from a number of laboratories suggest that mild elevations of homocysteine in plasma are a risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. In the Framingham studies, we have shown that plasma homocysteine concentration is inversely related to the intake and plasma levels of folate and vitamin B6 as well as vitamin B12 plasma levels. Almost two-thirds of the prevalence of high homocysteine is attributable to low vitamin status or intake. Elevated homocysteine concentrations in plasma are a risk factor for prevalence of extracranial carotid-artery stenosis &gt; or = 25% in both men and women. Prospectively elevated plasma homocysteine is associated with increased total and cardiovascular mortality, increased incidence of stroke, increased incidence of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, increased incidence of bone fracture, and higher prevalence of chronic heart failure. It was also shown that elevated plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for preeclampsia and maybe neural tube defects (NTD). This multitude of relationships between elevated plasma homocysteine and diseases that afflict the elderly, pregnant women, and the embryo points to the existence ofa common denominator which may be responsible for these diseases. Whether this denominator is homocysteine itself or homocysteine is merely a marker, remains to be determined.</p>

<p>Our recent study (Prathapasinghe GA, Siow YL, O K. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 292: F1354-F1363, 2007) indicates that homocysteine (Hcy) plays a detrimental role in ischemia-reperfusion-induced renal injury. Elevation of renal Hcy concentration during ischemia-reperfusion is attributed to reduced activity of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the transsulfuration pathway for the metabolism of the majority of Hcy in the kidney. However, the mechanisms of impaired CBS activity in the kidney are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pH and nitric oxide (NO) on the CBS activity in the kidney during ischemia-reperfusion. The left kidney of a Sprague-Dawley rat was subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. The CBS activity was significantly reduced in kidneys subjected to ischemia alone (15-60 min) or subjected to ischemia followed by reperfusion for 1-24 h. The pH was markedly reduced in kidneys upon ischemia. Injection of alkaline solution into the kidney partially restored the CBS activity during ischemia. Further analysis revealed that reduction of CBS activity during reperfusion was accompanied by an elevation of NO metabolites (nitrate and nitrite) in the kidney tissue. Injection of a NO scavenger, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO), restored the CBS activity in the kidneys subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Treatment with PTIO could abolish ischemia-reperfusion-induced lipid peroxidation and prevent cell death in the kidney. These results suggested that metabolic acidosis during ischemia and accumulation of NO metabolites during reperfusion contributed, in part, to reduced CBS activity leading to an elevation of renal Hcy levels, which in turn, played a detrimental role in the kidney.</p>

<p>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight of rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most devastating diseases of rice in most rice-growing countries. XometC, a cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) like protein that is an antibacterial drug-target protein against Xoo, was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized. CGL catalyzes the second step in the reverse-transsulfuration pathway, which is essential for the metabolic interconversion of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. Crystals of two different shapes, plate-shaped and pyramid-shaped, diffracted to 2.9 and 3.2 A resolution and belonged to the primitive orthogonal space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and the tetragonal space group P4(1) (or P4(3)), with unit-cell parameters a = 73.0, b = 144.9, c = 152.3 A and a = b = 78.2, c = 300.7 A, respectively.

Transsulfuration metabolites, including: plasma reduced glutathione (GSH), plasma oxidized glutathione (GSSG), plasma cysteine, plasma taurine, plasma sulfate, and plasma free sulfate among participants diagnosed with ASDs (n = 38) in comparison to age-matched neurotypical controls were prospectively evaluated. Testing was conducted using Vitamin Diagnostics, Inc. (CLIA-approved). Participants diagnosed with ASDs had significantly (P &lt; 0.001) decreased plasma reduced GSH, plasma cysteine, plasma taurine, plasma sulfate, and plasma free sulfate relative to controls. By contrast, participants diagnosed with ASDs had significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased plasma GSSG relative to controls. The present observations are compatible with increased oxidative stress and a decreased detoxification capacity, particularly of mercury, in patients diagnosed with ASDs. Patients diagnosed with ASDs should be routinely tested to evaluate transsulfuration metabolites, and potential treatment protocols should be evaluated to potentially correct the transsulfuration abnormalities observed.</p>

<p>Glutathione depletion is a consistent feature of the progression of mild to severe acute pancreatitis. In this study, we examined the temporal relationship between cysteine, homocysteine, and cysteinyl-glycine levels; total reduced erythrocyte glutathione; gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity; and disease severity. Initially, cysteine concentration was low, at levels similar to those of healthy controls. However, glutathione was reduced whilst cysteinyl glycine and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity were increased in both mild and severe attacks. As the disease progressed, glutathione and cysteinyl glycine were further increased in mild attacks and cysteine levels correlated with homocysteine (r = 0.8, P &lt; 0.001) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity (r = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001). The progress of severe attacks was associated with glutathione depletion, reduced gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, and increased cysteinyl glycine that correlated with glutathione depletion (r = 0.99, P = 0.01). These results show that glutathione depletion associated with severe acute pancreatitis occurs despite an adequate cysteine supply and could be attributed to heightened oxidative stress coupled to impaired downstream biosynthesis.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Homocysteine (Hcy) is a risk for vascular occlusion. It is metabolized via remethylation to methionine and transsulfuration to cysteine which has also been related to vascular occlusion. Simultaneous determination of Hcy and cysteine has additional clinical usefulness in providing a presumptive clue to the nature of hyperhomocysteinemia.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A manual HPLC method has been worked out for simultaneous determination of plasma Hcy and cysteine. Concentrations of Hcy were validated with the widely used automated Abbott AxSYM assay. Its usefulness was tested in 87 omnivores and 111 vegans.RESULTS: Excellent correlation between the values of Hcy was found between the manual HPLC method and the automated Abbott assay. The vegans had significantly higher levels of Hcy but lower levels of cysteine than the omnivores (mean +/- SD, micromol/L 23.6 +/- 18.0 vs. 8.8 +/- 2.1 p &lt; 0.001, 225 +/- 30 vs. 245 +/- 34 p &lt; 0.001, respectively). In contrast, the vegans had significantly lower levels of serum vitamin B12 and plasma vitamin B6 than the omnivores (median values 186 vs 565 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001; 37.4 vs. 47.4 nmol/L, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). These findings indicate that the hyperhomocysteinemia in the vegans results from impairment of both remethylation and transsulfuration pathways of Hcy secondary to inadequacy of vitamins B12 and B6 respectively. Thus simultaneous determination of Hcy and cysteine is more useful than determination of only Hcy in that it provides a clue to the nature of hyperhomocysteinemia.CONCLUSION: The manual HPLC method and the Abbott assay gave comparable Hcy values, and thus can be used interchangeably. The HPLC method is economical, useful for hospitals with less demand for determination of Hcy, and capable of simultaneously determining cysteine which has implication in clinical practice.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in brain sulfur-containing amino acid (SCAA) metabolism to determine whether taurine intervened under continuous alcohol intake. We fed 80 male Sprague-Dawley rats 30% alcohol-containing water for 4 weeks. Eighty animals were divided into two groups (with or without 2 g/kg body weight taurine supplementation), and five were killed every week in each group for monitoring SCAA changes in the brain, liver, kidneys and heart. Results indicated that the plasma alcohol concentration increased from Weeks 1-4; however, animals with taurine supplementation showed a lower plasma concentration of ethanol in Week 2. As to SCAA concentrations, cysteine and taurine were both lower after a week of alcohol ingestion in the brain and plasma; the same declining trend was shown in the liver in Week 2. In contrast, plasma and hepatic concentrations of homocysteine were elevated in Week 2, and the plasma S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio also decreased in Week 1. Furthermore, the key cofactor of transsulfuration, pyridoxal-5’-phosphate, significantly declined in the plasma after a week of the ethanol intervention, whereas an increase was observed in brain tissue. Under taurine supplementation, some recoveries were shown by delaying taurine depletion to Week 2, increasing the SAM/SAH ratio and elevating plasma and brain levels of vitamin B6 in Week 2. In conclusion, daily consumption of 30% alcohol interfered with SCAA metabolism, thus decreasing taurine’s role in neurotransmission. The possible mechanism involved might be that ethanol interrupts the production of cysteine, which is the upstream SCAA of taurine, thus decreasing the homocysteine level. Additionally, taurine supplementation delayed this process.</p>

<p>The rates of transmethylation and transsulfuration of methionine were quantified using [1-(13)C]methionine and [C2H3]methionine tracers in newborn infants born at term gestation and in prematurely born low birth weight infants. Whole body rate of protein breakdown was also measured using [2H5]phenylalanine. The response to enteral formula feeding and parenteral nutrition was examined in full term and prematurely born babies, respectively. The relative rates of appearance of methionine and phenylalanine were comparable to the amino acid composition of mixed body proteins. Rates of transmethylation were high, both in full term infants (fast 32 +/- 14 micromol kg(-1) x h(-1); fed 21.7 +/- 3.2) and in preterm infants (57.2 +/- 14.8). Significant flux through the transsulfuration pathway was evident (full term: fast 6.0 +/- 4.4, fed 4.1 +/- 2.1; preterm: 24.9 +/- 9.9 micromol kg(-1) x h(-1)). Transsulfuration of methionine is evident in the human newborn in the immediate neonatal period, suggesting that cysteine may not be considered a “conditionally” essential amino acid for the neonate. The high rate of transmethylation may reflect the high methylation demand, whereas high rates of transsulfuration in premature babies may be related to high demands for glutathione and to the amounts of methionine in parenteral amino acid mixtures.</p>

<p>An integrated metabolic profile reflects the combined influence of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that affect the candidate pathway of interest. Recent evidence suggests that some autistic children may have reduced detoxification capacity and may be under chronic oxidative stress. Based on reports of abnormal methionine and glutathione metabolism in autistic children, it was of interest to examine the same metabolic profile in the parents. The results indicated that parents share similar metabolic deficits in methylation capacity and glutathione-dependent antioxidant/detoxification capacity observed in many autistic children. Studies are underway to determine whether the abnormal profile in parents reflects linked genetic polymorphisms in these pathways or whether it simply reflects the chronic stress of coping with an autistic child.</p>

<p>After protracted low level arsenic exposure, the normal human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 acquires a malignant phenotype with DNA hypomethylation, indicative of disrupted methyl metabolism, and shows arsenic adaptation involving glutathione overproduction and enhanced arsenic efflux. Thus, the interplay between methyl and glutathione metabolism during this progressive arsenic adaptation was studied. Arsenic-treated cells showed a time-dependent increase in LC50 and a marked increase in homocysteine (Hcy) levels. A marked suppression of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels occurred with decreased methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (converts methionine to SAM) expression and increased negative regulator methionine adenosyltransferase B, suggesting reduced conversion of Hcy to SAM. Consistent with Hcy overproduction, activity and expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (converts S-adenosylhomocysteine to Hcy) were both increased. Expression of cystathionine beta-synthase, a key gene in the transsulfuration pathway, and various glutathione production genes were increased, resulting in a 5-fold increase in glutathione. Arsenic efflux increased along with expression of ATP-binding cassette protein C1, which effluxes arsenic as a glutathione conjugate. Evidence of genomic DNA hypomethylation was observed during early arsenic exposure, indicating that the disruption in methyl metabolism had a potential impact related to oncogenesis. Thus, cellular arsenic adaptation is a dynamic, progressive process that involves decreased SAM recycling and concurrent accumulation of Hcy, which is channeled via transsulfuration to increase glutathione and enhance arsenic efflux but may also impact the carcinogenic process.</p>

<p>Human cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CGL) is a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, which functions in the transsulfuration pathway that converts homocysteine to cysteine. In addition, CGL is one of two major enzymes that can catalyze the formation of hydrogen sulfide, an important gaseous signaling molecule. Recently, several mutations in CGL have been described in patients with cystathioninuria, a rare but poorly understood genetic disease. Moreover, a common single nucleotide polymorphism in CGL, c.1364G&gt;T that converts serine at position 403 to isoleucine, has been linked to elevated plasma homocysteine levels. In this study, we have characterized the pathogenic T67I and Q240E missense mutations and the polymorphic variants at amino acid residues 403 using kinetic and spectrophotometric methods. We report that the polymorphism does not influence the cofactor content of the enzyme or its steady-state kinetic properties. In contrast, the T67I mutant exhibits a 3.5-fold decrease in V max compared to that of wild-type CGL, while the Q240E mutant exhibits a 70-fold decrease in V max. The K Ms for cystathionine for both pathogenic mutants are comparable to that of wild type CGL. The PLP content of the T67I and Q240E mutants were about 4-fold and 80-fold lower than that of wild-type enzyme, respectively. Preincubation of the T67I mutant with PLP restored activity to wild-type levels while the same treatment resulted in only partial restoration of activity of the Q240E mutant. These results reveal that both mutations weaken the affinity for PLP and suggest that cystathionuric patients with these mutations should be responsive to pyridoxine therapy.</p>

<p>Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid that is needed for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the major biological methylating agent. Methionine used for AdoMet synthesis can be replenished via remethylation of homocysteine. Alternatively, homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. Aberrations in methionine metabolism are associated with a number of complex diseases, including cancer, anemia, and neurodegenerative diseases. The concentration of methionine in blood and in organs is tightly regulated. Liver plays a key role in buffering blood methionine levels, and an interesting feature of its metabolism is that parallel tracks exist for the synthesis and utilization of AdoMet. To elucidate the molecular mechanism that controls metabolic fluxes in liver methionine metabolism, we have studied the dependencies of AdoMet concentration and methionine consumption rate on methionine concentration in native murine hepatocytes at physiologically relevant concentrations (40-400 microM). We find that both [AdoMet] and methionine consumption rates do not change gradually with an increase in [Met] but rise sharply (approximately 10-fold) in the narrow Met interval from 50 to 100 microM. Analysis of our experimental data using a mathematical model reveals that the sharp increase in [AdoMet] and the methionine consumption rate observed within the trigger zone are associated with metabolic switching from methionine conservation to disposal, regulated allosterically by switching between parallel pathways. This regulatory switch is triggered by [Met] and provides a mechanism for stabilization of methionine levels in blood over wide variations in dietary methionine intake.</p>

<p>Exposure of stationary phase cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to 10 mM HCl (pH approximately 2) resulted in cell death as a function of time (up to 6 h) with most (about 40%-65%) of the cells showing apoptotic features including chromatin condensation along the nuclear envelope, exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of cytoplasmic membrane, and DNA fragmentation. During the first 2 h of acid exposure there was an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level inside cells, with subsequent elevation in the level of lipid peroxidation and decrease in reducing equivalents culminating in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). An initial (1 h) event of mitochondrial hyper-polarization with subsequent elevation of ROS level of the acid treated cells was also observed. S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet; 1 mM) treatment increased the cell survival of the acid stressed cells. It partially scavenged the increased intracellular ROS level by supplementing glutathione through the transsulfuration pathway. It also inhibited acid mediated lipid peroxidation, partially recovered acid evoked loss of DeltaPsi(m) and protected the cells from apoptotic cell death. S-adenosyl di-aldehyde, an indirect inhibitor of the AdoMet metabolic pathway, increased mortality of the acid treated cells. Incubation of acid stressed cells with the antioxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine (1 mM), decreased the cellular mortality, but the same concentration of AdoMet offered more protection by scavenging the free radicals. The ability of AdoMet to scavenge ROS mediated apoptosis may be an important function of this molecule in responding to cellular stress. The study could open a new avenue for detailed investigation on the curative potential of AdoMet against gastric ulcer.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in anti-oxidant defense and detoxification reactions. It is primarily synthesized in the liver by the transsulfuration pathway and exported to provide precursors for in situ GSH synthesis by other tissues. Deficits in glutathione have been implicated in aging and a host of diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, Down syndrome and autism.APPROACH: We explore the properties of glutathione metabolism in the liver by experimenting with a mathematical model of one-carbon metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway, and glutathione synthesis, transport, and breakdown. The model is based on known properties of the enzymes and the regulation of those enzymes by oxidative stress. We explore the half-life of glutathione, the regulation of glutathione synthesis, and its sensitivity to fluctuations in amino acid input. We use the model to simulate the metabolic profiles previously observed in Down syndrome and autism and compare the model results to clinical data.CONCLUSION: We show that the glutathione pools in hepatic cells and in the blood are quite insensitive to fluctuations in amino acid input and offer an explanation based on model predictions. In contrast, we show that hepatic glutathione pools are highly sensitive to the level of oxidative stress. The model shows that overexpression of genes on chromosome 21 and an increase in oxidative stress can explain the metabolic profile of Down syndrome. The model also correctly simulates the metabolic profile of autism when oxidative stress is substantially increased and the adenosine concentration is raised. Finally, we discuss how individual variation arises and its consequences for one-carbon and glutathione metabolism.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine, which represents the committing step in the transsulfuration pathway. CBS is unique in being a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that has a heme cofactor. The activity of CBS under in vitro conditions is responsive to the redox state of the heme, which is distant from the active site and has been postulated to play a regulatory role. The heme in CBS is unusual; it is six-coordinate, low spin, and contains cysteine and histidine as axial ligands. In this study, we have assessed the redox behavior of a human CBS dimeric variant lacking the C-terminal regulatory domain. Potentiometric redox titrations showed a reversible response with a reduction potential of -291 +/- 5 mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode, at pH 7.2. Stopped-flow kinetic determinations demonstrated that Fe(II)CBS reacted with dioxygen yielding Fe(III)CBS without detectable formation of an intermediate species. A linear dependence of the apparent rate constant of Fe(II)CBS decay on dioxygen concentration was observed and yielded a second-order rate constant of (1.11 +/- 0.07) x 10 (5) M (-1) s (-1) at pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C for the direct reaction of Fe(II)CBS with dioxygen. A similar reactivity was observed for full-length CBS. Heme oxidation led to superoxide radical generation, which was detected by the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable oxidation of epinephrine. Our results show that CBS may represent a previously unrecognized source of cytosolic superoxide radical.</p>

<p>Alterations in hepatic transsulfuration reactions were determined in rats treated with a glutathione-depleting agent. A dose of l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine decreased hepatic methionine, cysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, and glutathione levels rapidly. Methionine adenosyltransferase and gamma-glutamylcysteine lygase activities were decreased transiently, but significantly. The activity of cysteine dioxygenase was increased, resulting in an elevation of hypotaurine and taurine concentrations. Administration of phorone reduced hepatic glutathione and cysteine similarly, but S-adenosylmethionine concentrations were elevated for as long as 72h. Hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase, cystathionine beta-synthase, cystathionine gamma-lyase, and gamma-glutamylcysteine lygase activities were all increased but cysteine dioxygenase activity and taurine generation were markedly depressed. The results show that a decrease in hepatic GSH induces profound changes in sulfur amino acid metabolomics, which would subsequently influence various cellular processes. It is suggested that the change in hepatic levels of sulfur-containing substances and its physiological significance should be considered when a glutathione-depleting agent is utilized in biological experiments.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-deficient patients develop premature arteriosclerosis and thrombosis leading to a high risk of a vascular event before the age of 30 years. In CBS deficiency the transsulfuration pathway is impaired, leading to markedly elevated levels of homocysteine and methionine, and severely decreased levels of cystathionine and cysteine. Through autooxidation these elevated levels of homocysteine might induce excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are involved in endothelial damage and are neutralized by antioxidants. In humans the main antioxidant is glutathione (GSH). Its production mainly depends on the amount of available cysteine. Since cysteine levels in CBS deficiency are decreased, GSH production is presumed to be low. Accordingly, all CBS-deficient patients receive cysteine supplements, which supposedly stimulate GSH synthesis. However, data on the effect of cysteine dosage on GSH synthesis in CBS-deficient patients are lacking. Therefore, in a CBS-deficient pyridoxine non-responsive female patient, concentration and fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of erythrocyte GSH were measured by infusion of l-[3,3-(2)H2]cysteine tracer during prolonged cysteine supplementation with 88 and 40 mg/kg per day. Erythrocyte GSH concentration and its FSR at cysteine supplementation with 88 versus 40 mg/kg per day were 1.25 versus 1.30 mmol/L and 230 versus 254% per day, respectively. These data suggest that in a CBS-deficient patient exogenous supply of 40 mg cysteine/kg per day is sufficient to maintain GSH synthesis in erythrocytes. Further studies in larger patient groups should be initiated to measure the effects on GSH metabolism to further elucidate the correct dose of cysteine supplements in CBS-deficient patients.</p>

<p>Gliotoxin (GT) is a secondary fungal metabolite with pleiotropic immunosuppressive properties that have been implicated in Aspergillus virulence. However, the mechanisms of GT cytotoxicity and its molecular targets in eukaryotic cells have not been fully characterized. We screened a haploid library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-gene deletion mutants (4,787 strains in EUROSCARF) to identify nonessential genes associated with GT increased resistance (GT-IR) and increased sensitivity (GT-IS). The susceptibility of the wild-type parental strain BY4741 to GT was initially assessed by broth microdilution methods using different media. GT-IR and GT-IS were defined as a fourfold increase and decrease, respectively, in MIC, and this was additionally confirmed by susceptibility testing on agar yeast extract-peptone-glucose plates. The specificity of GT-IR and GT-IS mutants exhibiting normal growth compared with the wild-type strain was further tested in studies of their susceptibility to conventional antifungal agents, cycloheximide, and H2O2. GT-IR was associated with the disruption of genes acting in general metabolism (OPI1, SNF1, IFA38), mitochondrial function (RTG2), DNA damage repair (RAD18), and vesicular transport (APL2) and genes of unknown function (YGL235W, YOR345C, YLR456W, YGL072C). The disruption of three genes encoding transsulfuration (CYS3), mitochondrial function (MEF2), and an unknown function (YKL037W) led to GT-IS. Specificity for GT-IR and GT-IS was observed in all mutants. Importantly, the majority (69%) of genes implicated in GT-IR (6/10) and GT-IS (2/3) have human homologs. We identified novel Saccharomyces genes specifically implicated in GT-IR or GT-IS. Because most of these genes are evolutionarily conserved, further characterization of their function could improve our understanding of GT cytotoxicity mechanisms in humans.</p>

<p>We report a 24-year-old patient with underlying classical homocystinuria who developed acute neurological deterioration apparently induced by malnutrition secondary to poor compliance with treatment and pancreatitis. Neurological examination revealed stupor, tremor of the upper extremities, spasticity, and Babinski responses of the bilateral lower extremities. The biochemical profile, including marked hypermethioninaemia, hyperhomocysteinaemia, and decreased cystine in plasma, is consistent with cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency. Brain MRI showed reversible diffuse white-matter changes without evidence of thrombosis. The clinical features and neuroimaging including diffusion-weighted MRI suggest a demyelinating process similar to other inborn errors of the transsulfuration pathway such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, disorders affecting methylcobalamin metabolism (cobalamin C, D, E, and G disorders), and methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency. She was left with residual spastic paraparesis despite normal follow-up MRI. Our observation suggests that reversible demyelination is another neurological manifestation of classical homocystinuria; however, the pathophysiology is unknown.</p>

<p>Despite substantial evidence indicating the association of hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcys) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the pathogenic role of increased plasma homocysteine (Hcys) levels in the progression of ESRD remains unclear. This review will briefly summarize recent findings regarding the role of hHcys in the development of glomerulosclerosis, the association of hHcys with reduced renal transsulfuration and Hcys-induced changes of redox signaling in the development of glomerulosclerosis in rat kidneys. Based on these results, it is concluded that hHcys is implicated in glomerular sclerosis in hypertension, elevated plasma Hcys in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) hypertensive rats is due to downregulation of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) expression and consequent abnormality of transsulfuration in the kidney compared with normotensive rats. Hcys-induced superoxide (O(2)(*-)) production by activation of NADPH oxidase as a triggering mechanism contributes to the effects of Hcys on the homeostasis of extracellular matrix and consequent sclerosis in the glomeruli, and NADPH oxidase activation by Hcys is associated with enhanced Rac GTPase activity.</p>

<p>Two alternative pathways for methionine biosynthesis are known in Corynebacterium glutamicum: one involving transsulfuration (mediated by metB and metC) and the other involving direct sulthydrylation (mediated by metY). In this study, MetB (cystathionine gamma-synthase) and MetY (O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase) from C. glutamicum were purified to homogeneity and the biochemical parameters were compared to assess the functional and evolutionary importance of each pathway. The molecular masses of the native MetB and MetY proteins were measured to be approximately 170 and 280 kDa, respectively, showing that MetB was a homotetramer of 40-kDa subunits and MetY was a homohexamer of 45-kDa subunits. The Km values for the O-acetylhomoserine catalysis effected by MetB and MetY were 3.9 and 6.4 mM, and the maximum catalysis rates were 7.4 (kcat = 21 s(-1)) and 6.0 (kcat=28 s(-1)) micromol mg(-1) min(-1), respectively. This suggests that both MetB and MetY can be comparably active in vivo. Nevertheless, the Km value for sulfide ions by MetY was 8.6 mM, which was too high, considering the physiological condition. Moreover, MetB was active at a broad range of temperatures (30 and 65 degrees C) and pH (6.5 and 10.0), as compared with MetY, which was active in a range from 30 to 45 degrees C and at pH values from 7.0 to 8.5. In addition, MetY was inhibited by methionine, but MetB was not. These biochemical data may provide insight on the role of the parallel pathways of methionine biosynthesis in C. glutamicum with regard to cell physiology and evolution.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Glutathione (GSH) is an important intravascular scavenger that protects endothelial cells from atherosclerosis. However, it is still unknown whether cardiovascular (CV) events are associated with metabolic and genetic factors, linked to GSH synthesis in an Italian subpopulation, and if a glutamate-cysteine ligase polymorphism within the catalytic subunit (GCLC) could affect blood and plasma GSH concentrations.METHODS: One hundred subjects, with or without CV risk factors, were enrolled to evaluate plasma and erythrocyte redox status (GSH, homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine), antioxidant vitamins (alpha-tocopherol and ascorbate), malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, and the presence of the GCLC-129 C/T polymorphism; an experimental hyperhomocysteinemia after methionine-induced stimulation of transsulfuration pathway was performed in 91% of enrolled subjects. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic variables were correlated with the presence of CV events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, and stroke).RESULTS: By multiple logistic regression analysis, male sex (P = .027), hypertension (P = .001), and GCLC C/T genotype (P = .009) were the only variables associated with events. Plasma alpha-tocopherol content decreased postmethionine in the T allele subjects compared with wild type (P for time x group interaction = .001). Plasma-reduced GSH level was higher in C/T than in C/C genotype subjects at both time points (P for group = .03), whereas intracellular GSH concentration did not differ between the 2 genotype groups either at baseline or postmethionine.CONCLUSIONS: GCLC T allele, together with hypertension and male sex, is associated with CV events in our study population. Moreover, after stimulation of transsulfuration, intracellular GSH content is preserved in T allele subjects, probably by increases in GSH turnover and export, and consumption of alpha-tocopherol.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Homocysteine lies at an important metabolic branch point; it may be either converted to cystathionine through the transsulfuration pathway, or methylated to form methionine. Hyperhomocysteinemia may result from hereditary defects affecting one of these reactions.STATE OF ART: Cystathionine beta synthase or 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate deficiency can both result in homocystinuria. Current knowledge about biochemical mechanisms leading to hyperhomocysteinemia, clinical and radiological features, pathogenesis and treatment are reviewed, focusing on late onset forms of these diseases which can be diagnosed in adulthood. CBS deficiency is characterized by lens dislocation, skeletal abnormalities, neurologic disturbances and thromboembolism. MTHFR deficiency leads to various neurological symptoms, ranging from developmental delay to encephalopathy, including motor and gait abnormalities, seizures, psychiatric manifestations and rarely strokes. The treatment of CBS deficiency depends on vitamin B6, whereas MTHFR deficiency can be efficiently treated by vitamin B12, folic acid, and betaine.PERSPECTIVES: Homocysteinemia should be measured in patients with unexplained neurological manifestations or thromboembolism.</p>

<p>Impairments in social relatedness and communication, repetitive behaviors, abnormal movement patterns, and sensory dysfunction characterize autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Seventy consecutive patients with an ASD diagnosis (DSM-IV criteria, &gt;/= 6 years-old) who presented to the Genetic Centers of America for outpatient genetic/developmental evaluations from 2005-2007 were examined. Patients were evaluated using CLIA-approved Laboratory Cooperation of America (LabCorp) testing for: serum testosterone, serum free testosterone, % free testosterone, serum/plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstendione, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Morning blood samples collected following an overnight fast, compared to the pertinent reference means, showed significantly increased relative mean levels for: serum testosterone (158%), serum free testosterone (214%), percent free testosterone (121%), DHEA (192%), and androstenedione (173%). By contrast, compared to the pertinent reference mean, the relative mean level of FSH (51%) was significantly decreased. Additionally, at least one of the androgen attributes examined exceeded its recognized laboratory age- and sex-specific reference range in 81.4% (57 of 70) of the patients examined. With respect to their age- and sex-specific reference ranges, females had significantly higher overall mean relative testosterone and relative free testosterone levels than males. Increased androgens in patients diagnosed with ASDs may involve cyclical interactions between the androgen and the transsulfuration pathways, particularly following mercury exposure. A review of therapies that have significantly improved clinical outcomes in ASD patients indicates they share commonality in helping lower androgens. Thus, androgens should be routinely clinically measured in patients with an ASD diagnosis and appropriate androgen-lowering therapies considered for those who have significantly elevated levels.</p>

<p>Cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) catalyses the first step of the transsulfuration pathway that converts l-cysteine to l-homocysteine in bacteria, whereas this pathway is absent in human. In this report, we identified a new metB gene from Helicobacter pylori strain SS1, and the recombinant H. pylori Cystathionine gamma-synthase (HpCGS) was successfully cloned, expressed and purified in Escherichia coli system. Enzymatic study of HpCGS indicated that the K(m) and k(cat)/K(m) values against the substrate O-succinyl-l-homoserine (l-OSHS) were 3.02 mM and 98.7 M(-)(1)s(-)(1), respectively. Moreover, four natural products (alpha-lapachone, 9-hydroxy-alpha-lapachone, Paulownin and Yangambin, Fig. 1) were discovered to demonstrate inhibitory activities against HpCGS with IC(50) values of 11 +/- 3, 9 +/- 1, 19 +/- 2 and 27 +/- 6 microM, respectively. All these four inhibitors prevent the binding of l-OSHS to HpCGS in a non-competitive fashion. In vitro antibacterial assays further indicated that these four discovered compounds could highly inhibit the growth of H. pylori and exhibited strong inhibitory specificity against H. pylori related to E. coli.</p>

<p>In mammalian liver, two intersecting pathways, remethylation and transsulfuration, compete for homocysteine that has been formed from methionine. Remethylation of homocysteine, employing either methyltetrahydrofolate or betaine as the methyl donor, forms a methionine cycle that functions to conserve methionine. In contrast, the transsulfuration sequence – cystathionine synthase and cystathionase – serves to irreversibly catabolize the homocysteine while synthesizing cysteine. The rate of homocysteine formation and its distribution between these two pathways are the sites for metabolic regulation and coordination. The mechanisms for regulation include both the tissue content and the kinetic properties of the component enzymes as well as the concentrations of their substrates and other metabolic effectors. Adenosylmethionine and adenosylhomocysteine are important regulatory metabolites and may use one or more mechanisms to affect the enzymes. Adenosylmethionine is a positive effector of its own synthesis, cystathionine synthase and glycine methyltransferase but impairs both homocysteine methylases. Thus, the concentration of adenosylmethionine may be self-regulatory in mammalian liver. By means of other enzymatic mechanisms, the hepatic concentration of adenosylhomocysteine, an index of homocysteine accumulation, is also self-regulated. These considerations pertain primarily to liver, which has the unique capacity to synthesize more adenosylmethionine in the presence of excess methionine. However, there are organ-specific patterns of methionine metabolism and its regulation. All tissues possess the methionine cycle with methyltetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor but only liver, kidney, pancreas, intestine and brain also contain the transsulfuration pathway. The limitation of adenosylmethionine concentrations may make adenosylhomocysteine a more significant metabolic regulator in extrahepatic tissues. However, estimates of regulatory changes based on determinations of the plasma concentrations of the two metabolites are of limited value and must be used with caution. In addition, the recent description of “cystathionine (CBS) domains” in proteins not involved with methionine metabolism raises the possibility that abnormal concentrations of the adenosyl metabolites may impact on other metabolic pathways.</p>

<p>Clearance of homocysteine via the transsulfuration pathway provides an endogenous route for cysteine synthesis and represents a quantitatively significant source of this amino acid needed for glutathione synthesis. Men have higher plasma levels of total homocysteine than do women, but the mechanism of this sex-dependent difference is not known. In this study, we investigated regulation by testosterone of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which catalyzes the committing step in the transsulfuration pathway. We report that testosterone downregulates CBS expression via a posttranscriptional mechanism in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. This diminution in CBS levels is accompanied by a decrease in flux through the transsulfuration pathway and by a lower intracellular glutathione concentration. The lower antioxidant capacity in testosterone-treated prostate cancer cells increases their susceptibility to oxidative stress conditions. These results demonstrate regulation of the homocysteine-clearing enzyme, CBS, by testosterone and suggest the potential utility of targeting this enzyme as a chemotherapeutic strategy.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a gaseous neuromodulator that can be synthesized by the transsulfuration enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL). In this study we examined H(2)S as a potential neuromodulator in vertebrate retina. CBS-like immunoreactivity (LI) was found in somas in the inner nuclear layer and as punctate staining in the inner and outer plexiform layers in the salamander retina. CGL-LI was most clearly characterized in salamander, where it was localized in Müller cells. Western blots indicated proteins with the correct molecular weights for both enzymes in both species for liver and cerebellum. Correct molecular weight proteins were identified for both CGL and CBS in salamander retina. The CBS antiserum did not recognize the correct molecular weight protein in mouse retina but the CGL antiserum recognized the correct molecular weight protein for mouse retina. Enzyme assays indicated both CGL and CBS enzyme activity in all three tissues in the salamander. There was good CBS activity in the liver and cerebellum of the mouse but no activity in the retina. CGL activity was clearly present only in the mouse liver, with only trace activity in the cerebellum and retina. In conclusion, both CBS and CGL are present in the amphibian retina, which suggests either a potential role for H(2)S as a gaseous neuromodulator in both neurons and glia in the retina or a requirement for cysteine and glutathione synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway as a defense against oxidative stress.</p>

<p>CBS is a vitamin B6-dependent transsulfuration enzyme needed to synthesize cysteine from methionine, catalyzing the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine. A deficiency of CBS causes homocystinuria (MIM 236200), one of the most prevalent inborn errors, characterized by mental retardation, seizures, psychiatric disturbances, skeletal abnormalities and vascular disorders. Patients with CBS deficiency exhibit a major biochemical abnormality, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), a condition associated with highly elevated plasma homocysteine levels. HHcy is recognized as a risk factor for several neurological diseases, such as cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Although the link between CBS deficiency and homocystinuria was first described over 40 years ago and mental retardation was the first clinical feature of the disease to be classified, very little is known about the role of CBS in the CNS. Here we show the regional and cellular distribution of CBS in the adult and developing mouse brain. In the adult mouse brain, CBS was expressed ubiquitously, but most intensely in the cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CBS is preferentially expressed in cerebellar Bergmann glia and in astrocytes throughout the brain. At early developmental stages, CBS was expressed in neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone, but its expression changed to radial glial cells and then to astrocytes during the late embryonic and neonatal periods. Moreover, CBS was significantly accumulated in reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus after kainic acid-induced seizures, and cerebellar morphological abnormalities were observed in CBS-deficient mice. These results support the role of CBS in the development and maintenance of the CNS, and suggest that radial glia/astrocyte dysfunction might be involved in the complex neuropathological features associated with abnormal homocysteine metabolism.</p>

<p>Total plasma homocysteine emerged in the past few years as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This test is now currently prescribed for the diagnosis of unexplained thrombosis in young adults or recurrent thrombosis in patients with arteriopathy. This sulphured amino-acid is an important intermediate in transsulfuration and remethylation pathways of methionine metabolism. Within the context of a collaboration between Monastir and Grenoble Universities and because a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) instrument was available in Monastir, we proposed to transpose a GC-MS method previously developed in Grenoble’s hospital for this parameter and to validate it by comparison with the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method, used at present. Analytical performances were good: detection limit 0.4 micromol/L and linear range up to 4 mg/L (29.6 micromol/L), and between-run and within-run precision with coefficients of variation &lt; 5% and &lt; 8 %, respectively. The comparison with LC-MS-MS method showed a good correlation (y = 0.9874 x -0.208; r(2) = 0.84). Mean difference from LC-MS-MS was -0.4 micromol/L. Plasma concentrations of homocysteine (mean + SD) determined among Tunisian adults, 29 men, 27 women, of the same age were respectively: 11.6 +/- 2.4 micromol/L and 10.1 +/- 2.7 micromol/L, p = 0.025. This method is now currently used to evaluate tHcy concentration in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin B-6 exists in different forms; one of those forms, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), serves a cofactor in many enzyme reactions, including the transsulfuration pathway, in which homocysteine is converted to cystathionine and then to cysteine. Data on the relations between indexes of vitamin B-6 status and transsulfuration metabolites in plasma are sparse and conflicting.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the distribution and associations of various vitamin B-6 species in plasma and their relation to plasma concentrations of transsulfuration metabolites.DESIGN: Nonfasting blood samples from 10 601 healthy subjects with a mean age of 56.4 y were analyzed for all known vitamin B-6 vitamers, folate, cobalamin, riboflavin, total homocysteine, cystathionine, total cysteine, methionine, and creatinine. All subjects were genotyped for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C–&gt;T polymorphism.RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of the main vitamin B-6 vitamers–PLP, pyridoxal, and 4-pyridoxic acid–were strongly correlated. Among the vitamin B-6 vitamers, PLP showed the strongest and most consistent inverse relation to total homocysteine and cystathionine, but the dose response was different for the 2 metabolites. The PLP-total homocysteine relation was significant only in the lowest quartile of the vitamin B-6 distribution and was strongest in subjects with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, whereas cystathionine showed a graded response throughout the range of vitamin B-6 vitamer concentrations, and the effect was not modified by the MTHFR 677C–&gt;T genotype.CONCLUSION: This large population-based study provided precise estimates of the relation between plasma concentrations of vitamin B-6 forms and transsulfuration metabolites as modified by the MTHFR 677C–&gt;T genotype.</p>

<p>CONTEXT: Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, absent in natural diets, is a metabolic intermediary in transmethylation and transsulfuration reactions. Such reactions are essential to normal cellular growth, differentiation, and function. Excess homocysteine is associated with vascular disease and related disorders.OBJECTIVE: To review homocysteine metabolism, the pathogenesis and classification of hyperhomocysteinemia, and the published literature investigating the association of homocysteine and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase defects with arterial and venous thromboembolism and related disorders. The role of vitamin supplementation in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia is addressed.DATA SOURCES: Published medical and scientific literature. Articles addressing the objectives were selected and reviewed. Pertinent studies and conclusions were summarized, grouped, and contrasted.CONCLUSIONS: The association of hyperhomocysteinemia and arterial and venous thrombosis is controversial. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with atherosclerosis. The effect of mild hyperhomocysteinemia is less certain. Coinheritance of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase defects and factor V Leiden is likely to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. The association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase defects combined with no additional thrombophilic risk factors with venous thrombosis is less clear. High doses of folic acid to lower homocysteine levels might not be necessary.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is an independent risk factor for ischemic heart disease and stroke. Epidemiological studies reveal that men have higher tHcy levels than women, but the mechanism underlying this sex-dependent difference is unknown. One route for intracellular disposal of homocysteine is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Renal function is known to be an important determinant of tHcy, and, in this study, we demonstrate that renal CBS expression and activity in mice diminished approximately twofold after castration, whereas ovariectomization was without effect. The higher renal CBS activity in males (22.7 +/- 3.1 mmol cystathionine.h(-1).kg kidney(-1)) vs. females (8.4 +/- 3.4 mmol cystathionine.h(-1).kg kidney(-1), P &lt; or = 10(-6)) in C57Bl/6J mice was associated with lower plasma tHcy levels in males vs. females, and this difference was exacerbated in Cbs+/- mice (7.7 +/- 1.9 micromol/l in males vs. 13.8 +/- 6.4 micromol/l in females, P = 0.005). Surprisingly, mammals exhibit a diversity of regulatory patterns for kidney CBS, with females exhibiting lower CBS activity in mice, higher in rats and humans, and being indistinguishable from males in rabbit, hamster, and guinea pig. Our data suggest that testosterone-dependent regulation of human CBS in kidney may contribute to sex-dependent differences in homocysteine transsulfuration.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of copper deficiency on key aspects of homocysteine metabolism that involve methionine recycling and transsulfuration. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed AIN-93G-based diets containing &lt;1 or approximately 6 mg Cu/kg. After 6 wk (Expt. 1) and 4 wk (Expt. 2) we found that plasma homocysteine was significantly decreased, and plasma glutathione significantly increased, in rats fed the low-Cu diet. Real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of the subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl) in liver that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis. The expression of Gclc, the catalytic subunit of Gcl, was upregulated by Cu deficiency; Gclm, the modifier subunit, was not affected. Hepatic betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (Bhmt), which catalyzes one of the two ways that homocysteine can be remethylated to methionine, was downregulated by Cu deficiency. Because Cu deficiency results in upregulation of Gclc and an increase in the biosynthesis of glutathione, it is plausible that the net flux of homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway is increased. Furthermore, if Bhmt is downregulated, less homocysteine is available for remethylation (methionine recycling) and more is then available to irreversibly enter the transsulfuration pathway where it is lost. The net effect of increased Gclc and decreased Bhmt would be a decrease in homocysteine as a result of Cu deficiency.</p>

<p>In our previous work with rats, plasma and tissue homocysteine concentrations were decreased by selenium deprivation. The purpose of this study was to follow up and expand on that work by determining the effects of selenium status (deficient, adequate, and supranutritional) on several aspects of homocysteine metabolism involving methionine recycling and transsulfuration. A 2nd objective was to determine whether there are differences in how selenium status affects homocysteine metabolism in rats and mice. Male weanling Fischer-344 rats and male weanling CD-1 mice were fed diets containing 0, 0.2, or 2.0 microg selenium (as sodium selenite)/g for 72 d or 60 d, respectively. Plasma homocysteine and cysteine were significantly decreased by feeding rats or mice the selenium-deficient diet compared with feeding adequate or supranutritional selenium. On the other hand, plasma glutathione was increased by selenium deficiency only in rats. Also, the specific activities of liver betaine homocysteine methyltransferase and glycine N-methyltransferase were decreased by selenium deficiency in rats, but were unaffected by selenium status in mice. Real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of the subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis. The expression of Gclc, the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, was upregulated by selenium deprivation in both rat and mouse liver. Gclm, the modifier subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, was downregulated in rats fed 2 microg Se/g compared with rats fed adequate or deficient selenium. Based on these findings, it is evident that selenium deficiency has different outcomes in mice and rats. These variables are all related to methionine/methyl metabolism. Although only one strain of rat was compared with one strain of mouse, this work suggests that differences between species may prove vital in determining which animal model is used in studies of selenium deficiency or in studies that are designed to ascertain chemopreventive mechanisms of selenium.</p>

<p>Folates are carriers of one-carbon units and are metabolized by 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and other enzymes that use riboflavin, cobalamin, or vitamin B6 as cofactors. These B vitamins are essential for the remethylation and transsulfuration of homocysteine, which is an important intermediate in one-carbon metabolism. We studied the MTHFR 677C–&gt;T polymorphism and B vitamins as modulators of one-carbon metabolism in 10,601 adults from the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention (NORCCAP) cohort, using plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) as the main outcome measure. Mean concentrations of plasma tHcy were 10.4 micromol/liter, 10.9 micromol/liter, and 13.3 micromol/liter in subjects with the CC (51%), CT (41%), and TT (8%) genotypes, respectively. The MTHFR 677C–&gt;T polymorphism, folate, riboflavin, cobalamin, and vitamin B6 were independent predictors of tHcy in multivariate models (P&lt;.001), and genotype effects were strongest when B vitamins were low (P&lt;or=.006). Conversely, the MTHFR polymorphism influenced B vitamin effects, which were strongest in the TT group, in which the estimated tHcy difference between subjects with vitamin concentrations in the lowest compared with the highest quartile was 5.4 micromol/liter for folate, 4.1 micromol/liter for riboflavin, 3.2 micromol/liter for cobalamin, and 2.1 micromol/liter for vitamin B6. Furthermore, interactions between B vitamins were observed, and B vitamins were more strongly related to plasma tHcy when concentrations of other B vitamins were low. The study provides comprehensive data on the MTHFR-B vitamin network, which has major effects on the transfer of one-carbon units. Individuals with the TT genotype were particularly sensitive to the status of several B vitamins and might be candidates for personalized nutritional recommendations.</p>

<p>Methionine is an indispensable sulfur amino acid that functions as a key precursor for the synthesis of homocysteine and cysteine. Studies in adult humans suggest that splanchnic tissues convert dietary methionine to homocysteine and cysteine by means of transmethylation and transsulfuration, respectively. Studies in piglets show that significant metabolism of dietary indispensable amino acids occurs in the gastrointestinal tissues (GIT), yet the metabolic fate of methionine in GIT is unknown. We show here that 20% of the dietary methionine intake is metabolized by the GIT in piglets implanted with portal and arterial catheters and fed milk formula. Based on analyses from intraduodenal and intravenous infusions of [1-(13)C]methionine and [(2)H(3)]methionine, we found that the whole-body methionine transmethylation and remethylation rates were significantly higher during duodenal than intravenous tracer infusion. First-pass splanchnic metabolism accounted for 18% and 43% of the whole-body transmethylation and remethylation, respectively. Significant transmethylation and transsulfuration was demonstrated in the GIT, representing approximately 27% and approximately 23% of whole-body fluxes, respectively. The methionine used by the GIT was metabolized into homocysteine (31%), CO(2) (40%), or tissue protein (29%). Cystathionine beta-synthase mRNA and activity was present in multiple GITs, including intestinal epithelial cells, but was significantly lower than liver. We conclude that the GIT consumes 20% of the dietary methionine and is a significant site of net homocysteine production. Moreover, the GITs represent a significant site of whole-body transmethylation and transsulfuration, and these two pathways account for a majority of methionine used by the GITs.</p>

<p>Hepatic folate, methyl group, and homocysteine metabolism are interrelated pathways that when disrupted are associated with numerous pathologies. Maintenance of normal methyl group and homocysteine homeostasis is dependent on the balance between: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent transmethylation, which utilizes methyl groups and produces homocysteine; remethylation of homocysteine back to methionine by folate-dependent and -independent mechanisms; and homocysteine catabolism via the transsulfuration pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that hormonal imbalance is a factor in the control of key proteins that regulate these pathways. A diabetic state is characterized by increased expression of specific methyltransferases that utilize SAM-derived methyl groups and produce homocysteine. Although the supply of methyl groups from the folate-dependent 1-carbon pool appears to be diminished under diabetic conditions, the increased production of homocysteine is compensated for by stimulation of folate-independent remethylation and catabolism by transsulfuration, resulting in hypohomocysteinemia. Similar changes have been observed with glucocorticoid administration and in a growth hormone-deficient model, which can be prevented by insulin and growth hormone treatment, respectively. Taken together, these reports clearly indicate that hormonal regulation is a major factor in the metabolic control of folate, methyl groups, and homocysteine, thereby providing a potential link between the pathologies associated with these pathways and hormonal imbalance.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: A medical hypothesis has suggested that some autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may result from interactions between the methionine cycle-transsulfuration and androgen pathways following exposure to mercury.METHODS: The IRB of the Institute for Chronic Illnesses approved the present study. A novel treatment was utilized combining LUPRON (leuprolide acetate, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and CHEMET (meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid–DMSA, McNeil Consumer Products Company) on 11 consecutive children with ASDs.RESULTS: A significant (p&lt;0.01) overall improvement from the 70-79th percentile of severity (median baseline score=87) at baseline to the 40-49th percentile of severity (median end of study period score=63) at the end of the study was observed for patients treated for a median of approximately 4 months. Significant improvements in sociability, cognitive awareness, behavior, and clinical symptoms/behaviors of hyperandrogenemia were also observed. Significant decreases in blood androgens and increases in urinary heavy metal concentrations were observed. Minimal drug adverse effects were found.CONCLUSION: This study provides the first clinical evidence for the benefit that combined anti-androgen and anti-heavy metal therapy may have on some children with ASDs. Additional studies should examine androgen and heavy metal mechanisms of action in ASDs, and future ASD treatment protocols should consider androgens and heavy metals.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Children with edematous but not nonedematous severe childhood undernutrition (SCU) have lower plasma and erythrocyte-free concentrations of cysteine and methionine, which suggests a decreased availability of methionine for cysteine synthesis. We propose that methionine production and metabolism will be slower in children with edematous SCU than in those with nonedematous SCU.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure methionine flux, its transmethylation and its transsulfuration, and homocysteine remethylation in children with SCU.DESIGN: Methionine kinetics were measured in 2 groups of children with edematous (n = 11) and nonedematous (n = 11) SCU when they were infected and malnourished (clinical phase 1), when they were still severely malnourished but no longer infected (clinical phase 2), and when they had recovered (clinical phase 3).RESULTS: At clinical phase 1, children with edematous SCU had rates of total methionine flux, flux from protein breakdown, and flux to protein synthesis that were slower than the rates of the nonedematous group. There were no significant differences in homocysteine remethylation or methionine transsulfuration and transmethylation between the groups at clinical phase 1.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that, in the acutely malnourished and infected state, children with edematous SCU have slower methionine production than do children with nonedematous SCU because of a slower rate of release from protein breakdown. This slower methionine production is not, however, associated with slower rates of methionine transsulfuration and transmethylation or homocysteine remethylation.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the recent evidence indicating that sulfur amino acid metabolism in gastrointestinal tissues may be linked to human health and gut disease.RECENT FINDINGS: Studies indicate that the gastrointestinal tract metabolizes 20% of dietary methionine and that its main metabolic fate is transmethylation to homocysteine and transsulfuration to cysteine. The gastrointestinal tract accounts for approximately 25% of whole-body transmethylation and transsulfuration and is a site of net homocysteine release. The production of homocysteine within the intestinal mucosa may contribute to the inflammatory response and endothelial cell dysfunction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Studies also show that the availability of S-adenosylmethionine as a precursor for methylation reactions and polyamines plays a key role in epigenetic DNA methylation, gene expression and colon carcinogenesis. Cysteine derived from the diet and methionine transsulfuration is a functional constituent of antioxidant systems and impacts several elements of redox status that regulate epithelial intracellular signaling, proliferation and survival.SUMMARY: Further studies are warranted to establish how local production of homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine and antioxidants contributes to the development of gastrointestinal diseases and whether dietary intervention with folate and cysteine is an efficacious approach to prevention and treatment.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first irreversible step in the transsulfuration pathway and commits the toxic metabolite, homocysteine, to the synthesis of cysteine. Mutations in CBS are the most common cause of severe hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia. The molecular basis of the organ-specific pathologies associated with CBS deficiency is unknown as is the significance of the reported interaction between CBS and Huntingtin protein. In this study, we have used the yeast two-hybrid approach to screen for proteins that interact with CBS and have identified several components of the sumoylation pathway including Ubc9, PIAS1, PIAS3, Pc2, and RanBPM. We demonstrate that CBS is modified by the small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 protein (SUMO-I) under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Deletion analysis of CBS indicates that the C-terminal regulatory domain is required for interaction with proteins in the sumoylation machinery. Sumoylated CBS is present in the nucleus where it is associated with the nuclear scaffold. The discovery that CBS is a target of sumoylation adds another layer to the complex regulation of this enzyme and reveals a previously unknown residence for this protein, i.e., in the nucleus.</p>

<p>Modulation of the ambient redox status by mononuclear phagocytes is central to their role in health and disease. However, little is known about the mechanism of redox regulation during mononuclear phagocyte differentiation and activation, critical cellular steps in innate immunity, and microbial clearance. An important intermediate in GSH-based redox metabolism is homocysteine, which can undergo transmethylation via methionine synthase (MS) or transsulfuration via cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). The transsulfuration pathway generates cysteine, the limiting reagent in GSH biosynthesis. We now demonstrate that expression of CBS and MS are strongly induced during differentiation of human monocytes and are regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, respectively. The changes in enzyme expression are paralleled by an approximately 150% increase in S-adenosylmethionine (accompanied by a corresponding increase in phospholipid methylation) and a similar increase in GSH. Activation with lipopolysachharide or infection with Mycobacterium smegmatis diminished expression of both enzymes to a significant extent and decreased S-adenosylmethionine concentration by approximately 30% of the control value while GSH and cysteine concentrations increased approximately 100 and 300%, respectively. Blockade of the transsulfuration pathway with propargylglycine suppressed clearance of M. smegmatis by macrophages and inhibited phagolysosomal fusion, whereas N-acetylcysteine promoted phagolysosomal fusion and enhanced mycobacterial clearance 3-fold compared with untreated cells. We posit that regulation of the transsulfuration pathway during monocyte differentiation, activation, and infection can boost host defense against invading pathogens and may represent a heretofore unrecognized antimicrobial therapeutic target.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress and diminished glutathione pools play critical roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Synthesis of glutathione, the most abundant mammalian antioxidant, is regulated at the substrate level by cysteine, which is synthesized from homocysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. Elevated homocysteine and diminished glutathione levels, seen in Alzheimer and Parkinson disease patients suggest impairments in the transsulfuration pathway that connects these metabolites. However, the very existence of this metabolic pathway in the brain is a subject of controversy. The product of the first of two enzymes in this pathway, cystathionine, is present at higher levels in brain as compared with other organs. This, together with the reported absence of the second enzyme, gamma-cystathionase, has led to the suggestion that the transsulfuration pathway is incomplete in the brain. In this study, we incubated mouse and human neurons and astrocytes and murine brain slices in medium with [35S]methionine and detected radiolabel incorporation into glutathione. This label transfer was sensitive to inhibition of gamma-cystathionase. In adult brain slices, approximately 40% of the glutathione was depleted within 10 h following gamma-cystathionase inhibition. In cultured human astrocytes, flux through the transsulfuration pathway increased under oxidative stress conditions, and blockade of this pathway led to reduced cell viability under oxidizing conditions. This study establishes the presence of an intact transsulfuration pathway and demonstrates its contribution to glutathione-dependent redox-buffering capacity under ex vivo conditions in brain cells and slices.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing, nonproteinogenic, neurotoxic amino acid biosynthesized during methyl cycles after demethylation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and subsequent hydrolysis of SAH into homocysteine and adenosine. Formed homocysteine is either catabolized into cystathionine (transsulfuration pathway) by cystathionine beta-synthase, or remethylated into methionine (remethylation pathway) by methionine synthase. To demonstrate the specificity of Ras-elicited effects on the activity of methyl cycles, wild-type pheochromocytoma PC12, mutant oncogenic rasH gene (MVR) expressing PC12 pheochromocytoma and normal c-rasH stably transfected M-CR3B cells were incubated with the N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and manumycin, (inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and farnesyltransferase, respectively). We have found that L-NAME significantly changes the SAM/SAH ratio in both MCR and MVR cells. Moreover, these alterations have reciprocal character; in the MCR cells, the SAM/SAH ratio was raised, whereas in the MVR cells this ratio was decreased. We conclude that depletion of endogenous NO with L-NAME increased the production of SAH only in cells with mutated oncogenic RasH, possibly through enhancement of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress can increase cystathionine beta-synthase activity that switches methyl cycles from remethylation into transsulfuration pathway to maintain the intracellular glutathione pool (essential for the redox-regulating capacity of cells) via an adaptive process.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a tetrameric heme protein that catalyzes the PLP-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine. CBS occupies a crucial regulatory position between the methionine cycle and transsulfuration. Human CBS contains 11 cysteine residues that are highly conserved in mammals but completely absent in the yeast enzyme, which catalyzes an identical reaction, suggesting a possible regulatory role for some of these residues. In this report, we demonstrate that in both the presence and absence of the CBS allosteric regulator S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), only C15 and C431 of human CBS are solvent accessible. Mutagenesis of C15 to serine did not affect catalysis or AdoMet activation but significantly reduced aggregation of the purified enzyme in vitro. Mutagenesis of C431 resulted in a constitutively activated form of CBS that could not be further activated by either AdoMet or thermal activation. We and others have previously reported a number of C-terminal CBS point mutations that result in a decreased or abolished response to AdoMet. In contrast to all of these previously investigated CBS mutants, the C431 mutant form of CBS was unable to bind AdoMet, indicating that either this residue is directly involved in AdoMet binding or its absence induces a conformational change that destroys the integrity of the binding site for this regulatory ligand.</p>

<p>Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) is the last key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway for the biosynthesis of cysteine from methionine in mammals, and catalyzes the hydrolysis of cystathionine into cysteine. Cysteine can be provided through diet; however, several investigators have suggested that infants may require dietary supplements of cysteine because of very low or undetectable CSE activity in their livers. We have previously shown that CSE levels are much lower in the livers and kidneys of fetal and infant mice than in those of adult mice, suggesting that the maternal supply of cysteine is important for the early development of mice. Here we examined changes of CSE expression in the livers and kidneys of dams during gestation and lactation. Hepatic enlargement was observed as early as gestational day 12.5 (G12.5) and thereafter became more prominent, whereas expression of CSE in the livers was found after postpartum day 1 (P1) and reached a peak at P14. The maintenance of lactation was essential for both hepatic enlargement and CSE expression. In contrast, kidneys gained weight only slightly during lactation while CSE expression in kidneys was markedly induced at G15.5 and then gradually declined through to P28. Serum concentrations of homocysteine (the precursor of cystathionine) were significantly lower in G18.5 dams than in virgins or G15.5 dams, suggesting that the expression of CSE in the kidneys contributes to the effective clearance of homocysteine during the late gestational stage.</p>

<p>Autism is a behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental disorder usually diagnosed in early childhood that is characterized by impairment in reciprocal communication and speech, repetitive behaviors, and social withdrawal. Although both genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved, none have been reproducibly identified. The metabolic phenotype of an individual reflects the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors on genotype. As such, it provides a window through which the interactive impact of genes and environment may be viewed and relevant susceptibility factors identified. Although abnormal methionine metabolism has been associated with other neurologic disorders, these pathways and related polymorphisms have not been evaluated in autistic children. Plasma levels of metabolites in methionine transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways were measured in 80 autistic and 73 control children. In addition, common polymorphic variants known to modulate these metabolic pathways were evaluated in 360 autistic children and 205 controls. The metabolic results indicated that plasma methionine and the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), an indicator of methylation capacity, were significantly decreased in the autistic children relative to age-matched controls. In addition, plasma levels of cysteine, glutathione, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione, an indication of antioxidant capacity and redox homeostasis, were significantly decreased. Differences in allele frequency and/or significant gene-gene interactions were found for relevant genes encoding the reduced folate carrier (RFC 80G &gt; A), transcobalamin II (TCN2 776G &gt; C), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT 472G &gt; A), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C &gt; T and 1298A &gt; C), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST M1). We propose that an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress (endogenous or environmental) may contribute to the development and clinical manifestations of autism.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a neurotoxic non-proteinogenic amino acid, an abnormal increase of which in plasma has been implicated in many pathological conditions including cardiovascular diseases, neural tube defects and is now recognized and Alzheimer’s disease. Homocysteine elimination is regulated by the transmethylation and the transsulfuration pathways and is modulated by folate, a member of the B-vitamin family. A metabolic product of folate, 5 methyltetrahydrofolate, provides a methyl group that is used to reconvert homocysteine back to methionine through the transmethylation pathway. The efficiency of folate metabolism has an impact on the availability of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a compound that is known to activate homocysteine flux through the transsulfuration pathway. SAM is also necessary for utilization of the antioxidant glutathione via glutathione S-transferase. In this review, I will elaborate on different biochemical reactions that are implicated in the regulation of homocysteine elimination through the transmethylation and the transsulfuration pathways and on various consequences of folate deficiency on homocysteine metabolism.</p>

<p>The transsulfuration pathway, which aids in regulating homocysteine concentration and mediates cysteine synthesis, may be sensitive to vitamin B-6 status because cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) require pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). To assess relations between vitamin B-6 and transsulfuration, we evaluated the effects of dietary pyridoxine (PN) on the hepatic concentration of relevant metabolites and in vitro activity of CBS and CGL. Growing rats were fed AIN-93G- or AIN-76A-based diets that ranged from adequate to deficient in vitamin B-6 (2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, or 0 mg of PN/kg diet, n = 5). This design allowed assessment of the effects of supplemental methionine (AIN-76A) vs. cysteine (AIN-93G) in common research diets over a range of vitamin B-6 levels. CBS activity, assayed in the presence or absence of added S-adenosylmethionine, was independent of diet type and PN level. CGL activity was independent of diet type but proportional to dietary PN. Rats fed deficient (0 and 0.1 mg PN/kg) diets exhibited only approximately 30% of the CGL activity of those fed the 2 mg PN/kg diets. Hepatic cystathionine increased from 20 to 30 nmol/g for the 1-2 mg PN/kg diets to approximately 85 nmol/g for the 0 mg PN/kg diet; however, cysteine was reduced only in B-6-deficient rats consuming the AIN-93G diet (means of 30-40 nmol/g for adequate to 11.6 nmol/g for 0 mg PN/kg AIN-76A diet). In spite of these effects, hepatic glutathione concentration increased in vitamin B-6 deficiency. These results suggest that vitamin B-6-dependent changes in transsulfuration do not limit hepatic glutathione production.</p>

<p>AIMS: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is 1 in 300 children in the US. ASDs are characterized by impairments in social relatedness and communication, repetitive behaviors, abnormal movement patterns, and sensory dysfunction. Pre-pubertal age children with ASDs were assessed for metabolites in the methionine cycle-transsulfuration and androgen pathways, and for present physical development/behaviors indicative of hyperandrogenicity.METHODS: The Institutional Review Board of the Institute for Chronic Illnesses (Office for Human Research Protections, US Department of Health and Human Services IRB number: IRB00005375) approved the present study. Sixteen consecutive pre-pubertal age children (&lt;/=11 years old; mean +/- SD: 5.9 +/- 2.1 years old) with previously diagnosed ASDs that presented to the Genetic Centers of America for outpatient care were evaluated.RESULTS: Significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased levels of serum/plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and serum total testosterone relative to the age- and sex-specific normal laboratory reference ranges were observed. Conversely, serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased. Plasma-reduced glutathione (p &lt; 0.01), plasma cysteine (p &lt; 0.01), plasma methionine (p &lt; 0.01), serum cystathionine (p &lt; 0.05), and serum homocysteine (p &lt; 0.01) were all significantly decreased.CONCLUSION: The results suggest a possible cyclical interaction between the methionine cycle-transsulfuration and androgen pathways in some children with ASDs.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Patients with intestinal failure who require long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) develop catheter thrombosis as a complication. This patient group may also develop choline deficiency because of a defect in the hepatic transsulfuration pathway in the setting of malabsorption. This study was undertaken to determine whether choline deficiency is a risk factor for development of catheter thrombosis.METHODS: Plasma free and phospholipid-bound choline concentrations were measured in a group of 41 patients that required long-term PN. Episodes of catheter thrombosis from onset of PN to the time of blood testing were recorded.RESULTS: Sixteen (39%) patients developed catheter thrombosis, and 5 of these had recurrent catheter thrombosis. Plasma free choline was 7.7 +/- 2.7 nmol/mL in patients with no history of catheter thrombosis and 6.2 +/- 1.7 nmol/mL in patients with previous catheter thrombosis (p = .076 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The partial correlation between plasma free choline concentration and the frequency of clots after controlling for catheter duration was r = -0.33 (p = .038). The relative risk for catheter thrombosis in subjects with a plasma free choline concentration &lt;8 nmol/mL was 10.0, 95% confidence interval (1.134-88.167). Plasma phospholipid-bound choline concentration was 2191.7 +/- 679.0 nmol/mL in patients with previous catheter thrombosis and 2103.3 +/- 531.2 nmol/mL in patients without history of catheter thrombosis (p = NS).CONCLUSION: Choline deficiency is a significant risk factor for development of catheter thrombosis in patients with intestinal failure who require PN.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Alcoholic liver disease is associated with abnormalities of methionine metabolic enzymes that may contribute to glutathione depletion. Previously, we found that feeding micropigs a combination of ethanol with a folate-deficient diet resulted in the greatest decreases in S-adenosylmethionine and glutathione and increases in liver S-adenosylhomocysteine and oxidized disulfide glutathione.METHODS: To study the mechanisms of glutathione depletion, we analyzed the transcripts and activities of enzymes involved in its synthesis and metabolism in liver and plasma specimens that were available from the same micropigs that receive folate-sufficient or folate-depleted diets with or without 40% of energy as ethanol for 14 weeks.RESULTS: Ethanol feeding, folate deficiency, or their combination decreased liver and plasma glutathione and the activities of hepatic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and increased the activity of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase. Hepatic levels of cysteine and taurine were unchanged while plasma cysteine was increased in the combined diet group. Cystathionine beta-synthase transcripts and activity were unaffected by ethanol feeding, while the activities of other transsulfuration enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis were increased. Glutathione transferase transcripts were increased 4-fold and its mean activity was increased by 34% in the combined ethanol and folate-deficient diet group, similar in magnitude to the observed 36% reduction in hepatic glutathione.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ethanol feeding and folate deficiency acted individually or synergistically to affect methionine metabolism in the micropig by depleting glutathione pools and altering transcript expressions and activities of enzymes involved in its synthesis, utilization, and regeneration. The data suggest that the observed decrease in hepatic glutathione during ethanol feeding reflects its increased utilization to meet increased antioxidant demands, rather than reduction in its synthesis.</p>

<p>Rhodanese or thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that plays roles in cyanide detoxification, the formation of iron-sulfur proteins and the modification of sulfur-containing enzymes. Transsulfuration reaction catalyzed by TST is also involved in H(2)S detoxification. To date, no polymorphism of the human TST gene had been reported. We developed a screening strategy based on a PCR-SSCP method to search for mutations in the 3 exons of TST and their proximal flanking regions. This strategy has been applied to DNA samples from 50 unrelated French individuals of Caucasian origin. Eleven polymorphisms consisting in seven nucleotide substitutions in non-coding regions, two silent mutations and two missense mutations were characterized. The functional consequences of the identified mutations were assessed in vivo by measurement of erythrocyte TST activity and/or in vitro using heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or transient transfection assay in HT29 and Caco-2 cell lines. The P(285)A variant appears to encode a protein with a 50% decrease of in vitro intrinsic clearance compared to the wild-type enzyme. Additionally, the six polymorphisms located upstream the ATG initiation codon are responsible for a significant decrease (ranging from 40% to 73%) in promoter activity of a reporter gene compared to the corresponding wild-type sequence. This work constitutes the first report of the existence of a functional genetic polymorphism affecting TST activity and should be of great help to investigate certain disorders for which impairment of CN(-) or H(2)S detoxification have been suggested to be involved.</p>

<p>CONTEXT: Abnormal homocysteine metabolism may contribute to increased cardiovascular death in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Amino acid metabolism is altered in T1DM. In vitro, insulin reduces hepatic catabolism of homocysteine by inhibiting liver transsulfuration. It remains to be determined whether methionine-homocysteine metabolism is altered in T1DM.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether insulin deficiency during insulin deprivation or high plasma insulin concentration after insulin treatment alters homocysteine metabolism in T1DM.DESIGN: This was an acute interventional study with paired and comparative controls.SETTING: The study was conducted at a general clinical research center.PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: We used stable isotope tracers to measure methionine-homocysteine kinetics in six patients with T1DM during insulin deprivation (I-) and also during insulin treatment (I+) and compared them with nondiabetic controls (n = 6).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Homocysteine kinetics (transmethylation, transsulfuration, and remethylation) were from plasma isotopic enrichment of methionine and homocysteine and (13)CO(2).RESULTS: T1DM (I-) had lower rates of homocysteine-methionine remethylation (P &lt; 0.05 vs. control and I+). In contrast, transsulfuration rates were higher in I- than controls and I+ (P &lt; 0.05). Insulin treatment normalized transsulfuration and remethylation (P &lt; 0.05 vs. I- and P &gt; 0.8 vs. control). Plasma homocysteine concentrations were lower in T1DM (P &lt; 0.05 vs. control during both I- and I+), which may be explained by increased homocysteine transsulfuration. Thus, significant alterations of methionine-homocysteine metabolism occur during insulin deprivation in humans with T1DM.CONCLUSIONS: Insulin plays a key role in the regulation of methionine-homocysteine metabolism in humans, and altered homocysteine may occur during insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetic patients.</p>

<p>The conversion of cysteine to 3-sulfino-alanine is a major pathway in cysteine catabolism. Cysteine dioxygenase catalyzes the reaction and dietary intake of the essential amino acid methionine and the semi-essential amino acid cysteine increases the level of this enzyme by suppressing enzyme degradation via polyubiquitination. The production of cellular antioxidants such as glutathione, thioredoxin, and their families is important in cysteine metabolism, and these cellular antioxidants have critical roles in the maintenance of the cellular redox status. The mercaptopyruvate pathway, in which cysteine or aspartate transaminase catalyzes the transamination from cysteine to 3-mercaptopyruvate and then 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase catalyzes the transsulfuration from 3-mercaptopyruvate to pyruvate, also contributes to maintain the cellular redox. 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase serves as an antioxidant protein: when the enzyme is exposed to stoichiometric amounts of the oxidant hydrogen peroxide, it is inhibited via the formation of low redox sulfenate at the catalytic site cysteine. On the other hand, activity is restored by the reductant dithiothreitol or reduced thioredoxin. 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase also detoxifies cyanide via transsulfuration from a stable persulfide at the catalytic site cysteine, a reaction intermediate, suggesting that cyanide detoxification is not necessarily an enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, a congenital defect of the enzyme causes mercaptolactate-cysteine disulfiduria associated with or without mental retardation, although the pathogenesis remains unclear. These facts suggest that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase has physiologic roles as an antioxidant and a cyanide antidote; is essential for neural function, and participates in cysteine degradation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Rodents are often used as animal models to dissect mechanisms underlying hyperhomocysteinemia atherogenicity in humans. However, neither wild-type rodents nor cystathionine beta-synthase deficient mice develop spontaneous atherosclerosis. We investigated whether species-specific differences in thiols metabolism may explain the respective sensitivity of rodents and humans to hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODS: Thiols and vitamins B levels were determined in normohomocysteinemic humans and rodents, and in hyperhomocysteinemic mice.RESULTS: In basal status, although plasma homocysteine, cysteine and cysteinylglycine levels were lower, glutathione levels were higher in mice than in humans (4.0+/-1.6 vs. 7.9+/-2.2, P&lt;0.0005; 147.4+/-40.3 vs. 278.5+/-50.0, P&lt;0.0001; 2.3+/-0.7 vs. 36.6+/-7.3, P&lt;0.0001; and 70.9+/-20.1 vs. 4.6+/-1.6, P&lt;0.0001). Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels were 2.5- and 7.7-fold higher in rats than in humans. In wild-type mice, the increase in plasma Hcy levels induced by methionine-enriched diet was accompanied by a proportional increase in GSH levels.CONCLUSION: GSH levels are enough to modulate Hcy effects in normo- and hyperhomocysteinemic mice but not in humans. This rodents characteristic, likely supported by species differences in the relative contribution of remethylation and transsulfuration pathways, may partly explain their protection against atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Two superimposed metabolic sequences, transsulfuration and the methionine/homocysteine cycle, form the pathway for methionine metabolism in mammalian liver. This combined pathway was formulated first to explain observations in subjects with homocystinuria caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency. Since that time additional inborn errors have been discovered, and currently we know of human subjects with isolated defects in all of the reactions of the combined pathway with only one exception: betaine homocysteine methyltransferase. Studies of these inborn errors have contributed significantly to our knowledge of human methionine metabolism and to the clinical consequences of impaired metabolism. Transsulfuration appears to function primarily for the metabolism of excess methionine, and each of the 5 defects in this pathway results in the accumulation of 1 or more of the normal metabolites. Thus, studies of these disorders may provide insight into both the potential pathological sequelae of nutritional methionine excess as well as whether laboratory testing allows the detection of excess.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a sulfur amino acid whose metabolism stands at the intersection of 2 pathways: remethylation, which requires folic acid and B-12 coenzymes, and transsulfuration, which requires pyridoxal-5’-phosphate, the B-6 coenzyme. Data from several studies suggest that mild elevations of homocysteine in plasma are a risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. In the Framingham studies we have shown that plasma total homocysteine concentration is inversely related to the intake and plasma levels of folate and vitamin B-6 as well as vitamin B-12 plasma levels. Almost two-thirds of the prevalence of high homocysteine is attributable to low vitamin status or intake. Elevated homocysteine concentrations in plasma are a risk factor for prevalence of extracranial carotid artery stenosis of at least 25% in both men and women. Prospectively elevated plasma homocysteine is associated with increased total and CVD mortality, increased incidence of stroke, increased incidence of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, increased incidence of bone fracture, and higher prevalence of chronic heart failure. This multitude of relationships between elevated plasma total homocysteine and diseases that afflict the elderly point to the existence of a common denominator that may be responsible for these diseases. Whether this denominator is homocysteine itself or whether homocysteine is merely a marker remains to be determined.</p>

<p>Nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) coexist in the biosphere as free elements or in the form of simple inorganic NO3- and SO4(2-) oxyanions, which must be reduced before undergoing anabolic processes leading to the production of methionine (Met) and other S-containing molecules. Both N and S pathways are tightly regulated in plant tissues so as to maintain S:N ratios ranging from 1:20 to 1:35. As a result, plant products do not adequately fulfill human tissue requirements, whose mean S:N ratios amount to 1:14.5. The evolutionary patterns of total body N (TBN) and of total body S (TBS) offer from birth to death sex- and age-related specificities well identified by the serial measurement of plasma transthyretin (TTR). Met is regarded as the most limiting of all indispensable amino acids (IAAs) because of its participation in a myriad of molecular, structural, and metabolic activities of survival importance. Met homeostasis is regulated by subtle competitive interactions between transsulfuration and remethylation pathways of homocysteine (Hcy) and by the actual level of TBN reserves working as a direct sensor of cystathionine-beta-synthase activity. Under steady-state conditions, the dietary intake of SO4(2-) is essentially equal to total sulfaturia. The recommended dietary allowances for both S-containing AAs allotted to replace the minimal obligatory losses resulting from endogenous catabolism is largely covered by Western customary diets. By contrast, strict vegans and low-income populations living in plant-eating countries incur the risk of chronic N and Met dietary deficiencies causing undesirable hyperhomocysteinemia best explained by the downsizing of their TBN resources and documented by declining TTR plasma values.</p>

<p>Methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and taurine are the 4 common sulfur-containing amino acids, but only the first 2 are incorporated into proteins. Sulfur belongs to the same group in the periodic table as oxygen but is much less electronegative. This difference accounts for some of the distinctive properties of the sulfur-containing amino acids. Methionine is the initiating amino acid in the synthesis of virtually all eukaryotic proteins; N-formylmethionine serves the same function in prokaryotes. Within proteins, many of the methionine residues are buried in the hydrophobic core, but some, which are exposed, are susceptible to oxidative damage. Cysteine, by virtue of its ability to form disulfide bonds, plays a crucial role in protein structure and in protein-folding pathways. Methionine metabolism begins with its activation to S-adenosylmethionine. This is a cofactor of extraordinary versatility, playing roles in methyl group transfer, 5’-deoxyadenosyl group transfer, polyamine synthesis, ethylene synthesis in plants, and many others. In animals, the great bulk of S-adenosylmethionine is used in methylation reactions. S-Adenosylhomocysteine, which is a product of these methyltransferases, gives rise to homocysteine. Homocysteine may be remethylated to methionine or converted to cysteine by the transsulfuration pathway. Methionine may also be metabolized by a transamination pathway. This pathway, which is significant only at high methionine concentrations, produces a number of toxic endproducts. Cysteine may be converted to such important products as glutathione and taurine. Taurine is present in many tissues at higher concentrations than any of the other amino acids. It is an essential nutrient for cats.</p>

<p>In the article, the main pathways of homocysteine metabolism are described, i.e. transsulfuration to cysteine and glutathione, as well as remethylation to methionine. Furthermore, formation of homocysteine thiolactone through editing mechanism with methionyl t-RNA syntethase and unusual reactivity of thiolactone against lysine epsilonNH2 groups of proteins as well as calcium dependent enzymatic hydrolysis of thiolactone are discussed. The effects of oxidative stress related to homocysteine are also reviewed. Finally, possible links of homocysteine to NO and arginine metabolism are discussed, including ADMA (N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine). The links between metabolism of homocysteine, adenosine and other nucleosides are emphasized. In conclusion, the N-homocysteilation of proteins with thiolactone changing enormously their properties seems to be the main reason of biotoxicity of homocysteine during atherosclerosis and other diseases.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcys) has been reported to participate in the development of arterial and glomerular sclerosis in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive (SS) rats. The mechanism resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia in these animals remains unknown. Disposal of Hcys in the kidneys plays an important role in regulating the plasma Hcys level. We, therefore, examined the activities and expressions of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of Hcys in the kidneys of SS rats, compared with that of Brown Norway rats and SSBN13 rats, a consomic subcolony of SS rats that carries a substituted chromosome 13 from Brown Norway rats. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that plasma Hcys levels were significantly higher in SS rats. The conversion of S-adenosylhomocysteine into Hcys via S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase by renal tissue was not different among these 3 rat strains. However, the metabolic rate of Hcys into cysteine was markedly reduced in the SS rat kidneys. The mRNA and protein levels of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), one of the key enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway in the kidneys, were significantly lower in SS rats. In microdissected nephron segments, CBS mRNA was shown to be mainly present in renal proximal tubules (PTs). The mRNA levels of CBS in the PTs were also significantly decreased in SS rats, accompanied by a reduced CBS activity in PTs. We conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a decreased activity and expression of CBS in renal PTs because of the defect of chromosome 13 in SS rats.</p>

<p>The transsulfuration pathway converts homocysteine to cysteine and represents the metabolic link between antioxidant and methylation metabolism. The first and committing step in this pathway is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which is subject to complex regulation, including allosteric activation by the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). In this study, we demonstrate that methionine restriction leads to a &gt;10-fold decrease in CBS protein levels, and pulse proteolysis studies reveal that binding of AdoMet stabilizes the protein against degradation by approximately 12 kcal/mol. These observations predict that under pathological conditions where AdoMet levels are diminished, CBS, and therefore glutathione levels, will be reduced. Indeed, we demonstrate this to be the case in a mouse model for spontaneous steatohepatitis in which the gene for the MAT1A isoenzyme encoding AdoMet synthetase has been disrupted, and in human hepatocellular carcinoma, where MAT1A is silenced. Furthermore, diminished CBS levels are associated with reduced cell viability in hepatoma cells challenged with tert-butyl hydroperoxide. This study uncovers a mechanism by which CBS is allosterically activated by AdoMet under normal conditions but is destabilized under pathological conditions, for redirecting the metabolic flux toward methionine conservation. A mechanistic basis for the coordinate changes in redox and methylation metabolism that are a hallmark of several complex diseases is explained by these observations.</p>

<p>The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) inhibits synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF), pyrimidines and purines, and induces differentiation in several cell types. At 1 microM, MTX reduced proliferation and induced differentiation in HT29 colon cancer cells; the latter effect was augmented (P &lt; 0.001) by thymidine (100 microM) but was reversed (P &lt; 0.001) by the purines, hypoxanthine (Hx; 100 microM) and adenosine (100 microM). In contrast 5-fluoro-uracil (5-FU), a specific thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor, had no effect on differentiation, suggesting that MTX-induced differentiation is not due to a reduction in thymidine but to the inhibition of purine biosynthesis. Inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) by RpcAMP (25 microM) further enhanced (P &lt; 0.001) MTX induced differentiation, whereas the cAMP activator forskolin (10 microM) reversed (P &lt; 0.001) MTX induced differentiation. These observations implicate a central role of adenosine and cAMP in MTX induced differentiation. By combining Western blot analysis with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)and HPLC analyses we also reveal both the expression and activity of key enzymes (i.e. methionine synthase (MS), s-adenosylhomocysteinase, cystathionine beta-synthase and ornithine decarboxylase) regulating methyl cycle, transsulfuration and polyamine pathways in HT29 colon cancer cells. At 1 microM, MTX induced differentiation was associated with a marked reduction in the intracellular concentrations of adenosine and, consequently, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine, polyamines and glutathione (GSH). Importantly, the marked reduction in methionine that accompanied MS inhibition following MTX treatment was non-limiting with respect to SAM synthesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that the effects of MTX on cellular differentiation and single carbon metabolism are primarily due to the intracellular depletion of purines.</p>

<p>Tumors frequently have abnormal L-methionine (Met) metabolism, the so-called Met-dependence phenotype that refers to the inability to proliferate in the absence of Met. However, the origin of this phenotype is still unknown and may arise from one of several pathways of Met metabolism. To help characterize the metabolic features of Met-dependent/independent phenotypes, the fate of the methyl carbon of L-[methyl-13C]Met was chased in a murine model of malignant melanoma (B16-F1) in vitro and in vivo. Growth curves under Met restriction showed that melanoma cells in vitro were Met-independent, whereas implanted melanoma tumors in vivo were Met-dependent. Label-assisted high-resolution magic angle spinning 1H-13C NMR spectroscopy metabolite profiling showed that, in vitro, creatine and phosphatidylcholine 13C-enrichments were poor, but S-adenosyl-Met and posttranslationally N-methylated protein signals were strong. In contrast, in vivo, creatine and phosphatidylcholine enrichments were strong but S-adenosyl-Met and N-methylated protein signals were poor. In addition, in vivo, transsulfuration was very efficient, consumed one-carbon units originating from the methyl carbon of Met, and yielded taurine labeling. From these data, the Met-dependent/independent phenotypes appear closely related to the source of one-carbon units. Thus, L-[methyl-13C]Met-assisted NMR spectroscopy metabolite profiling allowed the discrimination between Met-dependence and Met-independence and provided novel mechanistic information on their origin.</AbstractText>: Tumors frequently have abnormal L-methionine (Met) metabolism, the so-called Met-dependence phenotype that refers to the inability to proliferate in the absence of Met.

<p>BACKGROUND: Alterations in maternal folate and homocysteine metabolism are associated with neural tube defects (NTDs). The role played by specific micronutrients and metabolites in the causal pathway leading to NTDs is not fully understood.METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between NTDs and maternal alterations in plasma micronutrients and metabolites in two metabolic pathways: methionine remethylation and glutathione transsulfuration. Biomarkers were measured in a population-based sample of women who had NTD-affected pregnancies (n = 43) and a control group of women who had a pregnancy unaffected by a birth defect (n = 160). We compared plasma concentrations of folate, vitamin B(12), vitamin B(6), methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), adenosine, homocysteine, cysteine, and reduced and oxidized glutathione between cases and controls after adjusting for lifestyle and sociodemographic factors.RESULTS: Women with NTD-affected pregnancies had significantly higher plasma concentrations of SAH (29.12 vs. 23.13 nmol/liter, P = .0011), adenosine (0.323 vs. 0.255 mumol/liter; P = .0269), homocysteine (9.40 vs. 7.56 micromol/liter; P &lt; .001), and oxidized glutathione (0.379 vs. 0.262 micromol/liter; P = .0001), but lower plasma SAM concentrations (78.99 vs. 83.16 nmol/liter; P = .0172) than controls. This metabolic profile is consistent with reduced methylation capacity and increased oxidative stress in women with affected pregnancies.CONCLUSIONS: Increased maternal oxidative stress and decreased methylation capacity may contribute to the occurrence of NTDs. Further analysis of relevant genetic and environmental factors is required to define the basis for these observed alterations.</p>

<p>Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of significant cognitive disability. We hypothesize that by identifying metabolic alterations associated with cognitive impairment, it may be possible to develop medical or dietary interventions to ameliorate cognitive disabilities in persons with DS. Evidence suggests that one-carbon/transsulfuration (1C-TS) metabolism is abnormal in persons with DS. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) plays a critical role in this metabolic system. The gene for CBS is on human chromosome 21, and there is evidence of elevated CBS enzyme activity in tissues and cells from individuals with DS. To analyze the possible role of CBS in Down syndrome, we have produced several lines of transgenic mice expressing the human CBS gene. We describe the use of Florescence Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis to characterize the transgene insertion site for each line. Our initial expression analysis of each transgenic line by RT-PCR shows that the tissue specificity of human CBS mRNA levels in these mice may differ from the tissue specificity of mouse CBS mRNA levels in the same animals. These mice will be invaluable for assessing the regulation of the CBS gene and the role of CBS in cognition. They can also be used to develop therapies that target abnormalities in 1C-TS metabolism to improve cognition in persons with DS.</p>

<p>Long-lived Ames dwarf mice lack growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid stimulating hormone. Additionally the dwarf mice have enzyme activities and levels that combat oxidative stress more efficiently than those of normal mice. We have shown that methionine metabolism in Ames mice is markedly different than in their wild type littermates. In our previous work we hypothesized that the flux of methionine to the transsulfuration pathway is enhanced in the dwarf mice. The current study was designed to determine whether the flux of methionine to the transsulfuration pathway is increased. We did this by injecting either l-[methyl-(3)H]-methionine or l-[(35)S]-methionine into dwarf or normal mice and then determined retained label (in form of S-adenosylmethionine) 45 min later. The amount of retained hepatic (3)H and (35)S label was significantly reduced in the dwarf mice; at 45 min the specific radioactivity of SAM (pCi/nmol SAM) was 56% lower (p &lt; 0.05) for (3)H-label and 64% lower (p &lt; 0.005) for (35)S-label in dwarf than wild type mice. Retention of (35)S was significantly lower in the brain (37%, p &lt; .04) and kidney (47%, p &lt; 0.02) of the dwarf compared to wild type mice; there was no statistical difference in retained (3)H-label in either brain or kidney. This suggests that both the methyl-moiety and the carbon chain of methionine are lost much faster in the dwarf compared to the wild type mouse, implying that both transmethylation in the liver and transsulfuration in the liver, brain, and kidney are increased in the dwarf mice. As further support, we determined by real-time RT PCR the expression of methionine metabolism genes in livers of mice. Compared to wild type, the Ames dwarf had increased expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1a (2.3-fold, p = 0.013), glycine N-methyltransferase (3.8-fold, p = 0.023), betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (5.5-fold, p = 0.0006), S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (3.8-fold, p = 0.0005), and cystathionase (2.6-fold; tended to be increased, p = 0.055). Methionine synthase expression was significantly decreased in dwarf compared to wild type (0.48-fold, p = 0.023). These results confirm that the flux of methionine to transsulfuration is enhanced in the Ames dwarf. This, along with data from previous studies support the hypothesis that altered methionine metabolism plays a significant role in the oxidative defense of the dwarf mouse and that the mechanism for the enhanced oxidative defense may be through altered GSH metabolism as a result of the distinctive methionine metabolism.</p>

<p>We investigated hypohomocysteinemic action as a cardiovascular protective property of aged garlic extract (AGE). Hyperhomocysteinemia was induced in rats by feeding folate-depleted diets. Plasma folate concentrations of 5, 24, and 202 nmol/L were detected in rats fed a folate-deficient L-amino acid diet containing succinyl sulfathiazole, an AIN-93G folate-deficient diet, and an AIN-93G folate-sufficient diet, respectively. Plasma concentrations of total homocysteine were elevated to the highest level (32 micromol/L) by severe folate deficiency and to a moderate level (9 micromol/L) by mild folate deficiency, compared with the lowest level of (5 micromol/L), noted for the folate-sufficient group. The addition of AGE to the severely folate-deficient diet decreased plasma total homocysteine concentration by 30%. Hyperhomocysteinemia caused by mild folate deficiency remained unaltered by AGE supplementation. The reduction in total homocysteine of the severely folate-deficient rats was accompanied by a proportional decrease in protein-bound and free homocysteine, resulting in an unchanged protein-bound:free homocysteine ratio. AGE added to the diet did not alter plasma concentrations of other aminothiol compounds: cysteine, glutathione, and cysteinylglycine. These data, together with increased S-adenosylmethionine and decreased S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations in the liver, suggest that the hypohomocysteinemic effect of AGE most likely stems from impaired remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and enhanced transsulfuration of homocysteine to cystathionine. More importantly, in addition to its cholesterol-lowering potential, blood pressure-lowering effect, and antioxidant property, a hypohomocysteinemic action may be another important cardiovascular protective factor of AGE.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Inflammation is known to affect sulfur amino acid metabolism. Aging is associated with an increased prevalence of inflammatory conditions, but the metabolism of methionine has been poorly explored in the elderly.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to compare methionine kinetics between elderly and young subjects and to explore the effect of aging on the response to a mild inflammatory challenge induced by a vaccination.DESIGN: Seven elderly volunteers aged 66-76 y and 8 young volunteers aged 22-26 y were studied before and 2 d after a vaccination (diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, and typhoid vaccines). Methionine kinetics were measured by using an infusion of L-[1-13C, methyl-2H3]methionine in the postabsorptive and fed states.RESULTS: Before vaccination, the contribution of homocysteine remethylation to methionine-methyl flux (Qm) and the ratio of remethylation to homocysteine transsulfuration were significantly lower in the elderly subjects than in the young subjects (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the contribution of transsulfuration to methionine transmethylation was higher in the elderly (P &lt; 0.05). Vaccination significantly increased the ratio of transsulfuration to transmethylation and decreased the ratio of remethylation to Qm (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The preferential methionine metabolism toward cysteine synthesis observed after vaccination suggests an increased requirement of sulfur amino acids even in mild inflammatory situations. The main finding of this study is a higher proportion of methionine entering the transsulfuration pathway in elderly subjects before vaccination. This finding suggests an increased cysteine demand during aging.</p>

<p>Cysteine synthesis from homocysteine is catalyzed by two pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. This suggests that vitamin B-6 status might affect cysteine and glutathione homeostasis, but it is unclear whether this occurs in humans. We assessed the effects of vitamin B-6 status on static and kinetic parameters of cysteine and glutathione metabolism in healthy female (n=5) and male (n=4) volunteers (20-30 y) before and after 4 wk of dietary vitamin B-6 restriction (&lt;0.5 mg vitamin B-6/d). Rates of reactions related to cysteine metabolism were measured from blood sampled during primed, constant infusions of [(13)C(5)]methionine, [3-(13)C]serine, and [(2)H(2)]cysteine that were conducted after an overnight fast at baseline and after the dietary protocol. Vitamin B-6 restriction reduced the concentration of PLP (55.1+/- 8.3 vs. 22.6+/-1.3 nmol/L; P=0.004) and increased concentrations of cystathionine (124%; P&lt;0.001) and total glutathione (38%; P&lt;0.008) in plasma. Concentrations of plasma homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and C-reactive protein (an indicator of systemic inflammation) were not affected by dietary vitamin B-6 restriction. The rate of cysteine synthesis via transsulfuration was below detection limits in this protocol. Neither the fractional synthesis rate of cystathionine nor whole-body cysteine flux was affected by vitamin B-6 restriction. These data indicate that glutathione homeostasis is altered by dietary vitamin B-6 deficiency and appears to be unrelated to cysteine flux under conditions of minimal amino acid intake as evaluated in this study.</p>

<p>S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM, AdoMet) is the most important methyl donor used for synthesis of nucleic acids, phospholipids, creatine, and polyamines and for methylation of many bioactive molecules. The metabolic response of the lung to oxidative stress of hyperoxia requires increased RNA and protein synthesis for energy metabolism, growth arrest, and antioxidant defense. We studied the production of SAM and other aspects of methionine metabolism in lung epithelial cells exposed to hyperoxia. Human lung epithelial-like (A549) and primary small airway epithelial (SAE) cells were exposed to normoxia (21% O(2)) or hyperoxia (95% O(2)). Cell methionine and S-adenosylmethionine content increased in response to hyperoxia in SAE and A549 cells. Because methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, we examined the expression of a lung epithelial isoform of MAT 2A in hyperoxia. Western blots revealed a novel MAT 2A isoform expressed in both cell types, with a lower molecular mass than that described in Jurkat cells. Cloning and sequencing of the MAT 2A cDNA revealed one silent nucleotide substitution compared to that expressed in Jurkat. The lower mass of MAT 2A in both lung epithelial cells indicated that the absence of the major posttranslational modification of MAT 2A found in Jurkat. MAT 2A protein progressively increased during hyperoxic exposure in both transformed and primary lung epithelium. Increased flux of (13)C-labeled methionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in A549 demonstrated that SAM’s methyl group was utilized, and increased formation of cystathionine indicated that at least part of SAM generated was directed toward cysteine/GSH in the transsulfuration pathway. These results indicate activation of MAT 2A and the transmethylation pathway in the metabolic response to hyperoxia in lung epithelium.</p>

<p>Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are increased significantly in patients with moderate renal failure and increase markedly in patients with end-stage renal disease. An increase in plasma Hcy level theoretically could be caused by an increased production rate (ie, transmethylation), a decreased rate of removal by transsulfuration or remethylation, or a decrease in the excretion of Hcy. Current evidence indicates that the major mechanism for hyperhomocysteinemia in renal failure is a decrease in Hcy removal from the body. However, it is debated whether this effect is the result of a decrease in the renal metabolic clearance or a result of extrarenal metabolic changes. The human kidney plays a major role in the removal of several aminothiols or Hcy-related compounds from the circulation (eg, cysteine-glycine, glutathione, AdoMet, and AdoHcy). However, the glomerular filtration of Hcy seems to be restricted because of protein binding. Besides glomerular filtration, the normal kidney can remove Hcy by plasma flow and peritubular uptake. Although in the low normal range in absolute terms, the flow through the transsulfuration pathway is reduced if related to Hcy levels in uremia; in addition, the remethylation pathway also is impaired. Besides the potential effect of the reduced renal mass on Hcy removal, available evidence suggests the occurrence of a generalized down-regulation of the methionine cycle and catabolism in uremia. AdoHcy, sulfate, and dimethylglycine currently are being investigated as retained solutes that can inhibit 1 or more pathways of Hcy metabolism. In addition, the high Hcy levels decrease in malnourished end-stage renal disease patients and change according to nutrient intake and several other nutritional parameters, indicating that circulating Hcy levels become an expression of nutritional status.</p>

<p>Elevation of plasma homocysteine levels has been recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, a major complication of diabetes. Plasma homocysteine reflects a balance between its synthesis via S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methylation reactions and its removal through the transmethylation and the transsulfuration pathways. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT, EC 2.1.1.5) is one of the enzymes involved in the remethylation pathway. BHMT, a major zinc metalloenzyme in the liver, catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from betaine to homocysteine to form dimethylglycine and methionine. We have previously shown that plasma homocysteine levels and the transsulfuration pathway are affected by diabetes. In the present study, we found increased BHMT activity and mRNA levels in livers from streptozotocin-diabetic rats. In the rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE cells), glucocorticoids (triamcinolone) increased the level and rate of BHMT mRNA synthesis. In the same cell line, insulin decreased the abundance of BHMT mRNA and the rate of de novo mRNA transcription of the gene. Thus the decreased plasma homocysteine in various models of diabetes could be due to enhanced homocysteine removal brought about by a combination of increased transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine and increased remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by BHMT.</p>

<p>Several reports have appeared in the literature proving that hypothyroidism is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease. This increased risk for premature atherosclerosis is supported by autopsy and epidemiological studies in patients with thyroid hormone deficiency. Hypothyroid patients have increased diastolic blood pressure (as a result of increased systemic vascular resistance), altered lipid profile (elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B). More recently homocysteine, C-reactive protein, increased arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction and altered coagulation parameters have been recognized as a “new” risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with thyroid hormone deficiency. The plasma total homocysteine concentration, an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, is moderately elevated in overtly hypothyroid patients and it decreases with thyroid replacement therapy. Several experimental study have shown that hypothyroidism affects folate metabolism and the enzymes involved in the remetylation pathway of homocysteine (particularly 5,10-methylenotetrahydrofolate reductase - MTHFR). In hypothyroid condition the hepatic activity of flavoenzyme - MTHFR, is decreased. Thyroid hormone may affect the availability of FMN and FAD - necessary for stabilizing MTHFR. An impairment of enzyme involved in transsulfuration pathway is suggested. The increased serum creatinine level in hypothyroidism probably reflects a reduced glomerular filtration rate, which is linked to impaired renal homocysteine clearance and hyperhomocysteinemia.</p>

<p>Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for many diseases, including cardiovascular disease. We determined the effects of insulin resistance and of type 2 diabetes on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism using Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Gmi fa/fa and ZDF/Gmi fa/?). Plasma total Hcy was reduced in ZDF fa/fa rats by 24% in the pre-diabetic insulin-resistant stage, while in the frank diabetic stage there was a 59% reduction. Hepatic activities of several enzymes that play a role in the removal of Hcy:cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase, and betaine:Hcy methyltransferase (BHMT) were increased as was methionine adenosyltransferase. CBS and BHMT mRNA levels and the hepatic level of S-adenosylmethionine were also increased in the ZDF fa/fa rats. Studies with primary hepatocytes showed that Hcy export and the transsulfuration flux in cells from ZDF fa/fa rats were particularly sensitive to betaine. Interestingly, liver betaine concentration was found to be significantly lower in the ZDf fa/fa rats at both 5 and 11 weeks. These results emphasize the importance of betaine metabolism in determining plasma Hcy levels in type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Sulfur-containing amino acids play indispensable roles in a wide variety of biological activities including protein synthesis, methylation, and biosynthesis of polyamines and glutathione. Biosynthesis and catabolism of these amino acids need to be carefully regulated to achieve the requirement of the above-mentioned activities and also to eliminate toxicity attributable to the amino acids. Genome-wide analyses of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of sulfur-containing amino acids, including transsulfuration, sulfur assimilatory de novo cysteine biosynthesis, methionine cycle, and degradation, using genome databases available from a variety of parasitic protozoa, reveal remarkable diversity between protozoan parasites and their mammalian hosts. Thus, the sulfur-containing amino acid metabolic pathways are a rational target for the development of novel chemotherapeutic and prophylactic agents against diseases caused by protozoan parasites. These pathways also demonstrate notable heterogeneity among parasites, suggesting that the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids reflects the diversity of parasitism among parasite species, and probably influences their biology and pathophysiology such as virulence competence and stress defense.</p>

<p>The role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) as a risk marker for cardiovascular diseases in renal patients is a matter of controversy. The remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine in the kidneys is of great importance for Hcy clearance. Hcy remethylation is markedly decreased in patients on hemodialysis, but transsulfuration remains mostly unaffected. Markedly increased concentrations of methylmalonic acid (MMA), as a metabolic marker of vitamin B12 deficiency, have been found in approximately 70% of renal patients. This is in contrast to normal concentrations of vitamin B12 usually reported in such patients. We demonstrated in cell culture experiments that the uptake of vitamin B12 by mononuclear cells from renal patients was lower than that taken up by cells from controls. The lowering of MMA and Hcy concentrations in renal patients after B12 administration may indicate the presence of intracellular pre-treatment deficiency. We administered folic acid (5 mg) plus vitamin B6 (50 mg) and B12 (0.7 mg) three times per week intravenously to hyperhomocysteinemic dialysis patients. Hcy decreased after 4 weeks by 51%. Hcy was normalized in almost all patients, while serum concentrations of MMA and cystathionine were reduced by 28% and 26%, respectively. Cystathionine, an indicator for the transsulfuration pathway, showed a drastic increase in renal disease and was only slightly lowered by B-vitamin treatment. The increased cystathionine/cysteine ratio in renal patients indicates possible impairment of the catabolism of cystathionine by cystathionase. Moreover, renal failure is associated with severe abnormalities in plasma concentrations of S-adenosyl Hcy (SAH) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), as well as the SAM/SAH ratio. This ratio is an indicator of the availability of methyl groups from SAM. Therapeutic doses of B-vitamins in dialysis patients led to a limited improvement in the biomarkers of methylation and probably did not have a significant effect on transmethylation potential in the cells. Furthermore, elevated serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in renal patients, which are associated with a poor outcome for such patients, could be lowered, but this effect was confined to patients who had no anemia. Future studies may consider extending the duration of vitamin treatment, as well as agents that may enhance the hydrolysis of SAH and cystathionine.</p>

<p>Although hyperhomocysteinemia, an independent cardiovascular risk factor, is common in type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, the mechanism(s) of this alteration is not known. In healthy humans, hyperinsulinemia increases methionine transmethylation, homocysteine transsulfuration, and clearance. No such data exist in type 2 diabetes either in the fasting state or in response to hyperinsulinemia. To this purpose, seven male type 2 diabetic patients with albuminuria (1.2 +/- 0.4 g/day, three with mild to moderate renal insufficiency) and seven matched control subjects were infused for 6 h with L-[methyl-(2)H(3), 1-(13)C]methionine. Methionine flux, transmethylation, and disposal into proteins as well as homocysteine remethylation, transsulfuration, and clearance were determined before and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (approximately 1,000 pmol/l). In type 2 diabetic subjects, homocysteine concentration was twofold greater (P &lt; 0.01) and methionine transmethylation and homocysteine clearance lower (from approximately 15 to &gt;50% and from approximately 40 to &gt;100%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) than in control subjects. The insulin-induced increments of methionine transmethylation, homocysteine transsulfuration, and clearance were markedly reduced in type 2 diabetic subjects (by more than threefold, P &lt; 0.05 or less vs. control subjects). In contrast, methionine methyl and carbon flux were not increased in the patients. In conclusion, pathways of homocysteine disposal are impaired in type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, both in postabsorptive and insulin-stimulated states, possibly accounting for the hyperhomocysteinemia of this condition.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Women who have had pregnancies that were affected by nonsyndromic congenital heart defects have alterations in the homocysteine-methionine pathway that may indicate increased exposure to oxidative stress or reduced antioxidant defense or both.OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to establish a maternal metabolic risk profile for nonsyndromic congenital heart defects that would enhance current preventive strategies.DESIGN: Using a case-control design, we measured biomarkers of the transsulfuration pathway in a population-based sample of women whose pregnancies were affected by congenital heart defects (331 cases) and in a control group of women (125 controls). Plasma concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione, vitamin B-6, homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine (CysGly), and glutamylcysteine (GluCys) were compared between cases and controls after adjustment for lifestyle and sociodemographic variables.RESULTS: After covariate adjustment, cases had significantly lower mean plasma concentrations of reduced glutathione (P &lt; 0.0001), GluCys (P &lt; 0.0001), and vitamin B-6 (P = 0.0023) and significantly higher mean concentrations of homocysteine (P &lt; 0.0001) and oxidized glutathione (P &lt; 0.0001) than did controls.CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of oxidative stress involved in the transsulfuration pathway were significantly higher in women with pregnancies affected by congenital heart defects than in women without such a history. Further analysis of relevant biomarkers of oxidative stress and genetic and environmental factors is required to define the basis for the observed alterations. Identifying the nature and extent of alterations in biomarkers of oxidative stress may suggest primary intervention strategies and provide clues to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of congenital heart defects.</p>

<p>3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) (EC 2.8.1.2), a multifunctional enzyme, catalyzes a transsulfuration from mercaptopyruvate to pyruvate in the degradation process of cysteine. A stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide and of tetrathionate (S(4)O(6)(2-)) inhibited rat MST (k(i) = 3.3 min(-1), K(i) = 120.5 microM and k(i) = 2.5 min(-1), K(i) = 178.6 microM, respectively). The activity was completely restored by dithiothreitol or thioredoxin with a reducing system containing thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, but glutathione did not restore the activity. On the other hand, an excess molar ratio dose of hydrogen peroxide inactivated MST. Oxidation with a stoichiometric concentration of hydrogen peroxide protected the enzyme against reaction by iodoacetate, which modifies a catalytic Cys(247), suggesting that Cys(247) is a target of the oxidants. A matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis revealed that hydrogen peroxide- and tetrathionate-inhibited MSTs were increased in molecular mass consistent with the addition of atomic oxygen and with a thiosulfate (S(2)O(3)(-)), respectively. Treatment with dithiothreitol restored modified MST to the original mass. These findings suggested that there was no nearby cysteine with which to form a disulfide, and mild oxidation of MST resulted in formation of a sulfenate (SO(-)) at Cys(247), which exhibited exceptional stability and a lower redox potential than that of glutathione. Oxidative stress decreases MST activity so as to increase the amount of cysteine, a precursor of thioredoxin or glutathione, and furthermore, these cellular reductants restore the activity. Thus the redox state regulates MST activity at the enzymatic level, and on the other hand, MST controls redox to maintain cellular redox homeostasis.</p>

<p>In this study, we attempted to evaluate changes in sulfur-containing amino acid (SCAA) metabolism after short-term high-dose alcohol ingestion. At the beginning of the study, six animals were sacrificed as the baseline group and then other animals in the experiment were consecutively gavaged with alcohol (30%, 3 g/kg) for 7 days. Animals (n=6 each) were subsequently sacrificed at the time points of Days 1 (Group E1), 3 (Group E3) and 7 (Group E7). Blood samples and selected tissues were collected at each time interval. SCAA, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and glutathione (GSH) levels were analyzed. Results showed that taurine levels of tissues (brain, liver, heart and kidneys) all declined after the ethanol intervention and continued to decrease in selected tissues except the brain during the experiment. Furthermore, the trends of plasma taurine and PLP contents were highly correlated (r=.98, P=.045). A similar utilization pattern of plasma taurine and PLP indicated that transsulfuration preferred taurine production to GSH synthesis. The trend of plasma taurine levels being positively correlated with PLP levels reveals that dramatic transsulfuration occurred to meet the urgent demand for taurine by brain cells. In conclusion, we reported that continual alcohol ingestion alters SCAA utilization, especially by depletion of taurine and hypotaurine and by elevation of S-adenosyl homocysteine in the selected organs.</p>

<p>Renal insufficiency is invariably accompanied by elevated plasma concentrations of the sulfur-containing and potentially vasculotoxic amino acid homocysteine. There is a strong relationship between glomerular filtration rate and plasma homocysteine concentration. Unlike creatinine, however, homocysteine is avidly reabsorbed in the renal tubules, and its urinary excretion is minimal. There is no evidence that homocysteine is actively removed by the human kidney. In renal insufficiency, plasma concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine, and sulfate are elevated, pointing to a remethylation or distal transsulfuration/oxidation block as the cause of hyperhomocysteinemia in renal failure. Stable isotope techniques have shown that both whole-body homocysteine remethylation and methionine transmethylation are decreased in renal failure, whereas homocysteine transsulfuration seems intact. Metabolic homocysteine clearance (i.e., transsulfuration relative to plasma homocysteine) is decreased to a major extent. These metabolic disturbances in renal failure can only be partially restored with current treatments. Folic acid treatment lowers plasma homocysteine concentration and increases remethylation and transmethylation rates. Plasma homocysteine, however, is not normalized, and metabolic homocysteine clearance by transsulfuration remains impaired. According to the currently available data, effective normalization of plasma homocysteine can only be obtained when its metabolic clearance through transsulfuration is restored.</p>

Homocysteine remethylation, transsulfuration, and export to the blood/extracellular compartment determine homocysteine concentrations. Any disturbance in these routes may lead to Hhcy and potentially increase risk of disease. In this report, we aim to review all known polymorphisms involved in homocysteine and B-vitamin metabolism that have been assessed for their effect on tHcy. In the last section, we summarize the polymorphisms, for which the obtained data provides evidence for their involvement in Hhcy at the population level, and discuss how to continue our search for genetic determinants of tHcy.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is derived from the essential amino acid methionine and plays a vital role in cellular homeostasis in man. Homocysteine levels depend on its synthesis, involving methionine adenosyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases such as glycine N-methyltransferase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; its remethylation to methionine by methionine synthase, which requires methionine synthase reductase, vitamin B (12), and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate produced by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or betaine methyltransferase; and its degradation by transsulfuration involving cystathionine beta-synthase. The control of homocysteine metabolism involves changes of tissue content or inherent kinetic properties of the enzymes. In particular, S-adenosylmethionine acts as a switch between remethylation and transsulfuration through its allosteric inhibition of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and activation of cystathionine beta-synthase. Mutant alleles of genes for these enzymes can lead to severe loss of function and varying severity of disease. Several defects lead to severe hyperhomocysteinemia, the most common form being cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, with more than a hundred reported mutations. Less severe elevations of plasma homocysteine are caused by folate and vitamin B (12) deficiency, and renal disease and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with several common disease states such as cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine toxicity is likely direct or caused by disturbed levels of associated metabolites; for example, methylation reactions through elevated S-adenosylhomocysteine.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a thyol amino acid resulting from de-methylation of methionine, an essential amino acid derived from dietary proteins. It is metabolized through two pathways: re-methylation and transsulfuration, which use as cofactors folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease, dementia, impaired cognitive function and depression. Several drugs may interfere with metabolic pathways of Hcy, leading to an alteration of plasma Hcy levels. Lipid-lowering agents, used to reduce the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis or occlusive vascular disease in patients with high levels of plasmatic lipids, can increase plasma Hcy levels. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been also documented in Parkinson disease patients treated with levodopa and in epileptic patients after chronic treatment with antiepileptic drugs. In contrast, vitamins supplementations may be warranted in patients treated with lipid-lowering agents, levodopa and antiepileptic drugs in order to maintain normal plasma Hcy values. In contrast, higher doses of vitamins can induce dysfunctions in central and peripheral nervous system; therefore excessive supplements should be avoided.</p>

<p>The effect of fasting on mouse liver methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT I/ III) expression and the regulation of methionine metabolism were investigated. The mRNA level, protein level, and activity of MAT I/III were increased by fasting for 10 or 16 h. In spite of the increase of MAT I/III activity, S-adenosylmethionine, the product of methionine due to MAT I/III, decreased. S-Adenosylhomocysteine, which is made from S-adenosylmethionine by its coupling to methyltransferase, increased as a result of fasting for 16 h. These results suggest that the total methylation reactions using S-adenosylmethionine are stimulated in the fasting mouse liver. However, the DNA methylation level was not changed by fasting for 16 h. Glutathione, which is made by the transsulfuration pathway from homocysteine, decreased due to fasting. Regulation of supplementation of S-adenosylmethionine may occur in the fasting mouse because MAT I/III activity increases and the flow to glutathione is decreased.</p>

<p>The metabolism of sulfur amino acids, methionine and cysteine, has been linked to several key aspects of human health and cellular function. In addition, the metabolism of dietary amino acids by the gastrointestinal tract is nutritionally important for normal function. In the case of sulfur amino acids (SAAs), in vivo, stable isotope studies in adults suggest that the splanchnic tissues utilize as much as 30-44% of the dietary methionine and cysteine. Similarly, the dietary methionine requirement is 30% lower in total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-fed piglets, a condition in which dietary nutrients largely bypass intestinal metabolism. These data suggest that intestinal metabolism of methionine is substantial, yet the intestinal metabolic fate of dietary methionine is largely unknown. Dietary cysteine likely plays a key role in intestinal epithelial antioxidant function as a precursor for glutathione. Moreover, cysteine and glutathione may also regulate epithelial cell proliferation via modulation of redox status. Recent evidence indicates that transformed colonic epithelial cells are capable of methionine transmethylation and transsulfuration. This review discusses the evidence of intestinal SAA metabolism and how this affects nutrient requirements and epithelial function.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is the first enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, catalyzing the conversion of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine and water. The enzyme contains three functional domains. The middle domain contains the catalytic core, which is responsible for the pyridoxal phosphate-catalyzed reaction. The C-terminal domain contains a negative regulatory region that is responsible for allosteric activation of the enzyme by S-adenosylmethionine. The N-terminal domain contains heme, and this domain regulates the enzyme in response to redox conditions. Besides its canonical reaction, CBS can catalyze alternative reactions that produce hydrogen sulfide, a novel neuromodulator in the brain. Mutations in human CBS result in homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in a variety of different organ systems. The most common CBS allele is 833T&gt;C (I278T), which is associated with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria. A complementation system in S. cerevisiae has been developed for analysis of human CBS mutations. Using this system, it has been discovered that deletion of the C-terminal domain of CBS can suppress the functional defects of many patient-derived mutations.

<p>AIMS: We previously reported that acute betaine treatment induced significant changes in the hepatic glutathione and cysteine levels in mice and rats. The present study was aimed to determine the effects of dietary betaine on the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids.RESULTS: Male mice were supplemented with betaine (1%) in drinking water for up to 3 weeks. Changes in hepatic levels of major sulfur amino acid metabolites and products were stabilized after 2 weeks of betaine supplementation. Betaine intake increased methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine levels significantly, but homocysteine and cystathionine were reduced. Methionine adenosyltransferase activity was elevated to three-fold of control. Cysteine catabolism to taurine was inhibited as evidenced by a decrease in cysteine dioxygenase activity and taurine levels in liver and plasma. Despite the significant changes in the transsulfuration reactions, neither hepatic cysteine nor glutathione was altered. Betaine supplementation decreased the hepatotoxicity induced by chloroform (0.5 ml/kg, ip) significantly.CONCLUSIONS: Betaine supplementation enhances recycling of homocysteine for the generation of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine while reducing its utilization for the synthesis of cystathionine and cysteine. However, the hepatic levels of cysteine or glutathione are not affected, most probably due to the depression of taurine generation from cysteine.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma homocysteine has been linked to pregnancy complications and developmental diseases. Whereas hyperhomocysteinemia is frequently observed in populations at risk of malnutrition, hypoxia may alter the remethylation of homocysteine in hepatocytes. We aimed to investigate the combined influences of early deficiency in nutritional determinants of hyperhomocysteinemia and of neonatal hypoxia on homocysteine metabolic pathways in developing rats. Dams were fed a standard diet or a diet deficient in vitamins B12, B2, folate, month, and choline from 1 mo before pregnancy until weaning of the offspring. The pups were divided into four treatment groups corresponding to “no hypoxia/standard diet,” “hypoxia (100% N2 for 5 min at postnatal d 1)/standard diet,” “no hypoxia/deficiency,” and “hypoxia/deficiency,” and homocysteine metabolism was analyzed in their liver at postnatal d 21. Hypoxia increased plasma homocysteine in deficient pups (21.2 +/- 1.6 versus 13.3 +/- 1.2 microM, p &lt; 0.05). Whereas mRNA levels of cystathionine beta-synthase remained unaltered, deficiency reduced the enzyme activity (48.7 +/- 2.9 versus 83.6 +/- 6.3 nmol/h/mg, p &lt; 0.01), an effect potentiated by hypoxia (29.4 +/- 4.7 nmol/h/mg, p &lt; 0.05). The decrease in methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase activity measured in deficient pups was attenuated by hypoxia (p &lt; 0.05), and methionine-adenosyltransferase activity was slightly reduced only in the “hypoxia/deficiency” group (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, hypoxia enhanced the deficiency-induced drop of the S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, which is known to influence DNA methylation and gene expression. In conclusion, neonatal hypoxia may increase homocysteinemia mainly by decreasing homocysteine transsulfuration in developing rats under methyl-deficient regimen. It could therefore potentiate the well-known adverse effects of hyperhomocysteinemia.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia, or the rise of plasmatic homocysteine levels above 15 mug/dL, is accepted nowadays as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in men and women. Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non-protein forming aminoacid (aa) derivated from the loss of the methyl group, found within methionine. Methionine regenerates by retrieving the methyl radical from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) creating tetrahydrofolate (THF) which will then regenerate to 5-MTHF through the action of methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). This process is called remethylation. Alternatively, Hcy can follow the transsulfuration route, where through cystationine-beta-syntetase (CBS), it irreversibly converted into cystationine, a precursor of cysteine, glutathione, and other substances that are finally excreted in the urine. Hyperhomocysteinemia results from inhibition of the remethylation route, or inhibition or saturation of the transsulfuration pathway. Main factors causally associated increased plasmatic Hcy are mutations of the enzymes MTHFR and CBS; varying nutritional and health states; demographic factors; and, others. The most accepted hypotheses about Hcy action in cardiovascular disease are direct endothelial and vessel wall damage; oxidative stress generation; and, stimulation of a procoagulant and proinflammatory state of blood components. Since hyperhomocysteinemia can be effectively treated with folic acid, prospective trials are underway to determine if folate therapy is required to lower Hcy levels in plasma. These studies also attempt to address the impact, if any, of folate therapy in the reduction of cardiovascular risk, and to demonstrate if hyperhomocysteinemia is actually an independent risk factor that can be effectively treated.</p>

<p>Methionine metabolism provides two key cellular reagents: S-adenosylmethionine and glutathione, derived from the common intermediate, homocysteine. A majority of cancer cells exhibit a methionine-dependent phenotype whereby they are unable to grow in medium in which methionine is replaced by its precursor, homocysteine. Additionally, CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters is observed in a background of global hypomethylation in cancerous cells. In this study, we have profiled the expression levels of the homocysteine junction enzymes, methionine synthase (MS), MS reductase (MSR), and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) in the NCI60 panel of cancer cell lines. The doubling time of non-small lung cell cancer lines, which exhibit the lowest levels of MS within the panel, was significantly correlated with expression of MS. The ratio of MS to MSR varied over a 5-fold range in the different cell types, which may modulate methionine synthesis. Interestingly, markedly reduced CBS expression was seen in the methionine-dependent prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, but not in the methionine-independent cell line, DU-145. However, neither provision of the transsulfuration pathway product, cysteine, nor overexpression of CBS rescued the growth impairment, indicating that reduced CBS was not responsible for the methionine-dependent phenotype in this cell line.</p>

<p>Plasma homocysteine concentration exhibits a strong relationship with (indices of) renal function. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been implicated in the high vascular event rate in patients with chronic renal failure. The precise pathophysiological explanation for the occurrence of hyperhomocysteinemia in renal failure is not yet elucidated. A defective intrinsic renal metabolism of homocysteine seems unlikely. There are several indications that whole body homocysteine metabolism is altered in renal insufficiency. Stable isotope studies in dialysis patients have shown a decreased homocysteine clearance by transsulfuration and decreased homocysteine remethylation and methionine transmethylation. Several, but not all, prospective studies have linked hyperhomocysteinemia to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in renal failure patients. Treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in renal insufficiency is based on folic acid-containing regimens, but so far, none of the regimens has been shown to successfully normalize plasma homocysteine concentration. Intervention studies have not yet demonstrated beneficial vascular effects of homocysteine-lowering treatment in dialysis patients.</p>

<p>Estrogens, both endogenous and exogenous, lower the fasting levels of the independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease homocysteine. The mechanism behind this observation remains unclear. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 25 postmenopausal women with a screening homocysteine concentration above 10 micromol/liter were included. We investigated the influence on homocysteine levels of a 3-month treatment with a daily oral dose of 4 mg 17beta-estradiol (ET) or 4 mg ET combined with 10 mg dydrogesterone (EPT); the comparison group received placebo treatment. We performed primed continuous infusions of L-[2H3-methyl-13C]methionine to assess steady-state flux rates of transmethylation, remethylation, and transsulfuration. Homocysteine concentration relationships with S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, creatinine, albumin, vitamins B6 and B12, and folate status were determined as well. The mean change from baseline in homocysteine concentration by both treatments compared with placebo (ET, -13%; EPT, -10%) was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of vitamin B6 (ET, -25%; EPT, -38%) and albumin (ET, -7%; EPT, -11%). No significant changes in flux rates were observed. In a .multiltivariate analysis, changes in homocysteine concentration were related to changes in albumin concentration. No relation to other variables was observed. We conclude that the ET- and EPT-induced homocysteine changes in this study were not accompanied by a significant change in methionine-homocysteine flux rates and hypothesize that an estrogen-induced lowering of homocysteine levels is primarily part of a change in albumin metabolism.</p>

<p>Methionine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is reversibly converted into homocysteine. Homocysteine is an independent cardiovascular risk factor frequently associated with the insulin resistance syndrome. The effects of insulin on methionine and homocysteine kinetics in vivo are not known. Six middle-aged male volunteers were infused with L-[methyl-2H3,1-13C]methionine before (for 3 h) and after (for 3 additional hours) an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (150 mU/l) clamp. Steady-state methionine and homocysteine kinetics were determined using either plasma (i.e., those of methionine) or intracellular (i.e., those of plasma homocysteine) enrichments. By use of plasma enrichments, insulin decreased methionine rate of appearance (Ra; both methyl- and carbon Ra) by 25% (P &lt; 0.003 vs. basal) and methionine disposal into proteins by 50% (P &lt; 0.0005), whereas it increased homocysteine clearance by approximately 70% (P &lt; 0.025). With intracellular enrichments, insulin increased all kinetic rates, mainly because homocysteine enrichment decreased by approximately 40% (P &lt; 0.001). In particular, transmethylation increased sixfold (P &lt; 0.02), transsulfuration fourfold (P = 0.01), remethylation eightfold (P &lt; 0.025), and clearance eightfold (P &lt; 0.004). In summary, 1) physiological hyperinsulinemia stimulated homocysteine metabolic clearance irrespective of the model used; and 2) divergent changes in plasma methionine and homocysteine enrichments were observed after hyperinsulinemia, resulting in different changes in methionine and homocysteine kinetics. In conclusion, insulin increases homocysteine clearance in vivo and may thus prevent homocysteine accumulation in body fluids. Use of plasma homocysteine as a surrogate of intracellular methionine enrichment, after acute perturbations such as insulin infusion, needs to be critically reassessed.</p>

<p>The finding that a lens under oxidative stress accumulated free and protein-bound cysteine (protein-S-S-cysteine) in the fiber cells prompted us to examine if there is an alternative source for cysteine pools besides the active cysteine transport system in the lens, namely, the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine-cystathionine-cysteine, which utilises methionine through transmethylation. We examined the presence of the gene for cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), the rate limiting enzyme that converts homocysteine to cystathionine in the transsulfuration pathway, in human lens epithelial (HLE) B3 cells using PCR with primers designed based on the sequence of human liver CBS (Forward 5’-CCA CAC TGC CCC GGC AAA AT-3’; Reverse 5’-CTG GCA ATG CCC GTG ATG GT-3’). The purified DNA fragment (586 bp) from PCR analysis was sequenced and confirmed the homology with CBS gene from other human tissues. The CBS protein band (67 kDa) was present in the HLE cells, which reacted positively with the human liver anti-CBS antibody. The enzyme protein was detected in the pig and human lenses with the highest intensity in the epithelial layer, lower but equal quantities of CBS was present in the cortical and nuclear regions. Human nuclear CBS increased while epithelial CBS decreased with aging. Oxidative stress transiently upregulated the gene expression of CBS both in HLE cells (0.1 mMH2O2) and in pig lens cultured in TC 199 medium (0.5 mMH2O2). The catalytic activity for CBS, which was assayed by measuring the production of C14-cystathionine from C14-serine in the presence of homocysteine, S-adenosyl-methionine and pyridoxal phosphate, was detectable in the HLE cells and transiently activated with H2O2. Free cystathionine accumulated when HLE B3 cells were treated with propargylglycine (PGG), an inhibitor of cystathionase, the downstream enzyme that converts cystathionine to cysteine. More cystathionine accumulation occurred when the cells were simultaneously exposed to PGG and 0.1 mMH2O2. We have shown that oxidative stress of H2O2 could increase the flux of this transsulfuration pathway by committing more homocysteine to cysteine and glutathione production as H2O2 (0.1 mM) inhibited the remethylation enzyme of methionine synthase while concurrently activating the CBS enzyme. This is the first evidence that a transsulfuration pathway is present in the lens, and that it can be upregulated under oxidative stress to provide additional redox potential for the cells.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of hyperhomocysteinemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unclear. Folic acid lowers, but does not normalize, the plasma homocysteine level in patients with ESRD, but its effect on whole body metabolism of homocysteine is unknown.METHODS: We studied the effect of 3 weeks of oral treatment with 5 mg folic acid per day on homocysteine metabolism in six chronic hemodialysis patients and six healthy controls. Primed, continuous infusions with [(2)H(3)-methyl-1-(13)C] methionine were used to determine flux rates of methionine transmethylation, homocysteine remethylation, and homocysteine transsulfuration. Metabolic homocysteine clearance was defined as the ratio of transsulfuration and plasma homocysteine level.RESULTS: Folic acid treatment lowered plasma homocysteine significantly by 39% (95% CI 5 to 73) in the ESRD group, but plasma homocysteine remained higher than baseline values in the control group. In ESRD patients, homocysteine remethylation and methionine transmethylation rate increased by 34% (95% CI 5 to 62) and 22% (95% CI 5 to 39), respectively (i.e., levels that were similar to the baseline values of the control group). Transsulfuration rate and metabolic homocysteine clearance were not significantly altered by folic acid treatment in both the ESRD and the control group.CONCLUSION: In ESRD patients, folic acid treatment lowers, but does not normalize plasma homocysteine, whereas homocysteine remethylation and methionine transmethylation increase to levels found in untreated healthy controls. These findings indicate a persistent, folate-independent, defect in metabolic homocysteine clearance in ESRD.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that usually presents in early childhood and that is thought to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Although abnormal metabolism of methionine and homocysteine has been associated with other neurologic diseases, these pathways have not been evaluated in persons with autism.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma concentrations of metabolites in the methionine transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways in children diagnosed with autism.DESIGN: Plasma concentrations of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), adenosine, homocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine, and oxidized and reduced glutathione were measured in 20 children with autism and in 33 control children. On the basis of the abnormal metabolic profile, a targeted nutritional intervention trial with folinic acid, betaine, and methylcobalamin was initiated in a subset of the autistic children.RESULTS: Relative to the control children, the children with autism had significantly lower baseline plasma concentrations of methionine, SAM, homocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine, and total glutathione and significantly higher concentrations of SAH, adenosine, and oxidized glutathione. This metabolic profile is consistent with impaired capacity for methylation (significantly lower ratio of SAM to SAH) and increased oxidative stress (significantly lower redox ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione) in children with autism. The intervention trial was effective in normalizing the metabolic imbalance in the autistic children.CONCLUSIONS: An increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and a decreased capacity for methylation may contribute to the development and clinical manifestation of autism.</p>

<p>For decades it has been well known that elevated levels of homocysteine are harmful to humans on the basis of clinical observations derived from classical model diseases, such as inherited metabolic disorders. This group of diseases includes classical homocystinuria and several other inherited diseases affecting the so-called ‘transsulfuration pathways’. Homocysteine lies in a metabolic checkpoint that interconnects one-carbon-transferring reactions with metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, since every molecule of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate derived either from plasma or generated from other folate species must be demethylated to liberate the reduced tetrahydrofolate. This unidirectional mechanism operates in every cell and has no alternative in eukaryotic cells. Antifolates are a group of anticancer agents targeting various metabolic steps within folate metabolism. They exert an indirect influence on the rate of appearance/disappearance of homocysteine from cellular and plasma compartments. Recently, it has been postulated that homocysteine may be a marker of the ‘pharmacodynamic effect’ of methotrexate, but studies attesting to this role are only now emerging. Here, we explore the genetic disease of folate and homocysteine metabolism and discuss the links between these model disorders with pharmacology and pharmacogenetics of folate antagonists used in the clinic. We outline possible ways of how homocysteine may be used as a biomarker of antifolate therapy.</p>

<p>The ability of enzymes to catalyze specific reactions, while excluding others, is central to cellular metabolism. Control of reaction specificity is of particular importance for enzymes that employ catalytically versatile cofactors, of which pyridoxal 5’-phosphate is a prime example. Cystathionine gamma-synthase and cystathionine beta-synthase are the first enzymes in the transsulfuration and reverse transsulfuration pathways, respectively. Each of them occupies branch-point positions in amino acid metabolism and as such are subject to transcriptional and post-translational regulation. Both enzymes catalyze the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate-dependent formation of l-cystathionine; however, their substrate and reaction specificities are distinct. The mechanisms whereby these enzymes control the chemistry of the cofactor are the subject of this review.</p>

<p>Methionine can be used as the sole sulfur source by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex although it is not obvious from examination of the genome annotation how these bacteria utilize methionine. Given that genome annotation is a largely predictive process, key challenges are to validate these predictions and to fill in gaps for known functions for which genes have not been annotated. We have addressed these issues by functional analysis of methionine metabolism. Transport, followed by metabolism of (35)S methionine into the cysteine adduct mycothiol, demonstrated the conversion of exogenous methionine to cysteine. Mutational analysis and cloning of the Rv1079 gene showed it to encode the key enzyme required for this conversion, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL). Rv1079, annotated metB, was predicted to encode cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS), but demonstration of a gamma-elimination reaction with cystathionine as well as the gamma-replacement reaction yielding cystathionine showed it encodes a bifunctional CGL/CGS enzyme. Consistent with this, a Rv1079 mutant could not incorporate sulfur from methionine into cysteine, while a cysA mutant lacking sulfate transport and a methionine auxotroph was hypersensitive to the CGL inhibitor propargylglycine. Thus, reverse transsulfuration alone, without any sulfur recycling reactions, allows M. tuberculosis to use methionine as the sole sulfur source. Intracellular cysteine was undetectable so only the CGL reaction occurs in intact mycobacteria. Cysteine desulfhydrase, an activity we showed to be separable from CGL/CGS, may have a role in removing excess cysteine and could explain the ability of M. tuberculosis to recycle sulfur from cysteine, but not methionine.</p>

<p>The enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway also have the capacity to catalyze the desulfhydration of cysteine. Recent studies demonstrate a role of the transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine gamma-lyase and cystathionine beta-synthase, in catalyzing the desulfhydration of cysteine in brain and smooth muscle. The H2S produced from cysteine functions as a neuromodulator and smooth muscle relaxant. In glutamatergic neurons, the production of H2S by cystathionine beta-synthase enhances N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated currents. In smooth muscle cells, H2S produced by cystathionine gamma-lyase enhances the outward flux of potassium by opening potassium channels, leading to hyperpolarization of membrane potential and smooth muscle relaxation.</p>

<p>In alcoholic liver disease, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is a critical effector molecule, and abnormal methionine metabolism is a fundamental acquired metabolic abnormality. Although hepatocytes are resistant to TNFalpha-induced killing under normal circumstances, previous studies have shown that primary hepatocytes from rats chronically fed alcohol have increased TNFalpha cytotoxicity. Therefore, there must be mechanisms by which chronic alcohol exposure “sensitizes” to TNFalpha hepatotoxicity. S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is product of methionine in transsulfuration pathway and a potent competitive inhibitor of most methyltransferases. In this study, we investigated the effects of increased SAH levels on TNFalpha hepatotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that chronic alcohol consumption in mice not only decreased hepatic S-adenosylmethionine levels but also increased hepatic SAH levels, which resulted in a significantly decreased S-adenosylmethionine-to-SAH ratio. This was associated with significant increases in hepatic TNFalpha levels, caspase-8 activity, and cell death. In vitro studies demonstrated that SAH-enhancing agents sensitized hepatocytes to TNFalpha killing, and the death was associated with increased caspase-8 activity, which was blocked by a caspase-8 inhibitor. In addition, increased intracellular SAH levels had no effect on nuclear factor kappaB activity induced by TNFalpha. In conclusion, these results provide a new link between abnormal methionine metabolism and abnormal TNFalpha metabolism in alcoholic liver disease. Increased SAH is a potent and clinically relevant sensitizer to TNFalpha hepatotoxicity. These data further support improving the S-adenosylmethionine-to-SAH ratio and removal of intracellular SAH as potential therapeutic options in alcoholic liver disease.</p>

<p>The hepatic enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) plays a major role in the control of methyl group and homocysteine metabolism. Because disruption of these vital pathways is associated with numerous pathologies, understanding GNMT control is important for evaluating methyl group regulation. Recently, gluconeogenic conditions have been shown to modulate homocysteine metabolism and treatment with glucocorticoids and/or all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-induced active GNMT protein, thereby leading to methyl group loss. This study was conducted to determine the effect of diabetes, alone and in combination with RA, on GNMT regulation. Diabetes and RA increased GNMT activity 87 and 148%, respectively. Moreover, the induction of GNMT activity by diabetes and RA was reflected in its abundance. Cell culture studies demonstrated that pretreatment with insulin prevented GNMT induction by both RA and dexamethasone. There was a significant decline in homocysteine concentrations in diabetic rats, owing in part to a 38% increase in the abundance of the transsulfuration enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase; treatment of diabetic rats with RA prevented cystathionine beta-synthase induction. A diabetic state also increased the activity of the folate-independent homocysteine remethylation enzyme betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, whereas the activity of the folate-dependent enzyme methionine synthase was diminished 52%. In contrast, RA treatment attenuated the streptozotocin-mediated increase in betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, whereas methionine synthase activity remained diminished. These results indicate that both a diabetic condition and RA treatment have marked effects on the metabolism of methyl groups and homocysteine, a finding that may have significant implications for diabetics and their potential sensitivity to retinoids.</p>

<p>To investigate the effect of stress on homocysteine metabolism in the rat and explore the mechanism as well as the key regulatory link of stress-induced hyperhomocysteinemia, male Wistar rats were treated with restraint stress while control rats received routine treatment. By HPLC-fluorometry, the homocysteine level in rat plasma was determined. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity in blood, heart, liver and kidney was measured by radioisotope assay using [(14)C]-serine as the labeled substrate. Total RNA was isolated from rat liver after restraint stress. RT-PCR and Northern blot were used to estimate the level of CBS mRNA. The results showed that hyperhomocysteinemia was induced by restraint stress. The highest CBS enzyme activity was seen in rat livers. A decrease in hepatic activities of CBS was found in restraint stress rats. The 29.4% +/-2.5% reduction in the activity of CBS was accompanied by a 44.1% +/-3.4% decrease in its mRNA level. CBS enzyme activity was slightly elevated in the kidney of stressed rats while it was almost undeterminable in the cardiovascular system. The study suggests that stress leads to an inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway in homocysteine metabolism. The hepatic CBS influenced by stress at the level of transcription exerts a profound effect on the circulating levels of homocysteine. The liver is the key organ where stress affects homocysteine metabolism.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a thyol amino acid resulting from a methylation of methionine, an essential amino acid derived from dietary proteins. Homocysteine is metabolized through two pathways: remethylation and transsulfuration, which use as confactors folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. The genetic and acquired factors that induce a reduction of levels of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 cause an increase of plasma levels of homocysteine. Numerous clinical studies showed a relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia, cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer disease. The hyperhomocysteinemia is also demonstrated in patients with Parkinson disease treated with levodopa and in the epileptic patients treated with anticonvulsant drugs. Nevertheless, so far it is not fully clear how significant is the relationship between the hyperhomocysteinemia and the above-mentioned neurological diseases.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Methionine metabolic impairment and selenium deficit have been associated to neural tube defects. The relationship between thiol metabolism and selenium is not well known. We assessed the status of aminothiols and selenium, as well as thiolic status and the amino acids involved in arginine synthesis in the case of selenium depletion and repletion, studying their relationship to neural tube defects.METHODS: We studied 44 women of 37 +/- 8 years (mean +/- SD) who had conceived fetuses with neural tube defects as cases; and 181 women of 39 +/- 7 years (mean +/- SD) with healthy children as controls. We determined selenium, vitamin B12, serum folates, plasma thiol compounds and amino acids. Homocysteine transsulfuration was assessed using total cysteine/total homocysteine ratio (tCys/tHcy), and selenium repletion cut-off value was 1.06 micromol/l (84 microg/l).RESULTS: Cases showed significantly lower levels (median) than controls of total homocysteine (P = 0.001), total cysteinylglycine (P &lt; 0.001), selenium (P &lt; 0.001) and tryptophane (P = 0.002); and higher tCys/tHcy levels (P &lt; 0.001), glutathione (P = 0.008) and L-arginine (P = 0.001). Cases with selenium depletion (selenium &lt; or = 1.06 micromol/l) had significantly higher levels than controls of cysteine (P = 0.010), glutathione (P = 0.005), tCys/tHcy (P &lt; 0.001), and arginine (P = 0.004), but significantly lower levels than controls of tryptophane (P = 0.027), cysteinylglycine (P &lt; 0.001) and folates (P &lt; 0.001). Only cysteinylglycine was lower than controls (P &lt; 0.001) when selenium &gt; 1.06 micromol/l. Methionine levels were higher in cases with selenium depletion than in repletion (P = 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, a diet deficient in selenium and folates or their absorption impairment, and/or other mechanisms related to polyamines and nitric oxide can lead to oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and to a higher occurrence of these malformations.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and occurs frequently in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate one-carbon flux rates of methionine and homocysteine (Hcy) in ESRD patients and healthy controls. Transmethylation (TM), remethylation (RM), and transsulfuration (TS), as well as Hcy clearance by TS (i.e., TS/plasma total Hcy concentration) and by RM (i.e., RM/plasma total Hcy concentration) were evaluated in relation to body composition, vitamins, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) levels. After a fixed protein diet for 3 days, primed-continuous infusion of [(2)H(3)-methyl-1-(13)C]methionine was performed in the postabsorptive state in 12 hemodialysis patients and 16 healthy volunteers. Hcy clearance by TS (-80%, P &lt; 0.001) and by RM (-77%, P &lt; 0.001) in ESRD patients was decreased compared with healthy controls. The absolute flux rates of TM (-27%, P &lt; 0.01) and RM (-28%, P = 0.02) were lower in the ESRD patients. After adjustment for age, TS was not significantly reduced. Whole blood AdoHcy was significantly elevated in ESRD and was a significant determinant of TM (standardized beta = -1.24, P = 0.01) and RM (standardized beta = -1.43, P = 0.03). In conclusion, patients with ESRD have impaired Hcy clearance by TS and RM. Elevated whole blood AdoHcy levels are associated with impaired RM and TM flux rates in these patients, and AdoHcy may be a key regulatory compound in one-carbon flux.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease. To understand the factors that determine the plasma homocysteine level it is necessary to appreciate the processes that produce homocysteine and those that remove it. Homocysteine is produced as a result of methylation reactions. Of the many methyltransferases, two are, normally, of the greatest quantitative importance. These are guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (that produces creatine) and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (that produces phosphatidylcholine). In addition, methylation of DOPA in patients with Parkinson’s disease leads to increased homocysteine production. Homocysteine is removed either by its irreversible conversion to cysteine (transsulfuration) or by remethylation to methionine. There are two separate remethylation reactions, catalyzed by betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase and methionine synthase, respectively. The reactions that remove homocysteine are very sensitive to B vitamin status as both the transsulfuration enzymes contain pyridoxal phosphate, while methionine synthase contains cobalamin and receives its methyl group from the folic acid one-carbon pool. There are also important genetic influences on homocysteine metabolism.</p>

<p>Tissue concentrations of both homocysteine (Hcy) and cysteine (Cys) are maintained at low levels by regulated production and efficient removal of these thiols. The regulation of the metabolism of methionine and Cys is discussed from the standpoint of maintaining low levels of Hcy and Cys while, at the same time, ensuring an adequate supply of these thiols for their essential functions. S-Adenosylmethionine coordinately regulates the flux through remethylation and transsulfuration, and glycine N-methyltransferase regulates flux through transmethylation and hence the S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio. Cystathionine beta-synthase activity is also regulated in response to the redox environment, and transcription of the gene is hormonally regulated in response to fuel supply (insulin, glucagon, and glucocorticoids). The H2S-producing capacity of cystathionine gamma-lyase may be regulated in response to nitric oxide. Cys is substrate for a variety of anabolic and catabolic enzymes. Its concentration is regulated primarily by hepatic Cys dioxygenase; the level of Cys dioxygenase is upregulated in a Cys-responsive manner via a decrease in the rate of polyubiquitination and, hence, degradation by the 26S proteasome.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing amino acid produced when methionine is demethylated. The majority of Hcy undergoes transsulfuration to cysteine by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), of which vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is an essential cofactor. The remainder of Hcy is remethylated by methionine synthase (MS), of which vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is an essential cofactor along with methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF). MTHF is generated by the enzyme MTHFR-reductase (MTHFR). High levels of Hcy can result from a variety of aquired factors (deficiency of vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid, high meat diet, smoking and others) or genetic (abnormalities of methionine–homocysteine metabolism). Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and venous thromboembolism; so called “cholesterol of XXI. age”. Results of many studies suggest that hyperhomocysteinemia, homozygous state for MTHFR gene mutation, folate deficiency are probably risk factors for recurrent fetal loss, intrauterine fetal death, thrombo-embolic disease in pregnancy, neural tube defects and congenital cardiac malformation at infants and other placental diseases (pre-eclampsia, placental abruption and intrauterine growth restriction IUGR). Those irregularities are very interesting and important for obstetricians and gynecologists. The plasma homocysteine values can be modulated by vitamins, vitamin B6 and folic acid in particular. The potential for research and possible prevention in this area is immense.</p>

<p>Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) is required for transsulfuration of homocysteine, an amino acid implicated in vascular disease. We studied homocysteine metabolism in mice with mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to a heterozygous disruption of the Cbs gene. Mice were fed diets supplemented with betaine or dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA); betaine and DMSA provide methyl groups for an alternate pathway of homocysteine metabolism, remethylation by betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). On control diets, heterozygous mice had 50% higher plasma homocysteine than did wild-type mice. Betaine and DMSA had similar effects in both genotype groups: liver betaine increased dramatically, while plasma homocysteine decreased by 40% to 50%. With increasing betaine supplementation, homocysteine decreased by 75%. Plasma homocysteine and BHMT activity both showed a strong negative correlation with liver betaine. Homocysteinemia in mice is sensitive to a disruption of Cbs and to methyl donor intake. Because betaine leads to a greater flux through BHMT and lowers homocysteine, betaine supplementation may be beneficial in mild hyperhomocysteinemia.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, neural tube defects, and Alzheimer’s disease. The transsulfuration pathway converts homocysteine to cysteine, and approximately 50% of the cysteine in glutathione is derived from homocysteine in human liver cells, which suggests the hypothesis that defects in the transsulfuration pathway perturb redox homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we examined a murine model for hyperhomocysteinemia in which the gene encoding the first enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), has been disrupted. Limited metabolite profiling and CBS expression studies in liver, kidney, and brain reveal tissue-specific differences in the response to Cbs disruption. Homozygous disruption of Cbs lowered cysteine concentration in all three organs. Glutathione concentration was diminished in liver and brain, thus affecting the redox buffering capacity in these organs, whereas the approximately twofold higher glutathione synthesis capacity in kidney helped preserve the glutathione pool size despite loss of the transsulfuration pathway in this organ. In contrast, disruption of a single Cbs allele elicited only minor redox perturbations. Furthermore, the Cbs+/- genotype did not confer a significant disadvantage compared with the Cbs+/+ genotype in hepatocytes challenged by oxidative stress from exposure to tertiary butylhydroperoxide. These studies provide evidence that homozygous disruption of Cbs perturbs redox homeostasis and reduces cysteine levels, raising the possibility that these changes may be important in the etiology of the clinical manifestations of CBS deficiency.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia is often associated with an increase in blood pressure. However our previous study has shown that methionine supplementation induced an increase in blood pressure in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and a decrease in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with significant differences in plasma homocysteine (Hcy) metabolites levels. Previously liver antioxidant status has been shown to be decreased in SHR compared to WKY rats. It has been suggested that oxidative stress may predispose to a decrease in NO bioavailability and induce the flux of Hcy through the liver transsulfuration pathway. Thus the aim of this study was 1) to investigate the effect of methionine supplementation on NO-derived metabolites in plasma and urine 2) to investigate whether abnormalities in Hcy metabolism may be responsible for the discrepancies observed between WKY rats and SHR concerning blood pressure and 3) to investigate whether a methionine-enriched diet, differently modified plasma and liver antioxidant status in WKY rats an SHR. We conclude that the increase in blood pressure in WKY rats is related to high plasma cysteine levels and is not due to a decrease in NO bioavailability and that the decrease in blood pressure in SHR is associated with high plasma GSH levels after methionine supplementation. So GSH synthesis appears to be stimulated by liver oxidative stress and GSH is redistributed into blood in SHR. So the great GSH synthesis can be rationalized as an autocorrective response that leads to a decreased blood pressure in SHR.</p>

Cellular cystathionine, cysteine, and methionine levels were increased after CSE exposure for 48h. Sub-acute exposure to CSE induced increases in cellular SAM and SAM/SAH ratio.

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non-protein forming amino-acid, whose metabolism is at the intersection of two metabolic pathways: remethylation and transsulfuration which are dependent on the vitamins folic acid, B(12) and B(6), and the enzymes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cystathionine-ß-synthetase. A deficiency of any of these vitamins or enzymes results in hyperhomocysteinemia. This causes oxidative and other damage to blood vessels, thus affecting various organ systems of the body. As part of our ongoing research on cardiovascular risk factors, we have studied the Hcy levels in the plasma of normal controls and those suffering from vascular diseases. It was observed that Hcy is significantly higher in patients of vascular diseases (21.59±1.28 µmol/L, mean±SEM), as compared to normal controls (11.33±0.18 µmol/L). This significance, was more pronounced in cases of venous thrombosis (26.77±2.43 µmol/L) as opposed to cases of arterial block (17.27±0.84 µmol/L). This signifies that Hcy estimation would be beneficial in obtaining a differential diagnosis in addition to being a modifiable vascular risk factor.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia is seen in most hemodialysis (HD) patients and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Homocysteine metabolism via remethylation requires activated folate and vitamin B12 and metabolism via transsulfuration requires serine and vitamin B6. Prior studies have shown highly variable effects of supplemental B vitamin and folate therapy for hyperhomocysteinemia. We undertook a fully controlled trial with abnormally high doses of folic acid alone or with supplemental vitamin B6 and B12 compared with active folate alone or with serine.METHODS: Two prospective studies were undertaken in hemodialysis patients. In the first study (protocol A), hyperhomocysteinemia was treated in 77 patients with 30 or 60 mg folic acid with or without vitamins B6 and B12 for eight weeks and compared with matching placebos. In the second study (protocol B), hyperhomocysteinemia was treated in 37 patients with intravenous folinic acid given alone or with serine and compared with matching placebos. All patients received the standard of care treatment with a multivitamin tablet before and throughout the protocol to test the hypothesis that additional therapy is required over and above the routine therapy for maximum reduction in total homocysteine (tHcy).RESULTS: Normal volunteers; The mean (SD) tHcy of 128 normal subjects was 6.5 (4) micromol/L. Protocol A; Plasma folate increased significantly in the groups given folic acid at both four and eight weeks (P = 0.0001 at both time points). Plasma vitamin B12 was significantly increased at four weeks (P = 0.0018) but not at eight weeks (P = 0.064) in those given Vitamin B12. However, tHcy did not differ between treatment groups at baseline (P = 0.63), four weeks (P = 0.79) or eight weeks (P = 0.74). Protocol B: Plasma folate increased significantly at four weeks in those receiving folinic acid (P = 0.0001) but tHcy was not significantly different between groups (P = 0.92). In neither study was there any significant change in tHcy comparing before and during any treatment intervention.CONCLUSIONS: In our studies high dose oral folic acid, intravenous folinic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 and oral serine were ineffective at lowering tHcy in patients on hemodialysis when given folic acid, folinic acid serine or B vitamins in addition to routine folic acid and B vitamin supplements.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine and occupies a crucial regulatory position between the methionine cycle and transsulfuration. The human cystathionine beta-synthase gene promoters -1a and -1b are expressed in a limited number of tissues and are coordinately regulated with proliferation through a redox-sensitive mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis, DNase I footprinting and deletion analysis of 5276 bp of 5’ proximal -1b flanking sequence revealed that this region does not confer tissue-specific expression and that 210 bp of proximal sequence is sufficient for maximal promoter activity. As little as 32 bp of the -1b proximal promoter region is capable of driving transcription in HepG2 cells, and this activity is entirely dependent upon the presence of a single overlapping Sp1/Egr1 binding site. Co-transfection studies in Drosophila SL2 cells indicated that both promoters are transactivated by Sp1 and Sp3 but only the -1b promoter is subject to a site-specific synergistic regulatory interaction between Sp1 and Sp3. Sp1-deficient fibroblasts expressing both Sp3 and NF-Y were negative for CBS activity. Transfection of these cells with a mammalian Sp1 expression construct induced high levels of CBS activity indicating that Sp1 has a critical and indispensable role in the regulation of cystathionine beta-synthase. Sp1 binding to both CBS promoters is sensitive to proliferation status and is negatively regulated by Kruppel-like factors in co-transfection experiments suggesting a possible mechanism for the tissue specific regulation of cystathionine beta-synthase.</p>

<p>Methionine is the precursor of homocysteine, a sulfur amino acid intermediate in the methylation and transsulfuration pathways. Elevated plasma homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) is associated with occlusive vascular disease. Whether homocysteine per se or a coincident metabolic abnormality causes vascular disease is still an open question. Animals with genetic hyperhomocysteinemia have so far not displayed atheromatous lesions. However, when methionine-rich diets are used to induce hyperhomocysteinemia, vascular pathology is often observed. Such studies have not distinguished the effects of excess dietary methionine from those of hyperhomocysteinemia. We fed apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with experimental diets designed to achieve three conditions: (i) high methionine intake with normal blood homocysteine; (ii) high methionine intake with B vitamin deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia; and (iii) normal methionine intake with B vitamin deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia. Mice fed methionine-rich diets had significant atheromatous pathology in the aortic arch even with normal plasma homocysteine levels, whereas mice fed B vitamin-deficient diets developed severe hyperhomocysteinemia without any increase in vascular pathology. Our findings suggest that moderate increases in methionine intake are atherogenic in susceptible mice. Although homocysteine may contribute to the effect of methionine, high plasma homocysteine was not independently atherogenic in this model. Some product of excess methionine metabolism rather than high plasma homocysteine per se may underlie the association of homocysteine with vascular disease.</p>

<p>The pathway for the biosynthesis of cysteine and homocysteine in Methanococcus jannaschii has been examined using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) stable isotope dilution method to identify and quantitate the intermediates in the pathways. The first step in the pathway, and the one responsible for incorporation of sulfur into both cysteine and methionine, is the reaction between O-phosphohomoserine and a presently unidentified sulfur source present in cell extracts, to produce L-homocysteine. This sulfur source was shown not to be sulfide. The resulting L-homocysteine then reacts with O-phosphoserine to form L-cystathionine, which is cleaved to L-cysteine. The pathway has elements of both the plant and mammalian pathways in that the sulfur is first incorporated into homocysteine using O-phosphohomoserine as the acceptor and the resulting homocysteine, via transsulfuration, supplies the sulfur for cysteine formation. The pathway leading to these two amino acids represents an example of metabolic thrift where the preexisting cellular metabolites O-phosphohomoserine and O-phosphoserine are used as the ultimate source of the carbon framework for the biosynthesis of these amino acids. These findings explain the absence of identifiable genes in the genome of this organism for the biosynthesis of cysteine and homocysteine.</p>

<p>Little is known about homocysteine metabolism in intestine. To address this question, we investigated homocysteine metabolism under conditions of folate adequacy and folate deprivation in the Caco-2 cell line, a model of human intestinal mucosal cells. Caco-2 cells were cultured in media enriched with [3-(13)C]serine and [U-(13)C(5)]methionine tracers, and enrichments of intracellular free amino acid pools of these amino acids as well as homocysteine, cystathionine, and cysteine were measured by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Homocysteine transsulfuration plus folate-dependent and total remethylation were quantified from these amino acid enrichments. Homocysteine remethylation accounted for 19% of the intracellular free methionine pool in cells cultured with supplemental folate, and nearly all one-carbon units used for remethylation originated from the three carbon of serine via folate-dependent remethylation. Labeling of cystathionine and cysteine indicated the presence of a complete transsulfuration pathway in Caco-2 cells, and this pathway produced 13% of the intracellular free cysteine pool. Appearance of labeled homocysteine and cystathionine in culture medium suggests export of these metabolites from intestinal cells. Remethylation was reduced by one-third in folate-restricted cell cultures (P &lt; 0.001), and only approximately 50% of the one-carbon units used for remethylation originated from the three carbon of serine under these conditions. In conclusion, the three carbon of serine is the primary source of one-carbon units used for homocysteine remethylation in folate-supplemented Caco-2 cell cultures. Remethylation is reduced as a result of folate restriction in this mucosal cell model, and one-carbon sources other than the three carbon of serine contribute to remethylation under this condition.</AbstractText>: Little is known about homocysteine metabolism in intestine.

<p>Perturbation of folate and methyl group metabolism is associated with a number of pathological conditions, including cardiovascular disease and neoplastic development. Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a key protein that functions to regulate the supply and utilization of methyl groups for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent transmethylation reactions. Factors or conditions that have the ability to regulate GNMT and the generation of homocysteine, a product of transmethylation, have important implications in the potential perturbation of methyl group metabolism. We showed that retinoid compounds induce active hepatic GNMT, resulting in compromised transmethylation processes. Because retinoids can stimulate gluconeogenesis, a condition known to alter methyl group and homocysteine metabolism, the current study was undertaken to determine the relationship between all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and gluconeogenic hormones on these metabolic pathways. Intact adrenal function was not required for RA to induce and activate hepatic GNMT; however, treatment of rats with dexamethasone (DEX) was as effective as RA in inducing GNMT in rat liver. The marked increase in plasma total homocysteine levels observed in adrenalectomized rats was reduced to normal levels by treatment with either RA or DEX, indicating that the transsulfuration and/or remethylation pathways may be enhanced. Moreover, coadministration of RA and DEX had an additive effect on GNMT induction. Similar findings were also observed in a rat hepatoma cell culture model using H4IIE cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that both RA and DEX independently induce GNMT, thereby having substantial implications for the potential interaction of retinoid administration with diabetes.</p>

<p>Cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes a gamma-replacement reaction, in which the succinyl group of an O-succinyl-L-homoserine (L-OSHS) is displaced by the thiol of L-cysteine to form L-cystathionine, in the first step of the bacterial transsulfuration pathway. The mechanism of Escherichia coli CGS (eCGS) is ordered with L-OSHS associating before L-Cys (k(catR)/K(mR)(L-OSHS) = 9.8 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), where the subscript R denotes the replacement reaction). The mechanism becomes ping-pong (k(catR)/K(mR)(L-OSHS) = 4.9 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) at L-Cys concentrations lower than K(m)(L-Cys). The enzyme also catalyzes a competing gamma-elimination reaction, in which L-OSHS is hydrolyzed to succinate, NH(3), and alpha-ketobutyrate (k(catE)/K(mE)(L-OSHS) = 1350 +/- 90 M(-1) s(-1), where the subscript E denotes the elimination reaction). The k(cat)/K(m)(L-OSHS) versus pH profile of eCGS is bell-shaped for both reactions. The pH optimum and the pK(a) values for the acidic and basic limbs are 7.4, 6.8 +/- 0.1, and 8.0 +/- 0.1, respectively, for the elimination reaction and 7.8, 7.4 +/- 0.1, and 8.3 +/- 0.1, respectively, for the replacement reaction. The internal aldimine of eCGS remains protonated at pH &lt;10.5, and the alpha-amino group of L-OSHS has a pK(a) of 9.71 +/- 0.01; therefore, neither limb of the k(cat)/K(m)(L-OSHS) versus pH profiles can be assigned to aldimine, or to L-OSHS prototropy. Novel continuous assays for the elimination reaction, employing D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase, and for the substitution reaction, employing cystathionine beta-lyase and L-lactate dehydrogenase as coupling enzymes, are described.</p>

<p>There are two major pathways for methionine biosynthesis: the enterobacterial type transsulfuration pathway and the sulfhydrylation pathway as previously identified in the spirochete Leptospira meyeri. Sequence analysis of the L. meyeri metYX locus allows the identification of a third gene, called metW, which encodes a protein exhibiting similarities with homologs in many organisms belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subdivisions of proteobacteria. The metW, metX and metY genes of L. meyeri were disrupted by a resistance cassette by homologous recombination. While the L. meyeri metX mutant shows methionine auxotrophy, the metY mutant (as well as the metW and metYmetW mutants) conserves methionine prototrophy, suggesting the presence of additional route(s) which may bypass the direct sulfhydrylation pathway. In addition, a L. interrogans gene, called metZ, was found to complement an Escherichia coli metB mutant, further suggesting that the transsulfuration pathway is also present in Leptospira spp.</p>

<p>Alterations in the hepatic metabolism of S-amino acids were examined in male rats injected with a single dose of ethanol (3 g/kg, i.p.). The hepatic concentrations of methionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were increased, but S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), cysteine, and glutathione (GSH) decreased rapidly following ethanol administration. The activities of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), cystathionine beta-synthase (CbetaS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CgammaL) were all inhibited. Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) activity was increased from t = 8 hr, but hepatic glutathione (GSH) level did not return to control for 48 hr. Both hepatic hypotaurine and taurine levels were increased immediately, which were reduced to below control from t = 18 hr. Changes in the serum concentration of taurine were consistent with results observed in the liver. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) activity was increased rapidly, but declined from t = 24 hr. The results indicate that an acute dose of ethanol induces significant alterations in the metabolism of S-amino acids in the liver. Ethanol depresses the cysteine availability for GSH synthesis not only by inhibiting the transsulfuration reactions but also by enhancing its irreversible catabolism to taurine via hypotaurine. The physiological significance of this finding is discussed.</p>

<p>It is unresolved whether elevated homocysteine in coronary artery disease (CAD) is the cause of arteriosclerosis or its consequence. In contrast, genetic variants of enzymes that metabolize homocysteine cannot be altered by arteriosclerosis. Consequently, their association with CAD would permit to imply causality. We modeled by regression analysis the effect of 11 variants in the methionine cycle upon CAD manifestation in 591 controls and 278 CAD patients. Among the examined variants only the carriership for the c.844ins68 in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene was associated with a significantly lowered risk of CAD (OR=0.56; 95% CI=0.35-0.90 in the univariable, and OR=0.41, 95% CI=0.19-0.89 for obese people in the multivariable analysis, respectively). Healthy carriers of the c.844ins68 variant exhibited, compared to the wild type controls, significantly higher postload ratios of blood S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine (61.4 vs. 54.9, p=0.001) and of plasma total cysteine to homocysteine (8.6 vs. 7.3, p=0.004). The changes in these metabolites are compatible with an improved methylation status and with enhanced activity of homocysteine transsulfuration. In conclusion, the coincidence of clinical and biochemical effects of a common c.844ins68 CBS variant supports the hypothesis that compounds relating to homocysteine metabolism may play role in the development and/or progression of CAD.</p>

<p>There are two alternative pathways leading to methionine synthesis in microorganisms: The transsulfuration pathway involves cystathionine as the intermediate and utilizes cysteine as the sulfur source, but the direct sulfhydrylation pathway bypasses cystathionine and uses inorganic sulfur instead. While most microorganisms synthesize methionine via either one of these pathways, Corynebacterium glutamicum utilizes both pathways, which appear to be fully functional. In C. glutamicum, each pathway is catalyzed by independent enzymes and is tightly regulated by methionine. Although the physiological significance of parallel pathways remains to be elucidated, their presence suggests metabolic flexibility and efficient adaptation of the organism to its environment.</p>

<p>To gain insight into the evolution of the methionine biosynthesis pathway, in vivo complementation tests were performed. The substrate specificity of three enzymes that intrinsically use different homoserine-esterified substrates and have different sulfur assimilation pathways was examined: two cystathionine gamma-synthases (the Escherichia coli enzyme that naturally utilizes O-succinylhomoserine [OSH]) and the Arabidopsis thaliana enzyme that naturally exploits O-phosphohomoserine [OPH]. Both of these act through the transsulfuration pathway. The third enzyme investigated was O-acetylhomoserine (OAH) sulfhydrylase of Leptospira meyeri, representing the enzyme that utilizes OAH and operates through the direct sulfhydrylation pathway. All the three enzymes were able to utilize OSH and OAH as substrates, with different degrees of efficiency, but only the plant enzyme was able to utilize OPH as a substrate. In addition to their inherent activity in the transsulfuration pathway, the two cystathionine gamma-synthases were also capable of acting in the direct sulfhydrylation pathway. Based on the phylogenic tree and the results of the complementation tests, we suggest that the ancestral gene was able to act as OAH or OSH sulfhydrylase. In some bacteria and plants, this ancient enzyme most probably evolved into a cystathionine gamma-synthase, thereby maintaining the ability to utilize various homoserine-esterified substrates, as well as various sulfur sources, and thus keeping the multisubstrate specificity of its ancestor. In some organisms, this ancestral gene probably underwent a duplication event, which resulted in a cystathionine gamma-synthase and a separate OAH or OSH sulfhydrylase. This led to the development of two parallel pathways of methionine biosynthesis, transsulfuration and direct sulfhydrylation, in these organisms. Although both pathways exist in several organisms, most seem to favor a single specific pathway for methionine biosynthesis in vivo.</p>

<p>Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk of vascular disease. Homocysteine is a sulphur-containing amino acid whose metabolism stands at the intersection of two pathways: remethylation to methionine, which requires folate and vitamin B12 (or betaine in an alternative reaction); and transsulfuration to cystathionine which requires vitamin B6. The two pathways are coordinated by S-adenosylmethionine which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and as an activator of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Hyperhomocysteinemia arises from disrupted homocysteine metabolism. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia is due to rare genetic defects resulting in deficiencies in CBS, MTHFR, or in enzymes involved in methyl cobalamine synthesis and homocysteine methylation. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia seen in fasting condition is due to mild impairment in the methylation pathway (i.e. folate or B12 deficiencies or MTHFR thermolability). Post-methionine-load hyperhomocysteinaemia may be due to heterozygous cystathionine-beta-synthase defect or B6 deficiency. Patients with homocystinuria and severe hyperhomocysteinemia develop arterial thrombotic events, venous thromboembolism, and more seldom premature arteriosclerosis. Experimental evidence suggests that an increased concentration of homocysteine may result in vascular changes through several mechanisms. High levels of homocysteine induce sustained injury of arterial endothelial cells, proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells and enhance expression/activity of key participants in vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, and vulnerability of the established atherosclerotic plaque. These effects are supposed to be mediated through its oxidation and the concomitant production of reactive oxygen species. Other effects of homocysteine include: impaired generation and decreased bioavailability of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide; interference with many transcription factors and signal transduction; oxidation of low-density lipoproteins; lowering of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. In fact, the effect of elevated homocysteine appears multifactorial affecting both the vascular wall structure and the blood coagulation system.</p>

<p>In mammals, cystathionine beta-synthase catalyzes the first step in the transsulfuration pathway which provides an avenue for the conversion of the essential amino acid, methionine, to cysteine. Cystathionine beta-synthase catalyzes a PLP-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine and is unique in also having a heme cofactor. In this review, recent advances in our understanding of the kinetic mechanism of the yeast and human enzymes as well as pathogenic mutants of the human enzyme and insights into the role of heme in redox sensing are discussed from the perspective of the crystal structure of the catalytic core of the human enzyme.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a non-protein forming sulfur amino acid, synthesised from methionine (Met), whose metabolism is at the junction of two metabolic pathways: remethylation and transsulfuration. Increased Hcy serum concentration is a well established independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases and a known feature of end stage renal disease. Hcy plasma level is influenced by folate, vitamin B6 and genetic factors. Mutation C677T in gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme involved in Hcy remethylation has been associated with elevated Hcy in homozygous carriers (TT genotype). Several amino acids take part in metabolism of Hcy. There are abnormalities of concentration of the non essential and essential of amino acids in serum of patients treated with hemodialysis (HD). It is possible that these abnormalities of amino acids can change the Hcy metabolism. The aim of this study was the evaluation of some aspects of Hcy metabolism. We examined the MTHFR gene polymorphism and its relationship with plasma Hcy concentration. The plasma levels of total amino acids and amino acids connected with Hcy metabolism: methionine (Met), seryne (Ser), cysteine (Cyst) and tauryne (Tau) were evaluated in hemodialysis patients. The study was conducted in 71 (35 male, 36 female) patients, mean age 56.2 +/- 12.4 years. They were dialysed for a mean duration of 87.7 +/- 84.7 months (range 2-302). The control group (CG) in which Hcy and amino acids levels were examined consisted of 12 healthy subjects. Serum (EDTA) Hcy levels were measured by EIA-Hcy ELISA kit. The MTHFR gene polymorphism was evaluated by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amino acids were measured by chromatography in amino acid analyser AAA 400. Mean concentration of Hcy was significantly higher in patients than in CG (31.1 +/- 9.1 vs 11.9 +/- 2.9 mumol/L; p &lt; 0.01). Genotype frequencies in patients were: 42.8% for CC, 48.5% for CT and 8.7% for TT. Mean concentration of Hcy were similar in above genotype groups: 31.2 +/- 9.4; 30.7 +/- 10.7; 32.8 +/- 5.1 mumol/L, respectively. We did not find any correlation between Hcy level and the mutation in gene coding for MTHFR in our study group of patients. Mean total amino acid concentrations were significantly lower in plasma patients than in CG: 3624.48 +/- 140.32 vs 4454.45 +/- 774.91 mumol/L; p &lt; 0.05. Mean plasma level of Tau was significantly lower in patients than in CG: 93.01 +/- 43.73 vs 286.75 +/- 57.02 mumol/l; p &lt; 0.01. Also mean plasma level of Ser was significantly lower in patients than in CG; 125.71 +/- 24.25 vs 233.61 +/- 44.55 mumol/L; p &lt; 0.01. Mean concentration of Cys were significantly higher in hemodialysis patients than in CG: 100.82 +/- 43.53 vs 31.31 +/- 21.31 mumol/L; p &lt; 0.01. Mean Met concentrations were not significantly different between two studied groups. We found significant positive correlation between plasma Hcy levels and plasma Cys level (r = 0491; p &lt; 0.05). Also there was a significant positive correlation between plasma Hcy level and duration of hemodialysis (r = 5411; p &lt; 0.05). We concluded that in our studied population of hemodialysis patients there was no significant association between mutation in the gene coding for MTHFR and hyperhomocysteinemia and hypercysteinemia. There are abnormalities of plasma level of amino acids which are take part in Hcy metabolism in hemodialysis patients.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first of two steps in the transsulfuration pathway that converts homocysteine to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, a major intracellular antioxidant. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), which is known to enhance production of reactive oxygen species, increased CBS activity and glutathione levels in HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the higher CBS activity correlated with cleavage of the enzyme to a truncated form. This cleavage was suppressed by inhibitors of superoxide production or by transfection with an expression vector for manganese superoxide dismutase. The commonly used proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin but not N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, suppressed the TNFalpha-induced response. Targeted proteolysis of CBS was also observed in livers of mice injected with lipopolysaccharide, which is known to induce TNFalpha. Together, these data reveal a novel and previously unknown mechanism of regulation for homocysteine-linked glutathione homeostasis in cells challenged by oxidative stress.</p>

<p>We showed previously that 64% of the total dietary sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirement could be supported by dietary cysteine (Cys). However, the observation of such a sparing effect may be affected by the dietary intakes of SAA provided. The aim of this study was to compare methionine (Met) metabolism and transsulfuration (TS) in five healthy men fed three different diets (in random order) for 3 d each, with varying combinations of Met and Cys: 24 mg Met/(kg. d) and no Cys (diet A); 13 mg Met/(kg. d) and 11 mg Cys/(kg. d) (diet B); and 5 mg Met/(kg. d) and 19 mg Cys/(kg. d) (diet C). On d 3, Met kinetics and TS were assessed using orally administered L-[1-(13)C, methyl-(2)H(3)]methionine. Met demethylation (transmethylation, TM) significantly decreased as the dietary Met to Cys ratio decreased. Met TS was significantly lower during diets B [2.8 +/- 0.4 micro mol/(kg. h)] and C [1.5 +/- 0.5 micro mol/(kg. h)] than during diet A [7.8 +/- 2.9 micro mol/(kg. h)] (P &lt; 0.05). The results of the present study indicate that when the ratio of Met to Cys fed is typical of that found in major food proteins and total SAA are sufficient to meet requirements, TS is significantly reduced compared with the case in which SAA needs are supplied by Met alone. We conclude that Cys sparing occurs through an increase in the fraction of the homocysteine pool destined for RM relative to TS (RM:TS).</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia, caused by a lack of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), leads to elevated plasma concentrations of homocysteine. This is a common risk factor for atherosclerosis, stroke, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms that link hyperhomocysteinemia due to CBS deficiency to these diseases are still unknown. Early biochemical studies describe developmental and adult patterns of transsulfuration and CBS expression in a variety of species. However, there is incomplete knowledge about the regional and cellular expression pattern of CBS, notably in the brain. To complete the previous data, we used in situ hybridization and Northern blotting to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of Cbs gene expression during mouse development. In the early stages of development, the Cbs gene was expressed only in the liver and in the skeletal, cardiac, and nervous systems. The expression declined in the nervous system in the late embryonic stages, whereas it increased in the brain after birth, peaking during cerebellar development. In the adult brain, expression was strongest in the Purkinje cell layer and in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that the CBS protein was localized in most areas of the brain but predominantly in the cell bodies and neuronal processes of Purkinje cells and Ammon’s horn neurons.</p>

<p>S-Adenosyl-L-methionine(SAM) is an important metabolic intermediate in the metabolic flux of sulphur. SAM is involved in three key metabolic pathways: transmethylation, transsulfuration and polyamine synthesis. As a potential therapeutic agent, SAM is being used as over the counter drug and nutrient supplement. An expression vector, harboring SAM synthetase 2 gene from S. cerevisiae and regulated by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter P(GAP), was transformed into GS115 strain of P. pastoris. Through zeocin resistance and expression screening, a recombinant strain was obtained that had high SAM yield and the fermentation conditions were optimized. The results showed that carbon source, nitrogen source, pH and dissolved oxygen had significant effects on the accumulation of SAM. The SAM production of the recombinant cells reached 2.49 g/L after fermentation for three days under the optimized conditions. The present studies show that fermentation of recombinant P. pastoris strain, expressing heterologous SAM synthetase gene, may be a promising approach for the production of SAM.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinaemia is generally accepted as an independent and graded risk factor for both arterial occlusive disease and venous thrombosis. The only way of homocysteine degradation is conversion to cysteine in the transsulfuration pathway in which the regulating step is catalysed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Mild impairment of CBS function could therefore affect homocysteine concentration, in particular after methionine loading, and consequently cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We analysed two silent polymorphisms and one short tandem repeat in the CBS gene (ie 699C–&gt;T, 1080C–&gt;T and -5697 (GT) STR) as genetic markers potentially in linkage disequilibrium with a functional polymorphism. We assessed their association with fasting and post-methionine load homocysteine in 190 patients with arterial occlusive disease, and in 381 controls. No differences in CBS genotype frequencies between cases and controls were found, nor was a particular CBS genotype associated with an elevated risk of arterial occlusive disease. Although we did find a high rate of linkage disequilibrium between the two single nucleotide polymorphisms and the GT STR, none of the genotypes defined by the three CBS variants studied showed an association with elevated fasting, post-load or increase upon methionine loading homocysteine concentrations. In conclusion, we did not find any indication that genetic variation in the CBS gene is associated with increased homocysteine concentrations.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIM: It has been reported that plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) patients without renal involvement are higher, similar to or lower than those in healthy controls.METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured plasma Hcy in 60 controls, 79 type 1 diabetics (23 with retinopathy, 22 with nephropathy) and 73 non-diabetic relatives of 30 probands. The female controls had lower levels than their male counterparts: geometric mean 10.5 vs 13.6 mumol/L, p &lt; 0.001. Among the controls, smokers (n = 20) and ex-smokers (n = 12) had higher Hcy levels than non-smokers (n = 28): 13.2 and 13.2 vs 10.9 mumol/L, p &lt; 0.01. Among the diabetics, high plasma Hcy levels were associated with male gender: 11.9 vs 9.1 mumol/L in women, p &lt; 0.01. The patients without complications had higher plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (p &lt; 0.001), and lower plasma Hcy (9.2 mumol/L vs 12.2, p &lt; 0.01) and uric acid levels (p &lt; 0.05) than the controls. The patients with nephropathy and higher levels of Hcy (13.0 mumol/L vs 9.0, p &lt; 0.05), and different levels of creatinine (p &lt; 0.01), uric acid (p &lt; 0.01), fibrinogen (p &lt; 0.05), and urinary albumin (p &lt; 0.001) than those with retinopathy. There was no difference in Hcy levels between the patients’ relatives and the controls: 11.9 mumol/L in siblings vs 11.6 mumol/L, 13.5 mumol/L in parents vs 12.1 mumol/L. In the control group, plasma Hcy levels were associated with age, gender and smoking; among the diabetics, they correlated with age, gender, smoking, and plasma creatinine and lipoprotein (a) levels.CONCLUSIONS: 1) male gender and smoking are associated with high Hcy levels in healthy people; 2) plasma Hcy levels are lower in T1DM patients than in healthy people (glomerular hyperfiltration and accelerated hepatic transsulfuration?); 3) high Hcy levels are associated with diabetic nephropathy and plasma creatinine levels; and 4) non-diabetic first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetics have normal plasma Hcy concentrations.</p>

By supplementation with cysteine in PCM rats (PCMC group), cysteine level was elevated almost close to the control level, and glutathione (GSH), aspartic acid and serine levels were restored greater than the control levels. The measurement of transsulfuration enzyme activities exhibited that gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (gamma-GCL) activity was up-regulated in rats with protein restriction (PCM group), and cysteine supplementation (PCMC group) down-regulated to the control level. One-week supplementation of cysteine (PCMC group) significantly down-regulated the cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase activity. These results indicate that the availability of sulfur amino acid(s) especially cysteine appears to play a role in determining the flux of cysteine between cysteine catabolism and GSH synthesis.</p>

<p>S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), a metabolite present in all living cells, plays a central role in cellular biochemistry as a precursor to methylation, aminopropylation, and transsulfuration pathways. As such, SAMe has been studied extensively since its chemical structure was first described in 1952. Decades of research on the biochemical and molecular roles of SAMe in cellular metabolism have provided an extensive foundation for its use in clinical studies, including those on depression, dementia, vacuolar myelopathy, liver disease, and osteoarthritis. This article provides an overview of the biochemical, molecular, and therapeutic effects of this pleiotrophic molecule.</p>

<p>Disturbances of the methionine cycle may result in liver injury. Patients with alcohol-induced liver disease often exhibit hypermethioninemia and a delayed clearance (CL) of methionine, but the extent to which transsulfuration and remethylation pathways of the cyclic methionine metabolism are affected is unknown. Methionine turnover was determined in 7 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis after oral administration of 2 mg/kg [(2)H(3)-methyl-1-(13)C]methionine, which permitted us to follow transsulfuration by its decarboxylation to (13)CO(2) and remethylation by replacement of the labeled methyl group by an unlabeled one. Basal plasma concentrations of endogenous methionine (50 +/- 5 vs. 25 +/- 2 micromol/L, mean +/- SEM, P &lt;.001) were significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis and its CL was significantly decreased (774 +/- 103 vs. 2,050 +/- 141 mL/min, P &lt;.001). Methionine turnover amounted to 42 +/- 4 vs. 27 +/- 3 micromol/kg/h (P &lt;.05) in controls and patients with cirrhosis, respectively. The fraction of administered methionine undergoing remethylation was lower in patients with cirrhosis (7.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 14.1 +/- 1.1%, P &lt;.005). However, because of the larger pool of circulating methionine, the total flux of methionine through the remethylation pathway was similar in both groups. A significantly lower fraction of the administered dose appeared in the form of (13)CO(2) in breath in patients with cirrhosis (2.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.0 +/- 0.8%, P &lt;.001). In conclusion, the data indicate that the liver with cirrhosis compensates for a decreased activity of remethylating enzymes by operating at higher concentrations of methionine. In contrast, transsulfuration is impaired in patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis such that an assessment of transsulfuration by a simple breath test may provide a clinically useful estimate of hepatic function.</p>

This technique demonstrated impaired recycling as the major disturbance to explain hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with end-stage renal failure, and can be used to optimize interventions with folate, B6, and B12 supplementation in this patient group. Intravenous infusion of [2,3,3-(2)H3] serine has also been applied to demonstrate the appearance of [2H2]- as well as [2H1]-methionine in plasma and protein, suggesting transfer of a one-carbon group from serine via 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate in human hepatocyte cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. In sheep, tissue free methionine enrichments after infusion of universally labeled [U-13C] methionine showed the highest remethylation activity in postmortem investigation of jejunum, liver, and kidney tissue samples, but no such activity in muscle and brain samples. Methods to quantitate one-carbon acceptor metabolism pathways and folate metabolism have recently become available.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin B12, folate and vitamin B6 are the main determinants of homocysteinemia. These B-group vitamins influence two metabolic pathways of homocysteine reduction, which prevail in dependence to methionine intake. Transsulfuration (vitamin B6) dominates under condition of overnutrition with prevalence of animal food sources, remethylation (vitamin B12 and folic acid) is decisive under conditions of malnutrition, alternative nutrition or optimal traditional diet.METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma homocysteine and folic acid, vitamins B12 and B6 in serum were measured in alternative nutrition groups of adults (vegans, vegetarians (lacto + lactoovo), semivegetarians, n = 39) and compared with those values in group consuming traditional diet–control group, general population (n = 35). In alternative nutrition groups, the average homocysteine level is significantly higher (vegans 17.2 mumol/l, vegetarians 12.9 mumol/l, semivegetarians 10.1 mumol/l, control group 9.9 mumol/l); the frequency of hyperhomocysteinemia (over 15 mumol/l) is 50%, 32%, 14% vs. 6% in control group. Vegetarians and vegans have a significantly higher levels of vitamin B6 and folic acid; the frequency of vitamin B6 deficit is 60% and 57% in control group and semivegetarian group vs. 16% and 0% in vegetarian and vegan group. Folate deficit was found in 16% of traditional group vs. 0% in alternative groups. Serum levels of vitamin B12 are significantly reduced in subjects consuming alternative nutrition with deficiency observed in 67% of vegans, 32% of vegetarians, 14% of semivegetarians vs. 0% in control group.CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin levels in relation to nutritional regime and metabolic pathways of homocysteine show that the mild hyperhomocysteinemia in alternative nutrition is a consequence of vitamin B12 deficiency. In traditionally fed population, higher plasma homocysteine values is caused by folate deficiency. These conclusions are supported by a significantly negative linear correlation of homocysteine–folic acid levels (traditional nutrition) and homocysteine–vitamin B12 levels (alternative nutrition). In case of vitamin B6, a similar correlation was not found.</p>

<p>Holstein steers were used in two 5 x 5 Latin square experiments to evaluate the sparing of methionine by alternative sources of methyl groups (betaine and choline). Steers were housed in metabolism crates and limit-fed a soybean hull-based diet high in rumen degradable protein. To increase energy supply, ruminal infusions of volatile fatty acids and abomasal infusions of glucose were provided. An amino acid mixture, limiting in methionine, was infused abomasally to ensure that nonsulfur amino acids did not limit protein synthesis. Treatments for Exp. 1 were abomasal infusion of 1) water, 2) 2 g/d L-methionine, 3) 1.7 g/d L-cysteine, 4) 1.6 g/d betaine, and 5) 1.7 g/d L-cysteine + 1.6 g/d betaine. Treatments for Exp. 2 were abomasal infusion of 1) water, 2) 2 g/d L-methionine, 3) 8 g/d betaine, 4) 16 g/d betaine, and 5) 8 g/d choline. In both experiments, nitrogen retention increased in response to methionine (P &lt; 0.05), demonstrating a deficiency of sulfur amino acids. Responses to cysteine, betaine, and choline were all small and not significant. The lack of response to cysteine indicates that the response to methionine was not due to transsulfuration to cysteine or that cysteine supply did not alter the flux of methionine through transsulfuration. The lack of response to betaine suggests that the steers’ needs for methyl groups were met by the dietary conditions or that betaine was relatively inefficient in increasing the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and, thereby, reducing the synthesis of cysteine from homocysteine. Under our experimental conditions, responses to methionine were likely due to a correction of a deficiency of methionine per se rather than of methyl group donors.</p>

<p>High plasma homocysteine, a risk factor for atherosclerosis, is frequently caused by a common mutation in the gene for the enzyme, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), C677T (alanine to valine substitution) or low intake of B vitamins that affect the remethylation or transsulfuration pathways in homocysteine metabolism. However, the interaction of the C677T mutation and B vitamins other than folate has not been well elucidated. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 324 men and 641 women who participated in a 1996 health examination under a hypothesis that high nutritional status of folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 expressed as high serum levels, may compensate for the hyperhomocysteinemia associated with homozygosity for the C677T mutation, but not for having the mutation per se. Age-adjusted plasma homocysteine levels were higher for both men and women with the homozygous genotype for the mutation than those who were heterozygous or had no mutation. Elevated homocysteine levels in homozygous genotype was attenuated among persons with higher serum levels of vitamin B12 and folate, but not vitamin B6, and among persons with the combination of lower folate and higher vitamin B12 and of higher folate and higher vitamin B12, split by the median. These findings suggest that elevated homocysteine levels among Japanese with the homozygous genotype for the MTHFR gene mutation can be modified efficiently by dietary supplement of vitamin B12 as well as folate.</p>

<p>Homocysteine metabolism is altered in diabetic patients. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme involved in the transsulfuration pathway, which irreversibly converts homocysteine to cysteine, catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine. Studies in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats have shown that CBS enzyme activity is elevated in the liver but not in the kidney, and this effect is reversed by insulin treatment. To determine whether these effects resulted from alterations at the level of gene transcription, CBS mRNA was measured in diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic rats. CBS mRNA levels were found to be markedly higher in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat livers; these were reduced by insulin administration. In H4IIE cells, a rat hepatoma cell culture model, glucocorticoids increased the cellular levels of CBS enzyme protein and CBS mRNA; insulin inhibited this stimulatory effect. Treatment with insulin also decreased CBS levels in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. Nuclear run-on experiments in the rat cells confirmed that stimulation of CBS gene expression by glucocorticoids and the inhibition by insulin occurred at the transcriptional level. Transient transfections of HepG2 cells with a CBS-1b promoter luciferase reporter construct showed that the promoter activity was decreased by 70% after insulin treatment. These results show that insulin has a direct role in regulating homocysteine metabolism. Altered insulin levels in diseases such as diabetes may influence homocysteine metabolism by regulating the hepatic transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>Methionine catabolism occurs mostly in the liver through the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in a reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). S-adenosylmethionine is the principal biologic methyl donor, a precursor for polyamines, and in liver, it is also a precursor for reduced glutathione (GSH). Liver-specific and non-liver-specific MAT are products of two different genes, MAT1A and MAT2A, respectively. Mature liver expresses MAT1A, whereas MAT2A is expressed in extrahepatic tissues and induced during liver growth and de-differentiation. The type of MAT expressed by the cell affects the steady-state SAM level, DNA methylation, and growth rate. This has been demonstrated further by using the MAT1A knockout mouse model in which hepatic SAM and GSH levels decrease, the liver becomes larger and more susceptible to injury, and steatohepatitis develops spontaneously. Altered methionine metabolism in alcoholic liver disease results in decreased transmethylation and transsulfuration, changes that may play important pathogenic roles. Major changes include a relative switch in MAT expression; decreased hepatic SAM, GSH, and DNA methylation levels; decreased homocysteine metabolism; and hyperhomocysteinemia. Consequences of hepatic DNA hypomethylation include increased expression of c-myc and DNA strand break accumulation. One possible consequence of hyperhomocysteinemia is increased fibrogenesis. Abnormal methionine metabolism may also occur in Kupffer cells, which express both forms of MAT. If SAM levels also decrease in these cells, this may contribute to the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression and release. In summary, altered hepatic methionine metabolism can have serious consequences that affect not only hepatocytes, but also hepatic stellate and Kupffer cells. These changes can lead to impaired antioxidant defense, altered gene expression, promotion of fibrogenesis, and even hepatocarcinogenesis.</p>

<p>Alcohol has complex direct effects on homocysteine metabolism, which are incompletely understood, and indirect effects mediated by interactions with vitamin metabolism and other factors. Both transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways are affected. Alcohol abuse is a common cause of hyperhomocysteinemia that often fluctuates and is sometimes severe. The causative role of alcohol in hyperhomocysteinemia is often overlooked by clinicians when evaluating patients and by investigators when conducting surveys. A married couple with severe hyperhomocysteinemia owing to surreptitious alcohol abuse, a case study illustrating many of these issues, is presented. A steep rise in S-adenosylhomocysteine as well as homocysteine levels was demonstrated with increased alcohol ingestion, with a decreased S-adenosylmethionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio. Both patients had severe neurologic symptoms as well as macrocytic red blood cells, which, along with the high homocysteine levels, were misattributed to cobalamin deficiency, in one case despite serum cobalamin levels that were normal.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine and occupies a crucial regulatory position between the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of cysteine by transsulfuration. Analysis of CBS activity under a variety of growth conditions indicated that CBS is coordinately regulated with proliferation in both yeast and human cells. In batch cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, maximal CBS activities were observed in the exponential phase of cells grown on glucose, while growth-arrested cultures or those growing non-fermentatively on ethanol or glycerol had approximately 3-fold less activity. CBS activity assays and Western blotting indicated that growth-specific regulation of CBS is evolutionarily conserved in a range of human cell lines. CBS activity was found to be maximal during proliferation and was reduced two- to five-fold when cells became quiescent at confluence. In cultured HepG2 cells, the human CBS gene is induced by serum and basic fibroblast growth factor and is downregulated, but not abolished, by contact inhibition, serum-starvation, nutrient depletion, or the induction of differentiation. Consequently, for certain cell types, CBS may represent a novel marker of both differentiation and proliferation. The intracellular level of the CBS regulator compound, S-adenosylmethionine, was found to reflect the proliferation status of both yeast and human cells, and as such, constitutes an additional mechanism for proliferation-specific regulation of human CBS. Our data indicates that screening compounds for the ability to affect transsulfuration in cultured cell models must take proliferation status into account to avoid masking regulatory interactions that may be of significance in vivo.</p>

<p>A 0.5 kb fragment of Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using primers based on consensus sequences of cysteine synthase isozyme A from bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PCR product resembled not only cysteine synthase sequences from prokaryotes and eukaryotes but also eukaryotic cystathionine beta-synthase sequences. Probing an Str. venezuelae genomic library with the PCR product located a hybridizing colony from which pJV207 was isolated. Sequencing and analysis of the Str. venezuelae DNA insert in pJV207 detected two ORFs. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORF1 matched both cysteine synthase and cystathionine beta-synthase sequences in GenBank, but its size favoured assignment as a cystathionine beta-synthase. ORF2 in the pJV207 insert was unrelated in function to ORF1; in its sequence the deduced product resembled acetyl-CoA transferases, but disruption of the ORF did not cause a detectable phenotypic change. Disruption of ORF1 failed to elicit cysteine auxotrophy in wild-type Str. venezuelae, but in the cys-28 auxotroph VS263 it prevented restoration of prototrophy with homocysteine or methionine supplements. The change in phenotype implicated loss of the transsulfuration activity that in the wild-type converts these supplements to cysteine. This study concludes that disruption of ORF1 inactivates a cbs gene, the product of which participates in cysteine synthesis by transsulfuration. Enzyme assays of Str. venezuelae mycelial extracts confirmed the formation of cysteine by thiolation of O-acetylserine, providing the first unambiguous detection of this activity in a streptomycete. Enzyme assays also detected cystathionine gamma-synthase, cystathionine beta-lyase and cystathionine gamma-lyase activity in the extracts and showed that the substrate for cystathionine gamma-synthase was O-succinyl-homoserine. Based on assay results, the cys-28 mutation in Str. venezuelae VS263 does not inactivate the cysteine synthase gene but impairs expression in cultures grown in minimal medium.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Even moderate increases in levels of homocysteine cause cardiovascular degeneration. Various genetic and nutritional factors affect plasma homocysteine concentrations, and hyperhomocysteinemia damages vascular endothelial cells; hence their functions are disrupted. In diabetes mellitus, homocysteine metabolism is altered and as a result, more severe diabetic complications are expected when hyperhomocysteinemia occurs.METHODS: In the present study we experimentally induced diabetes in rats and examined effects of low or high dose of insulin administration on homocysteine metabolism.RESULTS: We determined that homocysteine levels were reduced in STZ-induced diabetic rats. This reduction was normalized by insulin in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, increased levels of lipid parameters (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL) were reduced by insulin.CONCLUSIONS: Hcy level in experimentally induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is decreased and injection of insulin normalizes Hcy levels in a dose-dependent manner. We speculate that insulin increases activities of enzymes of transsulfuration and remethylation reactions and hence speeds up conversion of Hcy to methionine and cysteine.</p>

<p>Leishmania and Trypanosoma are two genera of the protozoal Order Kinetoplastida that cause widespread diseases of humans and their livestock. The production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates by the host plays an important role in the control of infections by these organisms. Signal transduction and its redox regulation have not been studied in any depth in trypanosomatids, but homologs of the redox-sensitive signal transduction machinery of other eukaryotes have been recognized. These include homologs of activator protein-1, human apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ref-1) endonuclease, iron-responsive protein, protein kinases, and phosphatases. The detoxification of peroxide is catalyzed by a trypanothione-dependent system that has no counterpart in mammals, and thus ranks as one of the biochemical peculiarities of trypanosomatids. There is substantial evidence that trypanothione is essential for the survival of Trypanosoma brucei and for the virulence of Leishmania spp. Apart from trypanothione and its precursors, trypanosomatids also possess significant amounts of N(1)-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine or ovothiol A, but its function in the trypanosomatids is not presently understood. The biosynthesis of ovothiol A in Crithidia fasciculata proceeds by addition of sulfur from cysteine to histidine to form 4-mercaptohistidine. S-(4’-L-Histidyl)-L-cysteine sulfoxide is the transsulfuration intermediate. 4-Mercaptohistidine is subsequently methylated with S-adenosylmethionine as the likely methyl donor.</p>

<p>Regulation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and the SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio by the key cytosolic enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is essential in optimizing methyl group supply and subsequent functioning of methyltransferase enzymes. Therefore, inappropriate activation of GNMT may lead to the loss of methyl groups vital for many SAM-dependent transmethylation reactions. Previously, we demonstrated that the retinoid derivatives 13-cis- (CRA) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) mediated both the activity of GNMT and its abundance. The present study was conducted to determine whether vitamin A had a similar ability to up-regulate GNMT and to assess the biological importance of GNMT modulation by examining both the transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways after retinoid treatment. Rats were fed a control (10% casein + 0.3% L-methionine) diet and orally given retinyl palmitate (RP), CRA, ATRA or vehicle daily for 10 d. RP, CRA and ATRA elevated hepatic GNMT activity 32, 74 and 124%, respectively, compared with the control group. Moreover, the retinoid-mediated changes in GNMT activity were reflected in GNMT abundance (38, 89 and 107% increases for RP-, CRA-, and ATRA-treated rats, respectively). In addition, hepatic DNA, a substrate for SAM-dependent transmethylation, was hypomethylated (approximately 100%) after ATRA treatment compared with the control group. In contrast, the transsulfuration product glutathione was unaffected by retinoid treatment. These results provide evidence of the following: 1) vitamin A, like its retinoic acid derivatives, can induce enzymatically active GNMT; and 2) inappropriate induction of GNMT can lead to a biologically important loss of methyl groups and the subsequent impairment of essential transmethylation processes.</p>

<p>A direct sulfhydrylation pathway for methionine biosynthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum was found. The pathway was catalyzed by metY encoding O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase. The gene metY, located immediately upstream of metA, was found to encode a protein of 437 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 46,751 Da. In accordance with DNA and protein sequence data, the introduction of metY into C. glutamicum resulted in the accumulation of a 47-kDa protein in the cells and a 30-fold increase in O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase activity, showing the efficient expression of the cloned gene. Although disruption of the metB gene, which encodes cystathionine gamma-synthase catalyzing the transsulfuration pathway of methionine biosynthesis, or the metY gene was not enough to lead to methionine auxotrophy, an additional mutation in the metY or the metB gene resulted in methionine auxotrophy. The growth pattern of the metY mutant strain was identical to that of the metB mutant strain, suggesting that both methionine biosynthetic pathways function equally well. In addition, an Escherichia coli metB mutant could be complemented by transformation of the strain with a DNA fragment carrying corynebacterial metY and metA genes. These data clearly show that C. glutamicum utilizes both transsulfuration and direct sulfhydrylation pathways for methionine biosynthesis. Although metY and metA are in close proximity to one another, separated by 143 bp on the chromosome, deletion analysis suggests that they are expressed independently. As with metA, methionine could also repress the expression of metY. The repression was also observed with metB, but the degree of repression was more severe with metY, which shows almost complete repression at 0.5 mM methionine in minimal medium. The data suggest a physiologically distinctive role of the direct sulfhydrylation pathway in C. glutamicum.</p>

<p>There are two major pathways for methionine biosynthesis in micro-organisms. Little is known about these pathways in Bacillus subtilis. The authors assigned a function to the metI (formerly yjcI) and metC (formerly yjcJ) genes of B. subtilis by complementing Escherichia coli metB and metC mutants, analysing the phenotype of B. subtilis metI and metC mutants, and carrying out enzyme activity assays. These genes encode polypeptides belonging to the cystathionine gamma-synthase family of proteins. Interestingly, the MetI protein has both cystathionine gamma-synthase and O-acetylhomoserine thiolyase activities, whereas the MetC protein is a cystathionine beta-lyase. In B. subtilis, the transsulfuration and the thiolation pathways are functional in vivo. Due to its dual activity, the MetI protein participates in both pathways. The metI and metC genes form an operon, the expression of which is subject to sulfur-dependent regulation. When the sulfur source is sulfate or cysteine the transcription of this operon is high. Conversely, when the sulfur source is methionine its transcription is low. An S-box sequence, which is located upstream of the metI gene, is involved in the regulation of the metIC operon. Northern blot experiments demonstrated the existence of two transcripts: a small transcript corresponding to the premature transcription termination at the terminator present in the S-box and a large one corresponding to transcription of the complete metIC operon. When methionine levels were limiting, the amount of the full-length transcript increased. These results substantiate a model of regulation by transcription antitermination.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Hyperhomocysteinemia is regarded as a public health problem of increasing importance likely to contribute to vascular disorders and premature mortality. Folate, cobalamin, pyridoxine, and riboflavin dietary deficiencies are currently regarded as causative factors. However, several investigations have indicated that the theory of vitamin B deprivation provides only a partial explanation for the observed abnormalities of sulfur-containing amino acids. We investigated the potential contributory role played by protein malnutrition.METHODS: For that purpose, three cohorts of 20 adult patients presenting stage I, II, and III goiter underwent careful medical history, dietary inquiry, and clinical examination. Their overall health and nutrition states were assessed with classic anthropometry, measurement of vitamin B blood parameters, visceral protein markers, essential amino acids, total homocysteine, and cystathionine.RESULTS: The concentrations of transthyretin, seven essential amino acids, and cystathionine progressively decreased as the thyroid gland increased. Methionine was the sole essential amino acid whose values did not change; total homocysteine was unique in that increased levels correlated negatively with transthyretin values. Taken together, the data point to a progressive deterioration of protein nutrition status impairing the transsulfuration pathway and is best explained by an acquired defect of cystathionine-beta-synthase activity.CONCLUSIONS: Hyperhomocysteinemia may arise from the shrinking of endogenous nitrogen pools as a result of decreased protein intake or stress-induced increased losses. Raised total homocysteine may result from the attempt of the malnourished and/or stressed body to preserve methionine homeostasis.</p>

<p>Intracellular reduction-oxidation status is increasingly recognized as a primary regulator of cellular growth and development. The relative reduction-oxidation state of the cell depends primarily on the precise balance between concentrations of reactive oxygen species and the cysteine-dependent antioxidant thiol buffers glutathione and thioredoxin, which by preferentially reacting with reactive oxygen species, protect other intracellular molecules from oxidative damage. The transsulfuration pathway constitutes the major route of cysteine biosynthesis, and may thus be central in controlling the intracellular reduction-oxidation state and the balance between self-renewal and differentiation programs. This review discusses new findings on reciprocal reduction-oxidation modulation of enzymes involved in the transsulfuration and glutathione biosynthesis pathways, as well as studies elucidating the impact of sulfur amino acid availability on these pathways.</p>

<p>Adverse effects of high vitamin B(6) intake include peripheral neuropathy. Recent studies focussing on the reduction of plasma homocysteine as a risk factor for vascular disease showed that vitamin B(6) reduces plasma folate levels. The significance of this finding is unclear. We therefore analyzed plasma folate and basal homocysteine levels as well as the response to an oral methionine loading test in 8 healthy individuals before and after a controlled supplementation with oral doses of 25 mg pyridoxine for 10 days. Plasma pyridoxal phosphate increased from 40.6 +/- 13.6 to 426.8 +/- 200.3 nmol/l (p &lt; 0.001), whereas plasma folate decreased from 6.3 +/- 1.6 to 4.6 +/-1.5 ng/ml (p &lt; 0.01), respectively. Plasma vitamin B(12) and basal homocysteine levels remained unchanged (234.0 +/- 27.8 vs. 217.1 +/- 50.4 pg/ml and 10.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 10.1 +/- 3.6 micromol/l). There was no significant effect of vitamin B(6) supplementation on the area under methionine and homocysteine concentration versus time curve. Significant correlations were found between pre- and post-supplement levels of folate as well as PLP levels (r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.75, p &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that a dose of 25 mg vitamin B(6) supplemented for 10 days reduces plasma folate but did not affect basal and postprandial homocysteine levels suggesting (1) a normal cellular availability of folate or (2) a compensation of impaired homocysteine remethylation by increased transsulfuration.</p>

<p>An elevated level of plasma homocysteine, sulfur containing amino acid generated through demethylation of methionine has been widely accepted as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increase can result from genetic and/or nutrient related disturbances in the remethylation or transsulfuration pathways for homocysteine metabolism. A common mutation (C677T) in the gene encoding for the enzyme 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) or deficiency of the B vitamins namely folic acid, B(12), B(6) can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia.In the present study, we have investigated the incidence of the (C677T) MTHFR polymorphism in the North Indian males. 141 angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 55 age and sex matched healthy volunteers were examined for the association between MTHFR gene polymorphism and CAD. The MTHFR genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction-isotyping with Hinf 1 endonuclease. A trend for higher ‘T’ allele frequency (0.19) was observed in patients than in controls (0.16). However no significant association was found between C677T mutation and CAD severity. The lack of statistical significance could be due to the small sample size studied. Hence a larger study including various ethnic groups is warranted.</p>

In addition, several factors (i.e., drugs) may change the nutritional modulation, altering the normal functioning of the methionine/methylation cycle. The metabolism of a substrate is closely linked to that of it cofactors: in the case of homocysteine, there are three vitamins acting as cofactors or coenzymes: B6, B12 and folate. Vitamin B6 is involved in the formation of cystathionine from homocysteine (transsulfuration pathway). It is also critical for the formation of 5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate from tetrahydrofolate (folic acid derivatives), and therefore is closely related to the metabolism of folate. The latter is in conjunction with vitamin B12 involved in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. This reaction is B12-dependent. Different animal and human studies have proved the existence of a relation between vitamin status and homocysteine. Other dietary components as methionine content, riboflavin, alcohol or coffee consumption are being investigated in relation to homocysteine concentration. Drugs may interfere with the utilization of nutrients. This fact may be of special importance for vitamins (i.e., folate). Administration of drugs in populations with adequate vitamin intake is not usually a problem, but the existence of risk groups (the elderly, adolescents, smokers, dieters, etc.) may lead to specific vitamin deficiencies which may lead to elevated homocysteine. The case of folate is analysed since this vitamin shows the most reported number of interactions with drugs.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is an emerging new risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is a thiol compound derived from methionine and involved in two main metabolic pathways: the cycle of activated methyl groups, requiring folate and vitamin B12 as cofactors, and the transsulfuration pathway to cystathionine and cysteine requiring vitamin B6 as cofactor. The homocysteine metabolism represents an interesting model of gene-environment interaction. Elevations in homocysteine may be caused by genetic defects in enzymes involved in its metabolism or by deficiencies in cofactor levels. A common polymorphism in the gene coding for the 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (C677T, Ala –&gt; Val) is associated with a decreased activity of the enzyme due to thermolability. In case of homozygosity for the Val allele, a relative deficiency in the remethylation process of homocysteine into methionine leads to a mild-to-moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition recognized as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. The genetic influence of the MTHFR polymorphism on homocysteine levels is attenuated in females in premenopausal age and is not significant in subjects who exhibit serum levels of folate and/or vitamin B12 above the 50th percentile of distribution in the general population. The prevalence of the Val/Val genotype varies among different ethnic groups. It is very low in African populations, whereas in Europe and North America it ranges between 5% and 15%. In Italy an even higher prevalence has been reported in some regions. The question whether the MTHFR polymorphism might be per se an independent contributor to cardiovascular risk is debated. The interaction between this or other genetic factors and environmental/nutritional conditions (i.e. intake of vitamins such as folate) is a key determinant for homocysteine concentrations in healthy conditions as well as in some disease (i.e. in renal disorders). Another example of gene/environment interaction in the field of atherosclerosis is given by the apolipoprotein E polymorphism and its influence in response to diet. The presence of a high prevalence of risk-related allelic variants of such candidate genes within a certain population could serve to locally reinforce the recommendations concerning nutrient intake.</p>

<p>Crude extracts of Crithidia fasciculata catalyse the formation of 4-mercapto-L-histidine, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of ovothiol A (N1-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine), in the presence of histidine, cysteine, Fe2+ and pyridoxal phosphate. This activity was present in a 35-55% ammonium sulfate fraction that was shown to produce a transsulfuration intermediate in the absence of pyridoxal phosphate. The transsulfuration intermediate was isolated and identified as S-(4’-L-histidyl)-L-cysteine sulfoxide. The synthase activity, partially purified by anion-exchange chromatography, was shown to require oxygen and could be used to synthesize a number of isotopically labeled S-(4’-L-histidyl)-L-cysteine sulfoxides. Sulfoxide lyase activity was partially resolved from the synthase by anion-exchange chromatography. The phenylhydrazone of the product derived from the cysteine moiety of the sulfoxide coeluted with the phenylhydrazone of pyruvate on HPLC, but this assignment could not be confirmed by mass spectral analysis. S-(4’-[14C]L-histidyl)-[U-13C3,15N]L-cysteine sulfoxide was synthesized and converted to products of the lyase reaction in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase and NADH. The 13C-labeled product was identified by 13C-NMR spectroscopy as lactate and the primary product of the lyase reaction is therefore pyruvate. With S-(4’[3H]L-histidyl)-[14C]L-cysteine sulfoxide as the substrate [14C]lactate, [14C]cysteine and [3H]4-mercaptohistidine could be detected as products of the lyase reaction, but the sum of the two thiol species exceeded the amount of sulfoxide substrate used. Evidence is presented that this anomaly was due to the utilization of sulfur from dithiothreitol for the formation of cysteine.</p>

<p>Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is very frequent in renal patients. Aside from homocysteine (HCY) itself, the metabolites methylmalonic acid (MMA) and cystathionine (CYS) supply further information about disturbances in HCY metabolism. In two groups of renal patients, transplant and hemodialysis patients, we measured HCY, MMA and CYS and evaluated their diagnostic value for impaired HCY metabolism due to vitamin deficiency and renal insufficiency. We investigated serum samples from 63 transplant patients and 38 patients undergoing hemodialysis. HCY, MMA and CYS were assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, vitamin B6 by HPLC, B12 and folate by chemiluminescence immunoassay. The determination of HCY, MMA, and CYS in renal patients provides specific information about intracellular disturbances of HCY metabolism. The frequency of increased metabolite levels in renal patients was much higher than the frequency of lowered vitamin concentrations in serum. Furthermore, the metabolite levels in transplant patients were only moderately increased, whereas they were strongly increased in patients on hemodialysis (HCY 19.2 vs. 28.8 micromol/l, MMA 292 vs. 1025 nmol/l, CYS 733 vs. 2711 nmol/l). Our findings may support the use of MMA determination in the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency in renal patients. Compared to vitamin B12 deficiency, renal dysfunction itself appears to cause only a modest elevation in serum MMA. Regression analysis revealed that the moderate elevation of HCY and CYS in transplant patients is mainly a consequence of impaired remethylation of HCY to methionine with activated transsulfuration, whereas the mildly elevated MMA level is attributable to renal dysfunction. In patients on hemodialysis, all three metabolites were markedly elevated, indicating a strongly disturbed HCY metabolism. Based on a backward regression, we discovered that the HCY metabolism was strongly disturbed by renal insufficiency and vitamin deficiency. The markedly elevated HCY level was mainly attributable to functional vitamin B12 deficiency indicated by high MMA, and the strong CYS elevation was due to renal dysfunction and inhibition of this pathway by low levels of vitamin B6. In conclusion, besides HCY, the determination of MMA and CYS levels supports an early diagnosis of B-vitamin deficiency in renal patients. MMA is a more sensitive indicator of intracellular vitamin B12 deficiency than vitamin B12 in serum.</p>

<p>Increased concentrations of homocysteine probably contribute to the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and are determined by a variety of factors such as age, residual renal function, and vitamin status. Fasting plasma concentrations of total homocysteine, methionine, cysteine, and cystathionine were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in 131 ESRD patients receiving daily oral folate (160-320 microg) and vitamin B6 (10-20 mg) supplements. Concentrations of homocysteine determined by GC-MS were compared with those measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and an immunofluorescence method (IMx analyzer) using Passing-Bablok regression analysis. Mean plasma concentration of total homocysteine determined by GC-MS (28.7+/-11.9 micromol/l [mean+/-SD]) was significantly lower than that determined by HPLC (34.0+/-14.5 micromol/l; p&lt;0.001) or IMx (32.4+/-13.9 micromol/l; p&lt;0.001). A close correlation existed between GC-MS and HPLC (r=0.931; y=1.203 x+0.279) and GC-MS and IMx (r=0.896; y=1.105 x+0.766). Linear regression analysis showed positive correlations between plasma concentrations of homocysteine and cysteine (r=0.434; p&lt;0.001) and homocysteine and cystathionine (r=0.187; p=0.032). Plasma concentrations of homocysteine correlated negatively with folate (r=-0.281; p=0.001) and vitamin B12 (r=-0.229; p=0.009). GC-MS proved to be a sensitive and reliable method for the determination of total plasma homocysteine and related amino acids. Despite vitamin supplementation, ESRD patients requiring chronic maintenance hemodialysis, have high plasma concentrations of homocyst(e)ine which seems to be metabolized mainly within the transsulfuration pathway, while remethylation to methionine seems to be disturbed.</p>

<p>The oah1 gene of an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8, was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells. The gene product having a high O-acetyl-L-homoserine sulfhydrylase (EC 4.2.99.10) activity was purified to homogeneity, with a recovery of approximately 40% and a purification ratio of 81-fold, both calculated from the cell-homogenate. The protein showed molecular masses of approximately 163000 (for the native form) and 47000 (for the subunit). The isoelectric point was pH 6.0. The optimum temperature and pH for the activity were approximately 70 degrees C and pH 7.8, respectively. The enzyme was also shown to be very stable at high temperature (90% activity remaining at 90 degrees C for 60 min at pH 7.8) and in a wide range of pH (pH 4-12 at room temperature). The absorption spectrum showed a peak at 425 nm, and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.1 mM) inhibited approximately 90% of the activity, suggesting formation of a Schiff base with pyridoxal 5’-phosphate. The enzyme showed an apparent K(m) value of 6.8 mM for O-acetyl-L-homoserine, a V(max) value of 165 micromol/min per mg of protein at a fixed sulfide concentration of 5 mM, and also an apparent K(m) value of approximately 1.3 mM for sulfide (with 25 mM acetylhomoserine). L-Methionine (1 mM) inhibited the enzyme activity by 67%. Based on these findings, it was discussed that this enzyme might be inactive under ordinary conditions but might become active as an alternative homocysteine synthase in T. thermophilus HB8, only under such conditions as deficiency in transsulfuration, bringing about a sufficient amount of sulfide available in the cell.</p>

<p>An elevated plasma level of homocysteine is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of glucagon on homocysteine metabolism in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 4 mg/kg/day (3 injections per day) glucagon for 2 days while control rats received vehicle injections. Glucagon treatment resulted in a 30% decrease in total plasma homocysteine and increased hepatic activities of glycine N-methyltransferase, cystathionine beta-synthase, and cystathionine gamma-lyase. Enzyme activities of the remethylation pathway were unaffected. The 90% elevation in activity of cystathionine beta-synthase was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in its mRNA level. Hepatocytes prepared from glucagon-injected rats exported less homocysteine, when incubated with methionine, than did hepatocytes of saline-treated rats. Flux through cystathionine beta-synthase was increased 5-fold in hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats as determined by production of (14)CO(2) and alpha-[1-(14)C]ketobutyrate from l-[1-(14)C]methionine. Methionine transport was elevated 2-fold in hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats resulting in increased hepatic methionine levels. Hepatic concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, allosteric activators of cystathionine beta-synthase, were also increased following glucagon treatment. These results indicate that glucagon can regulate plasma homocysteine through its effects on the hepatic transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>The xanthine oxidase class of molybdenum enzyzmes requires a terminal sulfur ligand at the active site. It has been proposed that a special sulfurase catalyzes the insertion of this ligand thereby activating the enzymes. Previous analyses of mutants in plants indicated that the genetic locus aba3 is involved in this step leading to activation of the molybdenum enzymes aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase. Here we report the cloning of the aba3 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana and the biochemical characterization of the purified protein. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with a N-terminal NifS-like sulfurase domain and a C-terminal domain that might be involved in recognizing the target enzymes. Molecular analysis of three aba3 mutants identified mutations in both domains. ABA3 contains highly conserved binding motifs for pyridoxal phosphate and for a persulfide. The purified recombinant protein possesses a cysteine desulfurase activity, is yellow in color, and shows a NifS-like change in absorbance in the presence of L-cysteine. Pretreatment of ABA3 with a thiol-specific alkylating reagent inhibited its desulfurase activity. These data indicate a transsulfuration reaction similar to bacterial NifS. In a fully defined in vitro system, the purified protein was able to activate aldehyde oxidase by using L-cysteine as sulfur donor. Finally, we show that the expression of the aba3 gene is inducible by drought-stress.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), condensing homocysteine and serine, represents a key regulatory point in the biosynthesis of cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. Inherited deficiency of CBS causes homocystinuria. CBS is activated by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) by inducing a conformational change involving a noncatalytic C-terminal region spanning residues 414-551. We report the purification of two patient-derived C-terminal mutant forms of CBS, S466L and I435T, that provide new insight into the mechanism of CBS regulation and indicate a regulatory function for the “CBS domain”. Both of these point mutations confer catalytically active proteins. The I435T protein is AdoMet inducible but is 10-fold less responsive than wild-type (WT) CBS to physiologically relevant concentrations of this compound. The S466L form does not respond to AdoMet but is constitutively activated to a level intermediate between those of WT CBS in the presence and absence of AdoMet. Both mutant proteins are able to bind AdoMet, indicating that their impairment is related to their ability to assume the fully activated conformation that AdoMet induces in WT CBS. We found that I435T and WT CBS can be activated by partial thermal denaturation but that the AdoMet-stimulated WT, S466L, and a truncated form of CBS lacking the C-terminal region cannot be further activated by this treatment. Tryptophan and PLP fluorescence data for these different forms of CBS indicate that activation by AdoMet, limited proteolysis, and thermal denaturation share a common mechanism involving the displacement of an autoinhibitory domain located in the C-terminal region of the protein.</p>

<p>Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is a putative risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Molecular studies have demonstrated increased plasma homocysteine levels in the presence of DNA mutations in either the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme found in the remethylation pathway or the enzyme cystathione beta-synthase (CBS) of the transsulfuration pathway. To determine whether the mutation C–&gt;T677 in the MTHFR gene or the T–&gt;C833/844ins68 and G–&gt;A919 mutations in the CBS gene are associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in African Americans, DNA was analyzed from samples obtained from a case-control study conducted at a large, inner-city hospital. One-hundred ten African American subjects with a diagnosis of MI and 185 race- and age-matched controls were recruited. Our results demonstrated that 15% of the MI cases were heterozygous for the C–&gt;T677 (MTHFR) mutation, while 1.8% were homozygous. When compared to the controls in which 15% were heterozygous and 2.1% were homozygous, no significant association with MI was observed. In addition, 34% of the cases were heterozygous for the T–&gt;C833 (CBS) mutation while 6% were homozygous. This is compared to 32% and 5% of the controls having the heterozygous and homozygous genotype, respectively. No significant association was observed for the T–&gt;C833 (CBS) mutation among the cases and controls. Although this mutation has no significant association with MI, the prevalence of the heterozygous state was higher than what has been reported for whites (12%). No mutations for G–&gt;A919 (CBS) were detected in the cases or controls. The racial differences of the CBS T–&gt;C833 polymorphism suggest that further investigation into the other areas of the CBS gene is needed.</p>

Elevation of plasma homocysteine arises from disrupted of its metabolism (remethylation to methionine and transsulfuration to cystathionine) and is a function of a complex interaction between multiple genetic and environmental factors. Hyperhomocysteinemia, a conditions that recent epidemiological studies have shown to be associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases, may be a equal importance to hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking in etiology of atherosclerosis. Based on the role of folic acid, vitamin B12 and B6 in homocysteine metabolism supplementation with these vitamins in treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia both in cardiovascular diseases and neural tube defects is reviewed.</p>

<p>The metC gene encoding the cystathionine beta-lyase, the third enzyme in the methionine biosynthetic pathway, was isolated from Corynebacterium glutamicum by heterologous complementation of the Escherichia coli metC mutant. A DNA-sequence analysis of the cloned DNA identified two open-reading frames (ORFs) of ORF1 and ORF2 that consisted of 1,107 and 978 bp, respectively. A SDS-PAGE analysis identified a putative cystathionine beta-lyase band with approximate Mr of 41,000 that consisted of 368 amino acids encoded from ORF1. The translational product of the gene showed no significant homology with that of the metC gene from other organisms. Introduction of the plasmid containing the metC gene into C. glutamicum resulted in a 5-fold increase in the activity of the cystathionine beta-lyase. The putative protein product of ORF2, encoding a protein product of 35,574 Da, consisted of 325 amino acids and was identical to the previously reported aecD gene product, except for the existence of two different amino acids. Like the aecD gene, when present in multiple copies, the metC gene conferred resistance to S-(betaaminoethyl)-cysteine, which is a toxic lysine analog. However, genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the natural activity of the metC gene product is to mediate methionine biosynthesis in C. glutamicum. Mutant strains of metC were constructed, and the strains showed methionine prototrophy. The mutant strains completely lost their ability to show resistance to the S-(beta-aminoethyl)-cysteine. These results suggest that, in addition to the transsulfuration, other biosynthetic pathway(s), such as a direct sulfhydrylation pathway, may be functional in C. glutamicum as a parallel biosynthetic route for methionine.</p>

<p>Based on recent retrospective, prospective, and experimental studies, mild to moderate elevation of fasting or postmethionine-load plasma homocysteine is accepted as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and thrombosis in both men and women. Hyperhomocysteinemia results from an inhibition of the remethylation pathway or from an inhibition or a saturation of the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine metabolism. The involvement of a high dietary intake of methionine-rich animal proteins has not yet been investigated and cannot be ruled out. However, folate deficiency, either associated or not associated with the thermolabile mutation of the N(5,10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and vitamin B(6) deficiency, perhaps associated with cystathionine beta-synthase defects or with methionine excess, are believed to be major determinants of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease related to hyperhomocysteinemia. Recent experimental studies have suggested that moderately elevated homocysteine levels are a causal risk factor for atherothrombotic disease because they affect both the vascular wall structure and the blood coagulation system. The oxidant stress that results from impaired homocysteine metabolism, which modifies the intracellular redox status, might play a central role in the molecular mechanisms underlying moderate hyperhomocysteinemia-mediated vascular disorders. Because folate supplementation can efficiently reduce plasma homocysteine levels, both in the fasting state and after methionine loading, results from further prospective cohort studies and from on-going interventional trials will determine whether homocysteine-lowering therapies can contribute to the prevention and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Additionally, these studies will provide unequivocal arguments for the independent and causal relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and atherothrombotic disease.</p>

In rings with endothelium, isoniazid potentiated responses to isosorbide dinitrate at doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg; 3 and 300 mg/kg were without effect. In endothelium-denuded preparations, potentiation was present only at 10 mg/kg; 3 and 300 mg/kg inhibited relaxation. Other experiments indicated that isoniazid potentiation was prevented by pyridoxine, was reproduced with theophylline, and did not occur with 3-morpholinosydnonimine or papaverine. These results were deemed compatible with the hypothesis that isoniazid inhibits transsulfuration of homocysteine and causes its accumulation in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, where it functions as a thiol intermediate and leads to enhanced bioactivation of isosorbide dinitrate. Potentiation appeared to occur only with moderate increases of homocysteine.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is an amino acid and a product of methionine metabolism that is metabolized through two different enzymatic pathways: transsulfuration and remethylation. Vitamin B6 is important in homocysteine transsulfuration, whereas folate and vitamin B12 play significant roles in homocysteine remethylation. The hyperhomocysteinemia offers an explanation for observations on human arteriosclerosis that are difficult to explain by the cholesterol/fat approach. However, hyperhomocysteinemia can influence cognitive functions in the elderly. The causes of hyperhomocysteinemia are inherited and acquired. The treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia varies with underlying cause; generally, vitamin supplementation (with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12) is effective in reducing homocysteine concentrations. Also, specific recommendations, food fortification with folic acid, and preventive strategies in European countries (as in United States) are necessary to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>In Acremonium chrysogenum, biosynthesis of cysteine for the formation of cephalosporin has been proposed to occur through the reverse transsulfuration pathway. A gene, named mecB, has been cloned from an A. chrysogenum C10 genomic library in lambdaEMBL3-ble. The cloned DNA fragment encodes a protein of 423 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 45 kDa that shows great similarity to cystathionine-gamma-lyases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other eukaryotic organisms. The protein was shown to be functional because it restores growth on methionine to A. nidulans C47 (mecB10), a mutant that is known to be defective in cystathionine-gamma-lyase. The cloned gene did not complement A. nidulans mecA or metG mutants. Enzyme activity assays confirmed that the cloned mecB gene encodes a cystathionine-gamma-lyase activity. The mecB gene is present in a single copy in the wild-type A. chrysogenum (Brotzu’s strain) and also in the A. chrysogenum strain C10, a high cephalosporin producer. The gene is localized on chromosome VIII (5.3 Mb), as shown by hybridization to A. chrysogenum chromosomes resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Transcription of the mecB gene gives rise to a major transcript of 1.5 kb and a minor one of 1.7 kb. The transcript levels were not significantly affected by addition of DL-methionine to the culture, indicating that expression of this gene is not regulated by methionine. The availability of this gene provides a very useful tool for understanding the proposed role of cystathionine-gamma-lyase in splitting cystathionine to supply cysteine for cephalosporin biosynthesis.</p>

<p>Whole-blood free amino acids were measured in a control group made up of eight healthy women fasted for 12 h and also in eight patients with acute pancreatitis, five patients with acute cholecystitis and seven patients with acute appendicitis. Blood was withdrawn immediately on admission to hospital and again 3 d later following a controlled peripheral parenteral nutrition diet; this is with the exception of the appendicitis group. l-Cystathionine and l-methionine concentrations were significantly higher in pancreatitis and appendicitis patients when compared with controls. In the pancreatitis and cholecystitis patients, l-serine concentration was also significantly higher when compared with controls. The l-homocysteine concentration was significantly higher only in the appendicitis group when compared with the control group. l-Cystine concentration was unchanged in all the patients studied when compared with control subjects. The l-methionine : l-cystine ratio was significantly higher and the l-glutamine : l-cystine ratio was significantly lower in all the patients when compared with controls. The blood S-amino acid pattern reflects an impairment in liver transsulfuration pathway during acute abdominal processes. This work supports the idea that the l-methionine : l-cystine and l-glutamine : l-cystine ratios can be taken as good markers to evaluate the S-amino acid metabolism and suggests the importance of using N-acetylcysteine as a required nutrient in these situations.</p>

<p>Vitamin B6, measured as pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), is a co-enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine metabolism. Since depletion of PLP has been suggested as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, PLP is frequently measured to guide patient care. By a change and utilization of an Aquasil C18 column and the addition of an acetonitrile clean-up gradient to the potassium phosphate, with sodium perchlorate and bisulfite buffer between samples we report the modification of a previously described method for analysis of PLP. The result is a more practical, efficient, reliable and robust method for daily clinical use. We also determined and report that it is critical to protect freshly prepared standard PLP samples from light exposure during assay preparation.</p>

<p>A cell extract of an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus HB8, cultured in a synthetic medium catalyzed cystathionine gamma-synthesis with O-acetyl-L-homoserine and L-cysteine as substrates but not beta-synthesis with DL-homocysteine and L-serine (or O-acetyl-L-serine). The amounts of synthesized enzymes metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids were estimated by determining their catalytic activities in cell extracts. The syntheses of cystathionine beta-lyase (EC 4.4.1.8) and O-acetyl-L-serine sulfhydrylase (EC 4.2.99.8) were markedly repressed by L-methionine supplemented to the medium. L-Cysteine and glutathione, both at 0.5 mM, added to the medium as the sole sulfur source repressed the synthesis of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase by 55 and 73%, respectively, confirming that this enzyme functions as a cysteine synthase. Methionine employed at 1 to 5 mM in the same way derepressed the synthesis of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase 2.1- to 2.5-fold. A method for assaying a low concentration of sulfide (0.01 to 0.05 mM) liberated from homocysteine by determining cysteine synthesized with it in the presence of excess amounts of O-acetylserine and a purified preparation of the sulfhydrylase was established. The extract of cells catalyzed the homocysteine gamma-lyase reaction, with a specific activity of 5 to 7 nmol/min/mg of protein, but not the methionine gamma-lyase reaction. These results suggested that cysteine was also synthesized under the conditions employed by the catalysis of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase using sulfur of homocysteine derived from methionine. Methionine inhibited O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase markedly. The effects of sulfur sources added to the medium on the synthesis of O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase and the inhibition of the enzyme activity by methionine were mostly understood by assuming that the organism has two proteins having O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase activity, one of which is cystathionine gamma-synthase. Although it has been reported that homocysteine is directly synthesized in T. thermophilus HB27 by the catalysis of O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase on the basis of genetic studies (T. Kosuge, D. Gao, and T. Hoshino, J. Biosci. Bioeng. 90:271-279, 2000), the results obtained in this study for the behaviors of related enzymes indicate that sulfur is first incorporated into cysteine and then transferred to homocysteine via cystathionine in T. thermophilus HB8.</p>

<p>Targeted gene disruption efficiency in Acremonium chrysogenum was increased 10-fold by applying the double-marker enrichment technique to this filamentous fungus. Disruption of the mecB gene by the double-marker technique was achieved in 5% of the transformants screened. Mutants T6 and T24, obtained by gene replacement, showed an inactive mecB gene by Southern blot analysis and no cystathionine-gamma-lyase activity. These mutants exhibited lower cephalosporin production than that of the control strain, A. chrysogenum C10, in MDFA medium supplemented with methionine. However, there was no difference in cephalosporin production between parental strain A. chrysogenum C10 and the mutants T6 and T24 in Shen’s defined fermentation medium (MDFA) without methionine. These results indicate that the supply of cysteine through the transsulfuration pathway is required for high-level cephalosporin biosynthesis but not for low-level production of this antibiotic in methionine-unsupplemented medium. Therefore, cysteine for cephalosporin biosynthesis in A. chrysogenum derives from the autotrophic (SH(2)) and the reverse transsulfuration pathways. Levels of methionine induction of the cephalosporin biosynthesis gene pcbC were identical in the parental strain and the mecB mutants, indicating that the induction effect is not mediated by cystathionine-gamma-lyase.</p>

<p>Sulfur-containing amino acids play an important role in a variety of cellular functions such as protein synthesis, methylation, and polyamine and glutathione synthesis. We cloned and characterized cDNA encoding cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which is a key enzyme of transsulfuration pathway, from a hemoflagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi CBS, unlike mammalian CBS, lacks the regulatory carboxyl terminus, does not contain heme, and is not activated by S-adenosylmethionine. T. cruzi CBS mRNA is expressed as at least six independent isotypes with sequence microheterogeneity from tandemly linked multicopy genes. The enzyme forms a homotetramer and, in addition to CBS activity, the enzyme has serine sulfhydrylase and cysteine synthase (CS) activities in vitro. Expression of the T. cruzi CBS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli demonstrates that the CBS and CS activities are functional in vivo. Enzymatic studies on T. cruzi extracts indicate that there is an additional CS enzyme and stage-specific control of CBS and CS expression. We also cloned and characterized cDNA encoding serine acetyltransferase (SAT), a key enzyme in the sulfate assimilatory cysteine biosynthetic pathway. Dissimilar to bacterial and plant SAT, a recombinant T. cruzi SAT showed allosteric inhibition by l-cysteine, l-cystine, and, to a lesser extent, glutathione. Together, these studies demonstrate the T. cruzi is a unique protist in possessing both transsulfuration and sulfur assimilatory pathways.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: One-carbon metabolism involves both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of folate-dependent enzymes in mammalian cells, but few in vivo data exist to characterize the biochemical processes involved.OBJECTIVE: We conducted a stable-isotopic investigation to determine the fates of exogenous serine and serine-derived one-carbon units in homocysteine remethylation in hepatic and whole-body metabolism.DESIGN: A healthy man aged 23 y was administered [2,3,3-(2)H(3)]serine and [5,5,5-(2)H(3)]leucine by intravenous primed, constant infusion. Serial plasma samples were analyzed to determine the isotopic enrichment of free glycine, serine, leucine, methionine, and cystathionine. VLDL apolipoprotein B-100 served as an index of liver free amino acid labeling.RESULTS: [(2)H(1)]Methionine and [(2)H(2)]methionine were labeled through homocysteine remethylation. We propose that [(2)H(2)]methionine occurs by remethylation with [(2)H(2)]methyl groups (as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate) formed only from cytosolic processing of [(2)H(3)]serine, whereas [(2)H(1)]methionine is formed with labeled one-carbon units from mitochondrial oxidation of C-3 serine to [(2)H(1)]formate to yield cytosolic [(2)H(1)]methyl groups. The labeling pattern of cystathionine formed from homocysteine and labeled serine suggests that cystathionine is derived mainly from a serine pool different from that used in apolipoprotein B-100 synthesis.CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of both [(2)H(1)]- and [(2)H(2)]methionine forms indicates that both cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism of exogenous serine generates carbon units in vivo for methyl group production and homocysteine remethylation. This study also showed the utility of serine infusion and indicated functional roles of cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments in one-carbon metabolism.</p>

<p>Methionine transsulfuration in plasma and liver, and plasma methionine and cysteine kinetics were investigated in vivo during the acute phase of sepsis in rats. Rats were infected with an intravenous injection of live Escherichia coli, and control pair-fed rats were injected with saline. Two days after injection, the rats were infused for 6 h with [(35)S]methionine and [(15)N]cysteine. Transsulfuration was measured from the transfer rate of (35)S from methionine to cysteine. Liver cystathionase activity was also measured. Infection significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) the contribution of transsulfuration to cysteine flux in both plasma and liver (by 80%) and the contribution of transsulfuration to plasma methionine flux (by 133%). Transsulfuration measured in plasma was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in infected rats than in pair-fed rats (0.68 and 0.25 micromol. h(-1). 100 g(-1), respectively). However, liver cystathionase specific activity was decreased by 17% by infection (P &lt; 0.05). Infection increased methionine flux (16%, P &lt; 0.05) less than cysteine flux (38%, P &lt; 0.05). Therefore, the plasma cysteine flux was higher than that predicted from estimates of protein turnover based on methionine data, probably because of enhanced glutathione turnover. Taken together, these results suggest an increased cysteine requirement in infection.</p>

<p>The fasting plasma level of reduced glutathione (GSH), a methionine-derived tripeptide, is reduced in cirrhosis. There is evidence that a reduced activity of S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase limiting the flux of methionine along the transmethylation/transsulfuration pathway may contribute to decrease GSH levels. No studies have analyzed plasma GSH in response to a methionine load. In 6 control subjects and in 10 patients with cirrhosis, plasma sulfur amino acid and plasma and erythrocyte GSH levels were measured in response to a L-methionine load (0.1 g/kg). Blood samples were obtained throughout the day after the oral load. Urine was collected for measurement of sulfur excretion. During the study period, all subjects consumed a standard diet of 1,683 kcal containing 2% protein and virtually no methionine. Plasma methionine increased in both groups to a peak level exceeding 20 times the basal value 90 minutes after the load, and declined thereafter. Methionine clearance, calculated on the descending part of the methionine-time curve, was reduced by 50% in cirrhosis (P = .0001). Fasting GSH was higher in controls (mean +/- SD, 3.9 +/- 1.3 v 1.6 +/- 0.7 micromol/L, P = .0004). In response to a methionine load, it peaked at 10.2 +/- 7.2 and 3.2 +/- 1.3 micromol/L, respectively (P = .009). Thereafter, plasma GSH progressively declined, and after 24 hours, it returned to the fasting preinfusion values in both groups. Plasma cysteine and taurine concentrations, as well as the erythrocyte GSH time course, paralleled plasma GSH levels, with less significant differences between groups. Sulfate excretion was delayed. GSH synthesis is stimulated by a methionine load. The reduced flux of methionine along the transmethylation/transsulfuration pathway reduces GSH synthesis in cirrhosis. Defective methionine metabolism also may be responsible for reduced fasting GSH.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase [CBS; L-serine hydro-lyase (adding homocysteine), EC 4.2.1.22] catalyzes the first committed step of transsulfuration in both yeast and humans. It has been established previously that human CBS is a hemeprotein but although the heme group appears to be essential for CBS activity, the exact function of the heme group is unknown. CBS activity is absent in heme deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown without heme supplementation. CBS activity can be restored by supplementing these strains with heme, implying that there is a heme requirement for yeast CBS. We subcloned, overexpressed and purified yeast CBS. The yeast enzyme shows absolute pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) dependence for activity but we could find no evidence for the presence of a heme group. Given the degree of sequence and mechanistic similarity between yeast and human CBS, this result indicates that heme is unlikely to play a direct catalytic role in the human CBS reaction mechanism. Further characterization revealed that, in contrast to human CBS, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) does not activate yeast CBS. Yeast CBS was found to be coordinately regulated with proliferation in S. cerevisiae. This finding is the most likely explanation of the observed apparent heme dependence of transsulfuration in vivo.</p>

<p>The occurrence of methionine imbalance and toxicity was examined using 70- and 100-kg Holstein bull calves. The animals had been trained to maintain reflex closure of the reticular groove after weaning at 5 wk of age, and Trials 1 (n = 30) and 2 (n = 24) were conducted on animals at 7 and 12 wk of age, respectively. Calves received a corn-soybean meal diet in Trial 1 and a corn-corn gluten meal diet in Trial 2. In Trial 1, postruminal administration of 6 g of DL-methionine/d increased ADG, feed intake, gain/feed, and N retention compared with a control group receiving N-free supplement. However, the administration of 12 g of DL-methionine/d did not improve these variables, whereas both 18 and 24 g/d resulted in BW loss and decreased gain/feed and N utilization efficiency. In Trial 2, postruminal administration of 16 g/d of L-lysine from L-lysine monohydrochloride increased ADG, gain/feed, and N utilization efficiency compared with a control group receiving a N-free supplement. The administration of 8 g of DL-methionine/d in addition to L-lysine did not exert an adverse effect on these variables. However, the additional supplementation of 16 and 24 g of DLmethionine/d negated the improvement, whereas 32 g/d resulted in BW loss and decreased gain/feed and N utilization efficiency. These results showed that a methionine imbalance and toxicity occurred in calves with even a modest excess of DL-methionine, and 70-kg calves were more susceptible to methionine toxicity than 100-kg calves. Plasma concentrations of branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine linearly decreased with increasing amounts of additional DL-methionine from 0 to 32 g/d in Trial 2. However, such a decrease occurred mainly within the range from 0 to 12 g/d in Trial 1. This decrease was suggested to occur in relation to methionine metabolism via the transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a key junction metabolite in methionine metabolism. It suffers two major metabolic fates: transmethylation catalyzed by methionine synthase or betaine homocysteine methyl transferase and transsulfuration catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase leading to cystathionine. The latter is subsequently converted to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione. Studies with purified mammalian methionine synthase and cystathionine beta-synthase have revealed the oxidative sensitivity of both junction enzymes, suggesting the hypothesis that redox regulation of this pathway may be physiologically significant. This hypothesis has been tested in a human hepatoma cell line in culture in which the flux of homocysteine through transsulfuration under normoxic and oxidative conditions has been examined. Addition of 100 microM H(2)O(2) or tertiary butyl hydroperoxide increased cystathionine production 1.6- and 2.1-fold from 82 +/- 7 micromol h(-)(1) (L of cells)(-)(1) to 136 +/- 15 and 172 +/- 23 micromol h(-)(1) (L of cells)(-)(1), respectively. The increase in homocysteine flux through the transsulfuration pathway exhibited a linear dose dependence on the concentrations of both oxidants (50-200 microM H(2)O(2) and 10-200 microM tertiary butyl hydroperoxide). Furthermore, our results reveal that approximately half of the intracellular glutathione pool in human liver cells is derived from homocysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. The redox sensitivity of the transsulfuration pathway can be rationalized as an autocorrective response that leads to an increased level of glutathione synthesis in cells challenged by oxidative stress. In summary, this study demonstrates the importance of the homocysteine-dependent transsulfuration pathway in the maintenance of the intracellular glutathione pool, and the regulation of this pathway under oxidative stress conditions. Aberrations in this pathway could compromise the redox buffering capacity of cells, which may in turn be related to the pathophysiology of the different homocysteine-related diseases.</p>

<p>Two intersecting pathways, the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration sequence, compose the mechanisms for homocysteine metabolism in mammals. The methionine cycle occurs in all tissues and provides for the remethylation of homocysteine, which conserves methionine. In addition, the cycle is essential for the recycling of methyltetrahydrofolate. The synthesis of cystathionine is the first reaction in the irreversible pathway for the catabolism of homocysteine by means of the sequential conversion to cysteine and sulfate. This pathway has a limited distribution and is found primarily in the liver, kidney, small intestine and pancreas. Regulation of homocysteine metabolism is achieved by changes in the quantity of homocysteine distributed between the two competing pathways. Two mechanisms are basic to the regulatory process. Changes in tissue content of the relevant enzymes are the response to sustained perturbations. The inherent kinetic properties of the enzymes provide an immediate response to alterations in the tissue concentrations of substrates and other metabolic effectors. S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and methyltetrahydrofolate are of particular importance in that context.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the major metabolic block in the methionine catabolic pathway in cirrhotics exists at the level of the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase because in previous studies using conventional amino-acid analyzers, no intermediates of transmethylation/transsulfuration were found to accumulate in plasma downstream of S-adenosylmethionine synthesis. We therefore measured serum concentration intermediates of methionine transmethylation/transsulfuration using an improved gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique.METHODS: Serum concentrations of methionine, homocysteine, cystathionine, N,N-dimethylglycine, N-methylglycine, methylmalonic acid, 2-methylcitric acid and alpha-aminobutyric acid were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in 108 consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis at Child stages A (mild cirrhosis, n = 27) and B/C (severe cirrhosis, n = 81), 18 outpatients with non-cirrhotic liver disease, and 55 healthy individuals.RESULTS: Serum levels of methionine, N,N-dimethylglycine, N-methylglycine, cystathionine, and homocysteine were significantly higher in patients at Child stages B/C compared with those of healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01), and they were also significantly higher than in patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05 for homocysteine, respectively). They also correlated with the Child-Pugh score (P &lt; 0.01). Homocysteine, cystathionine, N,N-dimethylglycine, N-methylglycine, methylmalonic acid, and 2-methylcitric acid correlated with serum creatinine. The mean cystathionine concentration was significantly higher in patients with creatinine &gt; or = 1.4 mg/dl than in patients with normal creatinine values (P &lt; 0.01). However, the differences between cirrhotics and healthy controls were still significant after correcting for creatinine.CONCLUSIONS: Our data provides indirect evidence for two hitherto unrecognized alterations of methionine metabolism in cirrhotics, i.e. impairment of the transsulfuration of homocysteine at the level of cystathionine degradation and a shift in remethylation of homocysteine towards the betaine-homocysteine-methyltransferase reaction.</p>

<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thrombosis. Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with impaired endothelial function, but the mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia are poorly understood. We have used genetic and dietary approaches to produce hyperhomocysteinemia in mice. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice (CBS +/-), which have a selective defect in homocysteine transsulfuration, and wild-type (CBS +/+) littermates were fed either a control diet or a diet that is relatively deficient in folic acid for 6 wk. Plasma total homocysteine was 5.3 +/- 0.7 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 6.4 +/- 0.6 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.3) given the control diet. Plasma total homocysteine was 11.6 +/- 4.5 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 25.1 +/- 3.2 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.004) given a low-folate diet. In mice fed the control diet, relaxation of aortic rings in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine did not differ significantly between CBS +/+ mice and CBS +/- mice. In contrast, in mice fed a low-folate diet, maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was markedly impaired in CBS +/- mice (58 +/- 9%) compared with CBS +/+ mice (84 +/- 4%) (P = 0.01). No differences in relaxation to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside were observed among the four groups of mice. These data indicate that CBS-deficient mice are predisposed to hyperhomocysteinemia during dietary folate deficiency, and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with marked impairment of endothelial function in mice.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Total serum homocysteine (tHcy) has been used as an indicator of intracellular vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and folate status in adults, but data for neonates and infants are lacking. Vitamin B-12 deficiency may have fatal effects on neurologic development in infants; therefore, early diagnosis is crucial.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide a reference range for tHcy in neonates and to explore the relation of tHcy to 1) serum vitamin concentrations, 2) the product of the transsulfuration pathway (cysteine), and 3) nutritional factors.DESIGN: tHcy, cysteine, folate, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6 were measured in 123 healthy, breast-fed neonates. The influence of nutrition (formula or human milk) on these variables was investigated in 60 infants.RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) tHcy concentration was 7.8 +/- 3.1 micromol/L. tHcy showed a linear association with log vitamin B-12 (r = -0.64, P: &lt; 0. 001), red blood cell folate (r = -0.33, P: &lt; 0.001), and cysteine (r = 0.36, P: &lt; 0.001). The strongest linear association was found between tHcy and the ratio of log cysteine to log vitamin B-12 (r = 0.71, P: &lt; 0.0001). We found more neonates with probable tissue deficiencies of vitamin B-12 and folate on the basis of tHcy measurements than was expected from the analysis of serum vitamin concentrations alone (15.4% compared with 9.7%). Breast-fed infants had significantly lower vitamin B-12 concentrations and significantly higher serum tHcy and cysteine concentrations and ratios of log cysteine to log vitamin B-12 than did formula-fed infants (P: &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: tHcy can be used as a functional indicator of vitamin B-12 and folate status in neonates. The ratio of cysteine to vitamin B-12 can be used as an additional index of impaired intracellular Hcy metabolism. tHcy and cysteine concentrations in infants are affected by nutritional factors.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Elevated fasting homocysteine concentrations are considered a risk factor for vascular disease. Homocysteine, which is produced by the transmethylation of methionine, can be either remethylated back to methionine or metabolized via transsulfuration to cystathionine. It has been speculated that the lower risk of vascular disease among premenopausal women may be related to lower homocysteine concentrations in women than in men.OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether sex-related differences exist in methionine cycle kinetics, which may account for the reportedly lower fasting homocysteine concentrations in premenopausal women.DESIGN: Eleven healthy young men and 11 premenopausal women without cardiac risk factors were studied by using stable-isotope-labeled L-[methyl-(2)H(3),1-(13)C]methionine and L-[methyl- (2)H(3)]leucine. After 3 h of tracer infusion, 100 mg unlabeled L-methionine/kg body wt was ingested. Blood and breath samples were obtained at timed intervals. Fat-free mass was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and muscle mass by urinary creatinine excretion.RESULTS: No significant sex-related differences were found in fasting homocysteine concentrations, responses to the oral methionine load, or rates of methionine flux based on carboxyl or methyl labels. However, women had significantly higher remethylation rates than did men (P &lt; 0.005) and a tendency toward higher transmethylation (P &lt; 0.10). Whereas adjustment of remethylation rates for fat-free mass tended to attenuate the sex-related effect (P = 0.08), adjustment for muscle mass did not (P &lt; 0.04). In contrast, significant sex-related differences in leucine flux (P &lt; 0.02) were eliminated after adjustment for either fat-free mass or muscle mass.CONCLUSION: Reported differences between men and women in homocysteine concentrations may be partially explained by differences in rates of homocysteine remethylation.</p>

<p>Methionine (Met) is usually the first limiting amino acid for sheep and supplements of Met may increase production of wool and meat. The wool response may be due to an increased supply of cysteine (Cys) from transsulfuration (TS) of Met. Met is catabolized through homocysteine to form Cys when the S from Met is transferred to serine (Ser). We hypothesized that providing additional Met would create a deficiency of Ser and that by simultaneously providing Met and Ser, TS and wool growth could be increased more than by providing Met alone. The effects of i.v. infusions of Met and Ser to young Merino lambs on TS, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of protein in skin, follicle mRNA and wool growth were examined. Following 4 d of constant i.v. infusion of 3 g Met/d, or 10 g Ser/d or both, the isotope tracers: L-[3-(13)C]Cys, L-[ring-d5]phenylalanine (Phe) and L-[2,3,3-d3]Ser were infused over 8 h to allow for measurements of irreversible loss rate (ILR), and TS in whole body and skin. Skin biopsies were taken for measurement of FSR. Wool growth rate was measured using autoradiography. An infusion of Met significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved wool growth rate and increased skin FSR, Cys supply from TS and enhanced levels of follicle mRNA (from the K2.10 intermediate filament gene and three gene families encoding keratin associated proteins KAP1, KAP4 and KAP12). The extra Met lowered Ser ILR. The infusion of Ser doubled Ser ILR in the body and increased skin FSR calculated using the Cys tracer in plasma (P &lt; 0.05). However, there were no significant (P &gt; 0.05) changes in TS, skin FSR calculated using the Phe and Ser tracers, follicle mRNA or wool growth rate as a result of Ser infusion. While there were trends towards increased TS and FSR with Ser infusion, the overall lack of significant changes indicates a high capacity for the de novo synthesis of Ser.</p>

<p>Vitamin B-6 deficiency causes mild elevation in plasma homocysteine, but the mechanism has not been clearly established. Serine is a substrate in one-carbon metabolism and in the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine catabolism, and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) plays a key role as coenzyme for serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and enzymes of transsulfuration. In this study we used [(2)H(3)]serine as a primary tracer to examine the remethylation pathway in adequately nourished and vitamin B-6-deficient rats [7 and 0.1 mg pyridoxine (PN)/kg diet]. [(2)H(3)]Leucine and [1-(13)C]methionine were also used to examine turnover of protein and methionine pools, respectively. All tracers were injected intraperitoneally as a bolus dose, and then rats were killed (n = 4/time point) after 30, 60 and 120 min. Rats fed the low-PN diet had significantly lower growth and plasma and liver PLP concentrations, reduced liver SHMT activity, greater plasma and liver total homocysteine concentration, and reduced liver S-adenosylmethionine concentration. Hepatic and whole body protein turnover were reduced in vitamin B-6-deficient rats as evidenced by greater isotopic enrichment of [(2)H(3)]leucine. Hepatic [(2)H(2)]methionine production from [(2)H(3)]serine via cytosolic SHMT and the remethylation pathway was reduced by 80.6% in vitamin B-6 deficiency. The deficiency did not significantly reduce hepatic cystathionine-beta-synthase activity, and in vivo hepatic transsulfuration flux shown by production of [(2)H(3)]cysteine from the [(2)H(3)]serine increased over twofold. In contrast, plasma appearance of [(2)H(3)]cysteine was decreased by 89% in vitamin B-6 deficiency. The rate of hepatic homocysteine production shown by the ratio of [1-(13)C]homocysteine/[1-(13)C]methionine areas under enrichment vs. time curves was not affected by vitamin B-6 deficiency. Overall, these results indicate that vitamin B-6 deficiency substantially affects one-carbon metabolism by impairing both methyl group production for homocysteine remethylation and flux through whole-body transsulfuration.</p>

<p>S-Adenosyl-Lmethionine (SAM) is an important molecule in normal cell function and survival. SAM is utilized by three key metabolic pathways: transmethylation; transsulfuration; and polyamine synthesis. In transmethylation reactions, the methyl group of SAM is donated to a large variety of acceptor substrates including DNA, phospholipids and proteins. Thus, interference of these reactions can affect a wide spectrum of processes ranging from gene expression to membrane fluidity. In transsulfuration, the sulfur atom of the SAM is converted via a series of enzymatic steps to cysteine, a precursor of taurine and glutathione, a major cellular anti-oxidant. Polyamines are required for normal cell growth. Given the importance of SAM in tissue function, it is not surprising that this molecule is being investigated as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of various clinical disorders.</p>

<p>Homocysteine does not occur in the diet but it is an essential intermediate in normal mammalian metabolism of methionine. Each compound, methionine or homocysteine, is the precursor of the other. Similarly, the synthesis of one is the mechanism for the detoxification of the other. The ubiquitous methionine cycle is the metabolic basis for this relationship. In some tissues the transsulfuration pathway diverts homocysteine from the cycle and provides a means for the synthesis of cysteine and its derivatives. Methionine, (or homocysteine) metabolism is regulated by the disposition of homocysteine between these competing sequences. Both pathways require vitamin-derived cofactors, pyridoxine for transsulfuration and both folate and cobalamin in the methionine cycle. The clinical consequences of disruption of these pathways was apparent first in rare inborn errors of metabolism that cause homocystinuria, but recent studies focus on “hyperhomocysteinemia”–a lesser metabolic impairment that may result from genetic variations, acquired pathology, toxicity and nutritional inadequacy. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for thrombovascular diseases however it is not clear whether the minimally increased concentration of the amino acid is the causative agent or merely a marker for the pathology. Until we resolve that question we cannot predict the potential efficacy of therapies based on folate administration with or without additional cobalamin and pyridoxine.</p>

<p>The objective of this review is to present and discuss the current perspectives of homocysteine and one carbon metabolism in chronic alcoholism. Chronic alcoholics frequently suffer from specific micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamins involved in one carbon metabolism, i.e., folate, vitamin B(6) and vitamin B(12). The possible link between homocysteine and alcoholism stems from the fact that homocysteine metabolism is closely linked to the metabolism of these three vitamins. In fact, homocysteine stands at the intersection of two pathways: methylation and transsulfuration. In methylation, homocysteine acquires a methyl group from N-5-methyltetrahydrofolate in a vitamin B(12) dependent reaction, whereas in the transsulfuration pathway, homocysteine condenses with serine to form cystathionine in an irreversible reaction catalyzed by the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-containing enzyme, cystathionine-beta-synthase. Due to these relationships, nutritional deficiency of one of these vitamins, as a consequence of chronic alcohol intake, could lead to metabolic disruption and potentially to hyperhomocysteinemia. Consistent with an interference of alcohol in these metabolic pathways, a previous study performed in chronic alcoholics in whom hyperhomocysteinemia was observed along with disturbed vitamin status, DNA hypomethylation in peripheral lymphocytes was demonstrated as well. Because all these alterations were observed in the absence of clinically overt disease, one might speculate whether these metabolic abnormalities could be involved in the pathogenesis of organic diseases associated to chronic alcoholism.</p>

<p>This pictorial introduction to homocysteine illustrates at a glance the nature of homocysteine and its role in cardiovascular disease by means of eight simple figures and an essential bibliography. Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing metabolite of methionine. Conversion back to methionine or transsulfuration to cysteine are the two major metabolic pathways that reduce total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in cells and blood. B vitamins are essential cofactors in homocysteine metabolism. Median fasting total homocysteine levels in adult males are approximately 10 micromol/L. Increased plasma tHcy concentrations are found with methionine-rich diets, low vitamin B intake, male gender, age, impaired renal function, and genetically determined defects of the enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism. An inverse relation exists between plasma tHcy and circulating folate or vitamin B(6) concentrations, and folic acid supplements of 0.5 mg/d can reduce tHcy levels by approximately 25%. Homocystinuric patients, who have severe hyperhomocysteinemia, die prematurely of atherothrombotic disease. Many (but not all) cross-sectional and prospective studies indicate, on average, that plasma tHcy levels &lt;.10 micromol/L are associated with, or predict the development of, coronary, cerebral, and peripheral vascular disease. The risk conferred by hyperhomocysteinemia is graded and is independent of traditional risk factors, with an estimated odds ratio for ischemic heart disease of 1.4 for every 5 micromol/L increase in plasma tHcy. In vitro and in vivo, tHcy has been found to impair endothelial function. It is now well established that tHcy represents a marker of current or subsequent ischemic vascular disease. However, irrefutable proof that hyperhomocysteinemia actually causes atherothrombosis will come only if interventions to lower plasma tHcy will produce concomitant reductions in cardiovascular events.</p>

<p>The fasting serum concentrations of total homocysteine and metabolites of transsulfuration (cystathionine, cysteine, methylmalonic acid, 2-methylcitric acid) and remethylation (methionine) were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 40 nondialyzed patients with chronic renal disease and in 50 patients with end-stage renal disease requiring chronic maintenance hemodialysis. The nondialyzed patients and 28 of the dialysis patients did not receive additional vitamin supplementations. Twenty-two of the dialysis patients received daily oral vitamin preparations containing 10 mg pyridoxine (vitamin B(6)), 6 microg cyanocobalamin (vitamin B(12)), and 1 mg folic acid. In the nondialyzed patients, linear regression analysis showed positive correlations between serum concentrations of creatinine and total homocysteine (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.0001), cystathionine (r = 0.73, p &lt; 0. 0001), methylmalonic acid (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.0001), and 2-methylcitric acid (r = 0.81, p &lt; 0.0001).

There was no significant correlation between serum concentrations of homocysteine and methionine (r = -0.14, p = 0.63). In the hemodialysis patients receiving oral vitamin supplementation, serum homocysteine and cystathionine concentrations were significantly lower than in hemodialysis patients not receiving vitamins (homocysteine 21.8 +/- 1.1 vs. 33.2 +/- 3.7 micromol/l, p = 0.0004; cystathionine 2,075.9 +/- 387.1 vs. 3,171.3 +/- 680.2 nmol/l, p = 0. 02; mean +/- SEM).

<p>Homocysteine is a sulphur-containing amino acid formed during metabolism by one of two pathways by remethylation and transsulfuration. Altered homocysteine metabolism may be implicated as a factor in atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular disease or peripheral vascular disease. It is postulated that homocysteine may damage endothelial cells or acts as a direct causal factor in the thromboembolic process. Several studies have reported that there are a number of factors that may influence levels of homocysteine in humans. Serum homocysteine levels may be associated with low levels of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. These studies showed that serum homocysteine levels were higher in men and older adults, and some showed that there was a direct relationship between homocysteine and cigarette smoking, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Subjects who consume larger amounts of coffee were also noted to have higher serum homocysteine levels. Several cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies have linked homocysteinaemia with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. In the Framingham Heart Study, the cohort study in Tromso, Norway, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, homocysteine levels were found to be higher in adults with asymptomatic or symptomatic coronary artery disease. In the British Regional Heart Study, homocysteine levels were found to be significantly higher in patients with stroke. Thus, there are suggestions that vitamin therapy and alteration of lifestyle habits such as cigarette smoking may lower homocysteine levels. There may be less coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality with lower homocysteine levels.</p>

<p>In cyanide poisoning, metalloproteins and carbonyl groups containing proteins are the main target molecules of nucleophilic attack by cyanide. To defend against this attack, cyanide is metabolized to less toxic thiocyanate via transsulfuration. This reaction is catalyzed by rhodanese and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). Rhodanese is a well characterized mitochondrial enzyme. On the other hand, little was known about MST because it was unstable and difficult to purify. We first purified MST to homogeneity and cloned MST cDNA from rat liver to characterize MST. We also found that MST was an evolutionarily related enzyme of rhodanese. MST and rhodanese are widely distributed in rat tissues, and the kidney and liver prominently contain these enzymes. Immunohistochemical study revealed that MST is mainly distributed in proximal tubular epithelial cells in the kidney, pericentral hepatocytes in the liver, the perinuclear area of myocardial cells in the heart, and glial cells in the brain, and immunoelectron microscopical study concluded that MST was distributed in both cytoplasm and mitochondria, so that MST first detoxifies cyanide in cytoplasm and the cyanide which escapes from catalysis due to MST enters mitochondria. MST then detoxifies cyanide again in cooperation with rhodanese in mitochondria. Tissues other than the liver and kidney are more susceptible to cyanide toxicity because they contain less MST and rhodanese. Even in the same tissue, sensitivity to cyanide toxicity may differ according to the kind of cell. It is determined by a balance between the amount of proteins to be attacked and that of enzymes to defend.</p>

<p>gamma-Cystathionase deficiency (cystathioninemia-cystathioninuria) is a disorder of the transsulfuration pathway characterized by the accumulation of cystathionine in blood and urine. There are probably no clinical consequences. However, maternal gamma-cystathionase deficiency has not been reported. We studied 2 pregnancies and the offspring of these pregnancies in a woman with the pyridoxine-nonresponsive form of the disorder. The outcomes were favorable, suggesting that maternal gamma-cystathionase deficiency may not be deleterious to the pregnant woman or the fetus.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid intermediate involved in two metabolic pathways, in the remethylation to methionine and in the transsulfuration to cysteine. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia (&gt; 100 mumol/l) is found in congenital homocystinuria. Moderate (15-30 mumol/l) or intermediate (&gt; 30-100 mumol/l) hyperhomocysteinemia is caused by defects in genes encoding for enzymes of homocysteine metabolism or by inadequate intake of those vitamins that are involved in homocysteine metabolism (folic acid, cobalmin, and vitamin B6). Today, hyperhomocysteinemia should be considered an important risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular and venous thromboembolic diseases. Homocysteine-plasma levels above the 95th percentile were found to be associated with a 2 to 3-fold elevated relative risk for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Moreover, mild hyperhomocysteinemia has been shown to be associated with a 2 to 4-fold increased relative risk for coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Several mechanisms have been proposed by which hyperhomocysteinemia contributes to atherogenesis and thrombogenesis. Several studies have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia can be corrected by supplementation of folic acid, cobalamin and vitamin B6. Clinical trials are urgently needed which investigate the preventive effect of supplementation of these vitamins on thrombotic diseases.</p>

<p>Cysteine and methionine biosynthesis was studied in Pseudomonas putida S-313 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Both these organisms used direct sulfhydrylation of O-succinylhomoserine for the synthesis of methionine but also contained substantial levels of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (cysteine synthase) activity. The enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway (cystathionine gamma-synthase and cystathionine beta-lyase) were expressed at low levels in both pseudomonads but were strongly upregulated during growth with cysteine as the sole sulfur source. In P. aeruginosa, the reverse transsulfuration pathway between homocysteine and cysteine, with cystathionine as the intermediate, allows P. aeruginosa to grow rapidly with methionine as the sole sulfur source. P. putida S-313 also grew well with methionine as the sulfur source, but no cystathionine gamma-lyase, the key enzyme of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, was found in this species. In the absence of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, P. putida desulfurized methionine by the conversion of methionine to methanethiol, catalyzed by methionine gamma-lyase, which was upregulated under these conditions. A transposon mutant of P. putida that was defective in the alkanesulfonatase locus (ssuD) was unable to grow with either methanesulfonate or methionine as the sulfur source. We therefore propose that in P. putida methionine is converted to methanethiol and then oxidized to methanesulfonate. The sulfonate is then desulfonated by alkanesulfonatase to release sulfite for reassimilation into cysteine.</p>

<p>We have used a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques to measure factors regulating homocysteine metabolism and the plasma concentration of this atherogenic amino acid. The germane findings include: 1. Homocysteine metabolism in rat kidney proceeds predominantly through the transsulfuration pathway, whose enzymes are enriched within the proximal cells of kidney tubules. Furthermore, the rat kidney possesses significant reserve capacity to handle both acute and chronic elevations in plasma homocysteine concentrations. 2. Plasma homocysteine concentrations are lower in diabetic rats. Insulin administration corrects this perturbation. Therefore, insulin and/or one of its counter-regulatory hormones affects homocysteine metabolism, possibly through an increased flux in the hepatic transsulfuration pathway. In support of these data, glucagon administration to rats produced similar results. Further support was provided by studies with isolated rat hepatocytes, from which homocysteine export was reduced when incubated in the presence of glucagon.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia has a high prevalence in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population, which may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in these patients. The cause of hyperhomocysteinemia in renal failure is unknown, and therapies have not been able to normalize plasma homocysteine levels. Insight into methionine-homocysteine metabolism in ESRD is therefore necessary.METHODS: Using a primed, continuous infusion of [2H3-methyl-1-13C]methionine, we measured whole body rates of methionine and homocysteine metabolism in the fasting state in four hyperhomocysteinemic hemodialysis patients and six healthy control subjects.RESULTS: Remethylation of homocysteine was significantly decreased in the hemodialysis patients: 2.6+/-0.2 (SEM) vs. 3.8+/-0.3 micromol. kg(-1)x hr(-1) in the control subjects (P = 0.03), whereas transsulfuration was not 2.5+/-0.3 vs. 3.0+/-0.1 micromol. kg(-1) x hr(-1) (P = 0.11). The transmethylation rate was proportionally and significantly lower in the ESRD patients as compared with controls: 5.2+/-0.4 vs. 6.8+/-0.3 micromol. kg(-1) x hr(-1) (P = 0.02). Methionine fluxes to and from body protein were similar.CONCLUSIONS: The conversion of homocysteine to methionine is substantially (approximately 30%) decreased in hemodialysis patients, whereas transsulfuration is not. Decreased remethylation may explain hyperhomocysteinemia in ESRD. This stable isotope technique is applicable for developing new and effective homocysteine-lowering treatment regimens in ESRD based on pathophysiological mechanisms.</p>

<p>Homocysteine is a sulfur amino acid whose metabolism stands at the intersection of two pathways: remethylation to methionine, which requires folate and vitamin B12 (or betaine in an alternative reaction); and transsulfuration to cystathionine, which requires pyridoxal-5’-phosphate. The two pathways are coordinated by S-adenosylmethionine, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase reaction and as an activator of cystathionine beta-synthase. Hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition that recent epidemiological studies have shown to be associated with increased risk of vascular disease, arises from disrupted homocysteine metabolism. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia is due to rare genetic defects resulting in deficiencies in cystathionine beta synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, or in enzymes involved in methyl-B12 synthesis and homocysteine methylation. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia seen in fasting conditions is due to mild impairment in the methylation pathway (i.e. folate or B12 deficiencies or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase thermolability). Post-methionine-load hyperhomocysteinemia may be due to heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase defect or B6 deficiency. Early studies with nonphysiological high homocysteine levels showed a variety of deleterious effects on endothelial or smooth muscle cells in culture. More recent studies with human beings and animals with mild hyperhomocysteinemia provided encouraging results in the attempt to understand the mechanism that underlies this relationship between mild elevations of plasma homocysteine and vascular disease. The studies with animal models indicated the possibility that the effect of elevated homocysteine is multifactorial, affecting both the vascular wall structure and the blood coagulation system.</p>

<p>A moderately elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), whether measured during fasting or post-methionine load (PML), is recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery diseases (CAD). Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, is important for the metabolism of homocysteine. In recent years, a relatively prevalent mutation, the 844ins68 (68-bp insertion), was found to be carried by about 12% of the general population. In the current investigation, we studied 741 individuals with respect to the effect of the 68-bp insertion of the CBS gene on fasting and PML tHcy, and also determined the level of pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (vitamin B(6)), a cofactor of the CBS enzyme. Our results showed that the mean fasting and PML increase in tHcy levels were lower in individuals carrying the 844ins68 variant compared to those without the insertion; although only the difference in PML increase in tHcy reached statistical significance (P = 0.02). When these individuals were divided into two groups based on vitamin B(6) concentration, the PML increase in tHcy was significantly lower in individuals heterozygous for the insertion compared to those without the insertion only in the group of individuals whose vitamin B(6) concentrations were below the sample median (38.0 nmol/L). We speculate that the 68-bp insertion is associated with somewhat higher levels of CBS enzyme activity, and that the effect of this becomes more pronounced in the presence of relatively low concentrations of pyridoxal-5’-phosphate, a cofactor of the CBS enzyme.</p>

<p>The metB gene encoding cystathionine y-synthase, the second enzyme of methionine biosynthetic pathway, was isolated from a pSL109-based Corynebacterium glutamicum gene library via complementation of an Escherichia coli metB mutant. A DNA-sequence analysis of the cloned DNA identified an open-reading frame of 1161 bp which encodes a protein with the molecular weight of 41,655 comprising of 386 amino acids. The putative protein product showed good amino acid-sequence homology to its counterpart in other organisms. Introduction of a plasmid carrying the cloned metB into the C. glutamicum resulted in a 10-fold increase in cystathionine gamma-synthase activities, demonstrating the identity of the cloned gene. The C. glutamicum metB mutant which was generated by the site-specific integration of the cloned DNA into its chromosome did not lose the ability to grow on glucose minimal medium lacking supplemental methionine. The growth rate of the mutant strain was also comparable to that of the parental strain. These data indicate that, in addition to the transsulfuration pathway, other methionine biosynthetic pathways may be present in C. glutamicum.</p>

<p>Plasma homocysteine determination is essential for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism of sulfur amino acids and is achieving considerable importance as a possible risk marker in vascular occlusive pathology. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a fast and sensitive method to assay total and free homocysteine and total and free cysteine in plasma samples, using an automated precolumn sample pretreatment including reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, carboxymethylation of free thiols and derivation with o-phthalaldehyde. The chromatographic separation was accomplished in 7 min, the within-run and between-run R.S.D.s were all less than 4.3%, the response was linear in the range 0.4-150 microM for homocysteine and 4-1000 microM for cysteine and the mean recoveries were higher than 96%. Moreover, with minimal modification, the method allowed the evaluation of methionine, another important marker of transsulfuration and remethylation defects. The method was applied to the diagnosis of inborn errors involving sulfur amino acids metabolism and to detect mild hyperhomocysteinemia.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels, either measured in the fasting state or after oral methionine loading, are associated with an increased risk of atherothrombotic disease. Fasting and post-methionine hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) overlap to a limited extent; both can occur as familial traits. We investigated determinants of fasting, postmethionine and delta (ie, post-methionine minus fasting levels) tHcy levels in 510 subjects of 192 HHC-prone families including 161 patients with clinical vascular disease and 349 without vascular disease. We focused on tHcy levels in relation to levels of vitamin B12, B6 and folate and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation. Multivariate linear analyses adjusted for the presence of vascular disease showed that fasting tHcy was significantly related to folate and vitamin B12, and the presence of the MTHFR TT genotype and the T allele, and to age, smoking habits, and serum levels of creatinine. Both post-methionine and delta tHcy levels were related to serum folate levels, and the presence of the MTHFR TT genotype and the T allele, and to postmenopausal status, and body mass index. An interaction was found between MTHFR TT genotype and serum folate levels for both fasting and post-methionine tHcy, ie, for a given decrease in serum folate, homocysteine levels increased more in subjects with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype. Fasting, post-methionine and delta tHcy were higher in patients with vascular disease than in their healthy siblings, but these levels were less dependent on serum folate levels (P&lt;0.05), whereas the effect of MTHFR genotype was stronger (P=0.01). This study found evidence that post-methionine and delta tHcy levels are not only influenced by factors affecting homocysteine transsulfuration but also by factors that affect remethylation. The explained variances of fasting, post-methionine and delta tHcy were 49%, 62%, and 78%, respectively. We also found evidence, in patients with premature vascular disease but not in their healthy siblings, for a factor that increases tHcy levels but weakens the normal inverse relation between folate and tHcy and amplifies the effect of the MTHFR genotype.</p>

<p>The gene encoding human cystathionine gamma-lyase was cloned from total cellular Hep G2 RNA. Fusion to a T7 promoter allowed expression in Escherichia coli, representing the first mammalian cystathionine gamma-lyase overproduced in a bacterial system. About 90% of the heterologous gene product was insoluble, and renaturation experiments from purified inclusion bodies met with limited success. About 5 mg/liter culture of human cystathionine gamma-lyase could also be extracted from the soluble lysis fraction, employing a three-step native procedure. While the enzyme showed high gamma-lyase activity toward L-cystathionine (Km = 0.5 mM, Vmax = 2.5 units/mg) with an optimum pH of 8.2, no residual cystathionine beta-lyase behavior and only marginal reactivity toward L-cystine and L-cysteine were detected. Inhibition studies were performed with the mechanism-based inactivators propargylglycine, trifluoroalanine, and aminoethoxyvinylglycine. Propargylglycine inactivated human cystathionine gamma-lyase much more strongly than trifluoroalanine, in agreement with the enzyme’s preference for C-gamma-S bonds. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine showed slow and tight binding characteristics with a Ki of 10.5 microM, comparable with its effect on cystathionine beta-lyase. The results have important implications for the design of specific inhibitors for transsulfuration components.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase is an unusual enzyme that requires the cofactors heme and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) to catalyze the condensation of homocysteine and serine to generate cystathionine. This transsulfuration reaction represents one of two major cellular routes for detoxification of homocysteine, which is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. While the beta-replacement reaction catalyzed by this enzyme suggests a role for the pyridoxal phosphate, the role of the heme is uncertain. In this study we have examined the effect of changing one of the ligands to the heme on the activity of the enzyme. Binding of carbon monooxide results in the displacement of a thiolate ligand to the ferrous heme, and is accompanied by complete loss of cystathionine beta-synthase activity. Furthermore, inhibition by CO is competitive with respect to homocysteine, providing the first indication that the homocysteine binding site is in the proximity of heme. Binding of both CO and cyanide to ferrous cystathionine beta-synthase occurs in two distinct isotherms and indicates that the hemes are nonequivalent. We have employed fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the bound PLP and its interaction with serine. PLP bound to cystathionine beta-synthase is weakly fluorescent and exists as a mixture of the protonated and unprotonated tautomers. Reaction with hydroxylamine releases the oxime and greatly enhances the associated fluorescence. Binding of serine is accompanied by a shift to the unprotonated tautomer of the external aldimine as well as the appearance of a new fluorescent species at approximately 400 nm that could be due to the aminoacrylate or to a gemdiamine intermediate. These data provide the first characterization of the PLP bound to cystathionine beta-synthase. Treatment of cystathionine beta-synthase with hydroxylamine releases two PLPs after 1 day and results in complete loss of activity. Incubation for an additional 3-4 days results in the release of two more PLPs. These data lead us to revise the PLP stoichiometry to 4 per tetramer, and to the conclusion that the heme and PLP sites in cystathionine beta-synthase are nonequivalent.</p>

<p>The ability of neurons to metabolize sulfur-containing compounds to cysteine was investigated using as indicator the glutathione content in neuron-rich primary cultures derived from the brains of embryonal rats. The-glutathione content of these cultures was doubled during a 4-h incubation in a minimal medium containing cysteine, glutamine and glycine. In contrast, absence of cysteine or replacement of cysteine by methionine or 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate failed to increase the glutathione content of cultured neurons. Besides cysteine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) also caused in the millimolar range, a concentration-dependent increase in the neuronal glutathione content during a 4-h incubation. These data suggest that neurons in culture, contain an acylase activity which allows them to generate from extracellular NAC as precursor intracellular cysteine in concentrations sufficient for glutathione synthesis. In contrast, generation of cysteine from 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate by the reaction of 5-oxoprolinase or from methionine by the transsulfuration pathway appears not to take place in these cultured neurons.</p>

<p>The sulfur-containing amino acid, homocysteine, is formed from the essential amino acid methionine, and a number of B vitamins are involved in methionine metabolism. Pyridoxine, vitamin B6, is a cofactor for cystathionine beta synthase, which mediates the transformation of homocysteine to cystathionine, the initial step in the transsulfuration pathway and the urinary excretion of sulfur. In a normal diet there is conservation of the carbon skeleton, and about 50% of the homocysteine formed is remethylated to methionine via steps that require folic acid and vitamin B12. A deficiency of any of these three vitamins leads to modest homocyst(e)ine elevation, as does diminished renal function, both of which are common in the elderly. It is also established that homocyst(e)ine elevation of this order is associated with increased cardiovascular risk but is also associated with most established risk factors, although it is thought to be an independent contributor. In the inborn error of metabolism homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency there is greatly increased circulating homocyst(e)ine and a clear association with precocious vascular disease. In about 50% of these patients there is a vascular event before the age of 30 years. The homocysteine-induced adverse vascular changes appear to result from endothelial and smooth muscle cell effects and increased thrombogenesis. We have documented a highly significant reduction in the occurrence of vascular events during 539 patient years of treatment in 32 patients with cystathionine beta synthase deficiency (mean age 30 years, range 9-66 years) by aggressive homocyst(e)ine lowering with pyridoxine, folic acid, and B12 (p = 0.0001). The 15 pyridoxine nonresponsive patients also received oral betaine. Although a cause and effect relationship is postulated for the increased cardiovascular risk associated with mild homocysteine elevation, a common cause of this elevation is the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. Homozygotes occur in about 11% of Caucasian populations. However, the mutation is not associated with increased coronary risk. Since mild homocysteine elevation is easily normalized by B vitamin supplementation, usually with folic acid, it remains for controlled clinical trials of this inexpensive therapy to determine whether normalizing mild homocyst(e)ine elevation reduces cardiovascular risk.</p>

<p>The transsulfuration enzyme cystathionine gamma-synthase (CGS) catalyses the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent gamma-replacement of O-succinyl-L-homoserine and L-cysteine, yielding L-cystathionine. The crystal structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme has been solved by molecular replacement with the known structure of cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL), and refined at 1.5 A resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.0%. The enzyme crystallizes as an alpha4 tetramer with the subunits related by non-crystallographic 222 symmetry. The spatial fold of the subunits, with three functionally distinct domains and their quaternary arrangement, is similar to that of CBL. Previously proposed reaction mechanisms for CGS can be checked against the structural model, allowing interpretation of the catalytic and substrate-binding functions of individual active site residues. Enzyme-substrate models pinpoint specific residues responsible for the substrate specificity, in agreement with structural comparisons with CBL. Both steric and electrostatic designs of the active site seem to achieve proper substrate selection and productive orientation. Amino acid sequence and structural alignments of CGS and CBL suggest that differences in the substrate-binding characteristics are responsible for the different reaction chemistries. Because CGS catalyses the only known PLP-dependent replacement reaction at Cgamma of certain amino acids, the results will help in our understanding of the chemical versatility of PLP.</p>

<p>An elevation in the concentration of total plasma homocysteine is known to be an independent risk factor for the development of vascular disease. Alterations in homocysteine metabolism have also been observed clinically in diabetic patients. Patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have signs of renal dysfunction tend to exhibit elevated total plasma homocysteine levels, whereas type 1 diabetic patients who have no clinical signs of renal dysfunction have lower than normal plasma homocysteine levels. The purpose of this study was to investigate homocysteine metabolism in a type 1 diabetic animal model and to examine whether insulin plays a role in its regulation. Diabetes was induced by intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg streptozotocin to Sprague-Dawley rats. We observed a 30% reduction in plasma homocysteine in the untreated diabetic rat. This decrease in homocysteine was prevented when diabetic rats received insulin. Transsulfuration and remethylation enzymes were measured in both the liver and the kidney. We observed an increase in the activities of the hepatic transsulfuration enzymes (cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase) in the untreated diabetic rat. Insulin treatment normalized the activities of these enzymes. The renal activities of these enzymes were unchanged. These results suggest that insulin is involved in the regulation of plasma homocysteine concentrations by affecting the hepatic transsulfuration pathway, which is involved in the catabolism of homocysteine.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase [CBS; l-serine hydro-lyase (adding homocysteine), EC 4.2.1.22] catalyzes the first committed step of transsulfuration and is the enzyme deficient in classical homocystinuria. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and the complete nucleotide sequence of the human CBS gene. We report a total of 28,046 nucleotides of sequence, which, in addition to the CBS gene, contains approximately 5 kb of the 5’ flanking region. The human CBS gene contains 23 exons ranging from 42 to 209 bp. The 5’ UTR is formed by 1 of 5 alternatively used exons and 1 invariably present exon, while the 3’ UTR is encoded by exons 16 and 17. We also describe the identification of two alternatively used promoter regions that are GC rich (approximately 80%) and contain numerous putative binding sites for Sp1, Ap1, Ap2, and c-myb, but lack the classical TATA box. The CBS locus contains an unusually high number of Alu repeats, which may predispose this gene to deleterious rearrangements. Additionally, we report on a number of DNA sequence repeats that are polymorphic in North American and European Caucasians.</p>

<p>Genetic abnormalities in two metabolic steps in homocysteine degradation: transsulfuration and remetylation can cause raised plasma homocysteine concentration. Homocysteine appeared to be an independent arteriosclerotic risk factor in the coronary, cerebral and peripheral circulation and elevated homocysteine levels have been found in chronic renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment and in transplant patients as well. Homocysteine has a direct toxic effect on endothelial cells, reduces normal activation of protein C by endothelial cells, increases the binding of Lp(a) to plasmin-modified fibrin, induces tissue factor procoagulant activity and inhibits the cofactor activity of thrombomodulin. Treatment with folic acid and piridoxine can lower the high level of homocysteine and should be associated with a clinical benefit.</p>

<p>Homocysteine (Hcy) represents a branching point between the transsulfuration and transmethylation pathway of methionine. A large increase of plasma concentration of Hcy is observed in patients with inherited hyperhomocysteinemia. A moderated increase (above 10 microM) is also observed in various pathological conditions, such as arterial occlusion, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and chronic renal failure. While amino acids were largely studied using capillary electrophoresis with UV or laser-induced fluorescence detection (LIF), thiol-amino acids were not. In this work we present a new approach for testing homocysteine in human plasma using CE-LIF and fluorescein isothiocyanate. The low fluorescence yield of the fluorescein thiocarbamyl (FTC) thiol-amino acids limits, probably, the sensitivity of the detection to 8 x 10(-10) M (instead of 10(-12) M for FTC-arginine).</p>

<p>Effects of a single dose of betaine on the chloroform-induced hepatotoxicity were examined in adult male ICR mice. Administration of betaine (1000 mg/kg, ip) 1 to 7 hr prior to a chloroform challenge (0.25 ml/kg, ip) resulted in remarkable enhancement of hepatotoxicity as indicated by increases in serum sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. The potentiation of hepatotoxicity was most significant when mice were treated with betaine 4 hr earlier than chloroform. However, a 24 hr prior administration of betaine protected the animals from induction of the chloroform hepatotoxicity. Thus, its effect appeared to be highly dependent on the time lapse from the betaine pretreatment to the challenge of mice with chloroform. Betaine treated either 4 or 24 hr prior to sacrifice did not alter the hepatic contents of cytochrome P-450, cytochrome b5, or NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase activity. Accordingly the hepatic microsomal p-nitroanisole O-demethylase, aminopyrine N-demethylase, or p-nitrophenol hydroxylase activities were not influenced by the betaine pretreatment. Betaine was shown not to affect any of the enzyme activities associated with glutathione (GSH) conjugation reaction, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), glutathione disulfide (GSSG) reductase and GSH peroxidase irrespective of the time of its administration. When betaine was administered to mice 2-6 hr prior to sacrifice, hepatic GSH level, but not plasma GSH, was decreased significantly. Enhancement of the chloroform hepatotoxicity by betaine correlated well with the reduction in hepatic GSH levels. Both hepatic and plasma GSH levels were elevated in mice 24 hr following the betaine treatment. The results suggest that betaine affects induction of the chloroform hepatotoxicity by modulating the availability of hepatic GSH, which appears to be associated with its role in the transsulfuration pathway in the liver.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine and serine to cystathionine-an irreversible step in the eukaryotic transsulfuration pathway. The native enzyme is a homotetramer or multimer of 63-kDa (551 amino acids) subunits and is activated by S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) or by partial cleavage with trypsin. Amino-terminal analysis of the early products of trypsinolysis demonstrated that the first cleavages occur at Lys 30, 36, and 39. The enzyme still retains the subunit organization as a tetramer or multimer composed of 58-kDa subunits. Analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry showed that further trypsin treatment cleaves CBS in its COOH-terminal region at Arg 413 to yield 45-kDa subunits. This 45-kDa active core is the portion of CBS most conserved with the evolutionarily related enzymes isolated from plants, yeast, and bacteria. The active core of CBS forms a dimer of approximately 85 kDa. The dimer is about twice as active as the tetramer. It binds both pyridoxal 5’-phosphate and heme cofactors but is no longer activated by AdoMet. Further analysis suggests that the dissociation of CBS to dimers causes a decrease in enzyme thermostability and a threefold increase in affinity toward the sulfhydryl-containing substrate-homocysteine. We found that the COOH-terminal region, residues 414-551, is essential for maintaining the tetrameric structure and AdoMet activation of the enzyme. The inability of the active core to form multimeric aggregates has facilitated its crystallization and X-ray diffraction studies.</p>

<p>A Candida glabrata cadmium-sensitive mutant partially defective in glutathione production and exhibiting a complete absence of phytochelatins was used to clone a gene required for Cd tolerance. Transformation of the Cd-sensitive mutant with a genomic library from the wild-type C. glabrata led to the cloning of a gene that restored Cd tolerance and formation of Cd-glutathione and Cd-phytochelatin complexes. The cloned gene showed high levels of nucleic acid and protein sequence homology to the HEM2 genes, encoding porphobilinogen synthases, from several sources. It was shown that the C, glabrata Cd-sensitive mutant indeed exhibited a significant reduction in porphobilinogen synthase levels. The cloned C. glabrata gene complemented a hem2 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and restored porphobilinogen synthase activity in the mutant. The Cd sensitive mutant predictably showed decreased levels of sulfite reductase that requires siroheme, a metabolite produced in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The addition of cysteine, but not methionine, increased glutathione levels and Cd tolerance of both the wild-type and the mutant strain. However, addition of hemin chloride and methionine together restored Cd tolerance indicating that heme was required for transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine.</p>

<p>Moderate elevation of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a strong and independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). It can result from genetic or nutrient-related disturbances in the transsulfuration or remethylation pathways for Hcy metabolism. A point mutation (C677T; Ala-to-Val) in the gene encoding the 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has been recently reported to render the enzyme thermolabile and less active. Studies on the role of this mutation as a risk factor for CAD have given conflicting results. We studied a total of 415 subjects, 278 with angiographically documented multivessel CAD and 137 with angiographically documented normal coronary arteries. The overall frequency of the MTHFR V/V homozygous genotype was 15.7% (with 52.5% heterozygous and 31.8% normal). Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between CAD and CAD-free subjects. A genotype/phenotype correlation study showed a marked effect of folate on the association between MTHFR genotypes and tHcy. Among individuals with folate levels below the median (11.5 nmol/L), fasting tHcy was significantly increased not only in V/V homozygotes (by 59%) but also, at intermediate values, in A/V heterozygotes (by 21% on average). Conversely, the mutation resulted neutral with respect to tHcy levels in subjects with adequate folate levels. We conclude that, in our population, the MTHFR C677T mutation is rather common, but it does not appear to be associated per se to CAD. A genetic-environmental interaction may contribute to the vascular risk by elevating tHcy when folate status is low.</p>

<p>Two pathways, the methionine cycle and transsulfuration, account for virtually all methionine metabolism in mammals. Every tissue possesses the methionine cycle. Therefore, each can synthesize AdoMet, employ it for transmethylation, hydrolyze AdoHcy, and remethylate homocysteine. Transsulfuration, which occurs only in liver, kidney, small intestine and pancreas, is the means for catabolizing homocysteine. Liver has a unique isoenzyme of MAT that allows the utilization of excess methionine for the continued synthesis of AdoMet. Metabolic regulation is based on the distribution of available homocysteine between remethylation and conversion to cystathionine. The tissue content of the enzymes and their inherent kinetic properties provide the basis for the regulatory mechanism. The effector properties of the metabolites AdoMet, AdoHcy and methylTHF are of particular relevance.</p>

<p>Alcohol feeding to rats that were submitted to a jejunoileal bypass operation has been shown to result in liver damage being comparable with alcohol-induced liver disease in man. In the present study, a striking effect of free methionine consumption on histological liver injury, triglyceride accumulation, and energy-rich nucleoside content in the liver of rats with a jejunoileal bypass is demonstrated. The animals obtained 0, 30, and 120 mg of methionine in the control group and 0, 30, 120, and 240 mg in the alcohol-fed group per day and per kilogram of body weight for 12 weeks. Methionine was found to strongly improve the alcohol-induced histological changes in the liver. Triglyceride content of the liver was found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner with increasing methionine ingestion (from 255 +/- 20.7 to 49.7 +/- 6.1 micromol/g of protein in the control group and from 233 +/- 17.3 to 42.1 +/- 7.2 micromol/g of protein in the alcohol group). Hepatic adenosine triphosphate content increased significantly with higher methionine consumption (13.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 26.9 +/- 2.8 micromol/g of protein in the control group and 11.9 +/- 1.4 vs. 20.5 +/- 2.5 micromol/g of protein in the alcohol group), whereas no differences were found in the protein and DNA content of the liver. These results underscore the impairment of the transmethylation/transsulfuration pathway in the development of alcohol-induced liver diseases.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the irreversible, serine-dependent conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine via a transsulfuration pathway. CBS deficiency not only is the leading cause of homocystinuria, an inherited genetic disorder, but may contribute to cardiovascular disease as well. We isolated three new isoforms of human CBS mRNA from a human liver cDNA library. We designate these CBS mRNAs as CBS 3, CBS 4, and CBS 5, and the CBS mRNAs reported previously by Kraus et al. (1993) (Hum. Mol. Genet. 2, 1933-1938) and Kruger and Cox (1994) (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 6614-6618) as CBS 1 and CBS 2, respectively. Sequence analyses show that the only difference among the five CBS mRNAs is at the beginning of the 5’-untranslated region. Tissue distribution studies reveal that liver and pancreas have the highest amounts of CBS mRNAs. CBS mRNA is present in all regions of the brain tested. We also report the differential distribution of CBS mRNA isoforms in tissues, showing that pancreas contains all five CBS isoforms and the liver has four CBS mRNA isoforms, CBS 1-4. The kidney contains only CBS 1 and CBS 2. In human fetal tissues, CBS 2 is present in the liver and kidney. PCR-based quantitative analyses of CBS mRNA isoforms in human liver demonstrate that CBS 1 and CBS 2 are the major species, with CBS 2 being more abundant, while CBS 3-5 are the minor species. Furthermore, results from our human liver cDNA screening and primer extension experiments show that each of the five CBS transcripts begins with a different exon, suggesting that CBS gene transcription might be regulated by more than one promoter.</p>

<p>A gene library of the Leptospira meyeri serovar semaranga strain Veldrat S.173 DNA has been constructed in a mobilizable cosmid with inserts of up to 40 kb. It was demonstrated that a Leptospira DNA fragment carrying metY complemented Escherichia coli strains carrying mutations in metB. The latter gene encodes cystathionine gamma-synthase, an enzyme which catalyzes the second step of the methionine biosynthetic pathway. The metY gene is 1,304 bp long and encodes a 443-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 45 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Leptospira metY product has a high degree of similarity to those of O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases from Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A lower degree of sequence similarity was also found with bacterial cystathionine gamma-synthase. The L. meyeri metY gene was overexpressed under the control of the T7 promoter. MetY exhibits an O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase activity. Genetic, enzymatic, and physiological studies reveal that the transsulfuration pathway via cystathionine does not exist in L. meyeri, in contrast to the situation found for fungi and some bacteria. Our results indicate, therefore, that the L. meyeri MetY enzyme is able to perform direct sulfhydrylation for methionine biosynthesis by using O-acetylhomoserine as a substrate.</p>

<p>A moderate elevation of plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and arterial and veinous thrombosis. However, the mechanisms leading to vascular disorders are poorly understood because studies that have investigated the potential atherothrombogenicity of hyperhomocysteinemia in vivo are scarce. Using a rat model, we were the first to show that dietary folic acid deficiency, a major cause of basal hyperhomocysteinemia, is associated with enhanced macrophage-derived tissue factor and platelet activities. We proposed that an homocysteine-induced oxidative stress may account for this hypercoagulable state. To determine the true thrombogenicity of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia and better understand its etiology, we have carried out an acute methionine load in control and folate-deficient animals. When rats were fed the control diet, a transient fourfold increase in plasma homocysteine levels was observed 2 h after the methionine administration. As with prolonged dietary folic acid deficiency, this methionine load potentiated the platelet aggregation in response to thrombin and ADP as well as the thrombin-induced thromboxane synthesis. It also stimulated the basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced tissue factor activity of peritoneal macrophages. These prothrombotic effects were associated with an increased lipid peroxidation characterized by an elevation of plasma conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. When rats were fed a folic acid-deficient diet, the methionine load did not cause any further increase in plasma homocysteine concentration, platelet activation, macrophage tissue factor-dependent coagulation, or lipoperoxidation. Altogether, our data showed that the prethrombotic state due to both the altered remethylation and transsulfuration pathways resulted from the moderate elevation of circulating homocysteine. We conclude that moderate hyperhomocysteinemia plays a role in the development of a thrombogenic state that might be mediated by the occurrence of oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by homocystinuria and multisystemic clinical disorders. The term denotes a biochemical abnormality of methionine metabolism caused both by transsulfuration pathway disorders and remethylation of homocysteine into methionine, and as such it can be a result of numerous specific and different genetic lesions. Homocystinuria is most commonly caused by deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity (EC 4.2.1.22). In this lesion, depending on specific characteristics of mutant enzyme molecules, in regard to existence of residual activity, responsive and nonresponsive homocystinuria can be differed regarding clinical response to high doses of pyridoxine. Although there are numerous different clinical abnormalities, changes on four organ systems are dominant. The most common symptoms of homocystinuria include lens dislocation, vascular disorders, skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. Laboratory findings are the first diagnostic procedure, while determination of enzymatic activity is a direct parameter for making diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis and early detection are extremely important for the course and prognosis of the disease as they enable application of currently available therapy as soon as possible. The presently available therapy can, only in such cases, prevent occurrence of serious clinical symptoms, prevent their advancement to some extent or improve reversible clinical manifestations.</p>

<p>Glutathione is essential for cellular cytoprotection, and in the exocrine pancreas, it is required for digestive enzyme synthesis. The purpose of these studies was to measure the capacity of the exocrine pancreas to synthesize glutathione, determine whether the pancreatic transsulfuration pathway has a role in providing cysteine needed for glutathione synthesis, and determine whether the glutathione synthetic capacity of the pancreas responds to pathologically relevant stresses. The activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the key regulatory enzyme for glutathione synthesis, was 3.56 +/- 0.29 mU/mg protein in the pancreas of fed rats, compared to 31 +/- 4 in the liver and 116 +/- 5 in the kidney. Studies using dispersed rat pancreatic acinar cells showed that the exocrine pancreas synthesizes glutathione from precursor amino acids and that the transsulfuration pathway is functionally intact in the pancreas and may serve as an important source of pancreatic cysteine. In mice, pancreatic gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was induced 37% by corn oil, 77% by ethanol, and 88% by both treatments. Thus, the glutathione synthetic capacity of the pancreas is quantitatively less than that of the kidney or liver, but its key regulatory enzyme responds dynamically to pathologically relevant metabolic stresses, suggesting that glutathione is a key pancreatic cytoprotectant.</p>

Treatments were abomasal infusion of water only or water plus 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10g/d of L-Met. Steers were fed 2.4 kg/d DM of a diet designed to minimize basal Met supply to the small intestine. Continuous ruminal infusions of VFA (506 g/d) and abomasal infusions of dextrose (150 g/d) increased energy supply to the abomasum. Break-point analysis estimated maximal N retention at 5.8 g/d supplemental L-Met. The basal absorbable Met supply was 2.1 g/d; therefore, the total Met requirement was 7.9 g/d when excess Cys was available. In Exp. 2, five steers (195 kg) were used to determine the efficiency of transsulfuration. Treatments were abomasal infusion of water only or water plus 1.62 or 3.25 g/d L-Cys or 2 o4 g/d L-Met. Diet and infusions were similar to those on Exp. 1, except the amino acid mixture was devoid of Cys and all steers received 4 g/d L-Met to make total sulfur amino acids, but not necessarily Met, limiting. Nitrogen retention increased in response to Met but not Cys infusion and was maximized at 2 g/d supplemental L-Met; thus, the total Met requirement was near 8.4 g/d when the Cys supply was 2.1 g/d. Supplemental Cys did not spare Met, suggesting that nonprotein functions of Met may be quantitatively important.</p>

<p>The recent discovery of N1-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine (ovothiol A), a small aromatic thiol, in Crithidia fasciculata made it possible to study its biosynthesis in an organism which can be cultured in large quantities and under defined growth conditions. Radiolabeling experiments using intact cells indicated that the methyl group in ovothiol A is derived from methionine, while 35S was incorporated from either cysteine or methionine. Three lines of evidence suggested that transsulfuration preceded the methylation step: (a) Crithidia fasciculata failed to convert radiolabeled N pi-methylhistidine to ovothiol A. (b) Ovothiol A was poorly separated from a component which was labeled by [14C]histidine and by [35S]cysteine, but not by [methyl-3H] methionine. (c) Dialysed crude extracts of C. fasciculata catalysed the conversion of histidine to a thiolated species in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, iron and cysteine in the absence of S-adenosylmethionine. The product of the in vitro reaction was isolated as the bimane derivative. Structural analysis using 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy confirmed its identity as the bimane derivative of 4-mercaptohistidine.</p>

<p>We have investigated the disposition of potentially endotoxic homocysteine (Hcy) and its transsulfuration metabolite cysteine (Cys) in 98 individuals (age range 20-66 years). Our study reports on the relationship between Hcy and two important dietary factors likely to influence plasma levels of this thiol: dietary folate and dietary methionine. chi2 analysis shows a low frequency of elevated plasma Hcy at high folate intake. This frequency for Hcy &gt;10 micromol/liter with a folate intake &gt;350 microg/day is significant (P &lt; 0.02). The data reflect a tendency for elevated Hcy values to be associated with low dietary folate, although many subjects with a low dietary folate also had a low plasma Hcy. Intake of dietary methionine was found to be significantly higher in males than in females (P &lt; .0001). This may account for the looser relationship between Hcy and its transsulfuration product, Cys, in females (R2 = 0.30) compared to males (R2 = 0.73), since conversion of methionine to SAM in males would activate cystathionine beta synthase and commit excess Hcy to transsulfuration. The generally lower methionine intake of females means that more Hcy is utilized in the remethylation cycle in which methionine is produced from the de novo methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or from the preformed methyl group of betaine. Clearly a Hcy moiety locked up in remethylation would be further removed from Cys, the end product of transsulfuration. An increasing number of studies are clarifying the relationship between Hcy, folate, and other B vitamins. However, less attention seems to be given to the influence of dietary methionine on the disposition of Hcy. The present study supports biochemical theory and indicates that more focus should be given to the effect of dietary methionine on Hcy. These findings have particular significance since even moderate increases in plasma Hcy are associated with a toxic vascular effect. Consequently the relationship between dietary folate and Hcy levels should be a factor in evaluating recommended dietary allowances for this vitamin. The simplicity of our dietary folate questionnaire also raises the possibility of a screening test in which individuals can ascertain whether their folate intake is adequate to reduce Hcy levels to a benign value.</p>

<p>Homozygotes for homocystinuria due to cystathionine synthase (CS) deficiency accumulate homocysteine and methionine in their blood and tissues. High-dose pyridoxin, folic acid, vitamin B12, or betaine are therapeutical options to lower the elevated homocysteine concentration. These compounds stimulate the transsulfuration or remethylation of homocysteine. Despite such treatment, elevated blood homocysteine concentrations may persist in many homocystinurics. Therefore, it is warranted to study alternative regimen to reduce the blood homocysteine concentration in homocystinurics. Apart from entering the transsulfuration pathway, methionine can be catabolized via the transamination pathway, by conversion into 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate (MTOB), followed by oxidative decarboxylation of MTOB to 3-methylthiopropionate. Thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of thiamine, is a cofactor of the supposed rate-limiting oxidative decarboxylation in the transamination of methionine. The effect of thiamine administered in 2 or 3 daily doses of 25 mg orally, was studied in nine homozygote CS deficient patients. Methionine levels decreased in 6 out of 9 patients. In 8 out of 9 patients, however, the levels of plasma homocysteine remained virtually unchanged, as did the serum transamination metabolites in all patients. We conclude that vitamin B1 cannot be used as an additional homocysteine-lowering treatment in most homozygotes for homocystinuria.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia appears to be an independent risk factor for coronary disease. Elevated levels of plasma total homocysteine (tHCY) can result from genetic or nutrient-related disturbances in the transsulfuration or remethylation pathways for homocysteine metabolism. The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the predominant circulatory form of folate, which serves as a methyl donor for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. A common mutation in MTHFR recently has been identified.METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the polymorphism in MTHFR, plasma tHCY, and folate using baseline blood levels among 293 Physicians’ Health Study participants who developed myocardial infarction (MI) during up to 8 years of follow-up and 290 control subjects. The frequency of the three genotypes was (-/-) (homozygous normal), 47%; (+/-) (heterozygous), 41%; and (+/+) (homozygous mutant), 12%, with a similar distribution among both MI case patients and control subjects. Compared with those with genotype (-/-), the relative risk (RR) of MI among those with (+/-) was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.5), and it was 0.8 (0.5 to 1.4) for the (+/+) genotype; none of these RRs were statistically significant. However, those with genotype (+/+) had an increased mean tHCY level (mean +/- SEM, 12.6 +/- 0.5 nmol/ mL), compared with those with genotype (-/-) (10.6 +/- 0.3) (P &lt; .01). This difference was most marked among men with low folate levels (the lowest quartile distribution of the control subjects): those with genotype (+/+) had tHCY levels of 16.0 +/- 1.1 nmol/mL, compared with 12.3 +/- 0.6 nmol/mL (P &lt; .001) for genotype (-/-).CONCLUSIONS: In this population, MTHFR polymorphism was associated with higher homocysteine levels but not with risk of MI. A gene-environment interaction might increase the risk by elevating tHCY, especially when folate intake is low.</p>

<p>The methionine loading test is used for the diagnosis of impaired methionine/homocysteine metabolism, in particular the transsulfuration pathway. Usually this test is performed on a low protein diet to control the intake of methionine. However, this is inconvenient and relatively expensive. In this study we compared the effects of a low protein diet and a standard diet on methionine loading test in 28 subjects (crossover design). The mean difference in homocysteine concentration after methionine loading between the two diets was 1.3 [confidence interval (CI) 95%-1.0-3.6] mumol/L which demonstrates that a special low protein diet is not essential in the performance of the methionine loading test. We also observed that 3 weeks after the first methionine loading test, fasting serum concentration of folate was higher and vitamin B12 concentration was lower.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) is a member of the gamma-family of PLP-dependent enzymes, that cleaves C beta-S bonds of a broad variety of substrates. The crystal structure of CBL from E. coli has been solved using MIR phases in combination with density modification. The structure has been refined to an R-factor of 15.2% at 1.83 A resolution using synchroton radiation diffraction data. The asymmetric unit of the crystal cell (space group C222(1)) contains two monomers related by 2-fold symmetry. A homotetramer with 222 symmetry is built up by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. Each monomer of CBL can be described in terms of three spatially and functionally different domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 60) consists of three alpha-helices and one beta-strand. It contributes to tetramer formation and is part of the active site of the adjacent subunit. The second domain (residues 61 to 256) harbors PLP and has an alpha/beta-structure with a seven-stranded beta-sheet as the central part. The remaining C-terminal domain (residues 257 to 395), connected by a long alpha-helix to the PLP-binding domain, consists of four helices packed on the solvent-accessible side of an antiparallel four-stranded beta-sheet. The fold of the C-terminal and the PLP-binding domain and the location of the active site are similar to aminotransferases. Most of the residues in the active site are strongly conserved among the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway. Additionally, CBL is homologous to the mal gamma gene product indicating an evolutionary relationship between alpha and gamma-family of PLP-dependent enzymes. The structure of the beta, beta, beta-trifluoroalanine inactivated CBL has been refined at 2.3 A resolution to an R-factor of 16.2%. It suggests that Lys210, the PLP-binding residue, mediates the proton transfer between C alpha and S gamma.</p>

<p>We determined the molecular basis of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency in a partially pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria patient. Direct sequencing of the entire CBS cDNA revealed the presence of a homozygous G1330A transition. This mutation causes an amino acid change from aspartic acid to asparagine (D444N) in the regulatory domain of the protein and abolishes a TaqI restriction site at DNA level. Despite the homozygous mutation, CBS activities in extracts of cultured fibroblasts of this patient were not in the homozygous but in the heterozygous range. Furthermore, we observed no stimulation of CBS activity by S-adenosylmethionine, contrary to a threefold stimulation in control fibroblast extract. The mutation was introduced in an E. coli expression system and CBS activities were measured after addition of different S-adenosylmethionine concentrations (0-200 microM). Again, we observed a defective stimulation of CBS activity by S-adenosylmethionine in the mutated construct, whereas the normal construct showed a threefold stimulation in activity. These data suggest that this D444N mutation interferes in S-adenosylmethionine regulation of CBS. Furthermore, it indicates the importance of S-adenosylmethionine regulation of the transsulfuration pathway in homocysteine homeostasis in humans.</p>

<p>Homocysteine, an atherogenic amino acid, is either remethylated to methionine or metabolized to cysteine by the transsulfuration pathway. The biochemical conversion of homocysteine to cysteine is dependent upon two consecutive, vitamin B-6-dependent reactions. To study the effect of a selective vitamin B-6 deficiency on transsulfuration, we performed oral methionine load tests on 22 vitamin B-6-deficient asthma patients treated with theophylline (a vitamin B-6 antagonist) and 24 age- and sex-matched controls with a normal vitamin B-6 status. Both groups had normal circulating vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations. Methionine loading resulted in significantly higher increases in circulating total homocyst(e)ine (P &lt; 0.01) and cystathionine (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations in vitamin B-6-deficient patients compared with controls. 6 wk of vitamin B-6 supplementation (20 mg/d) significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced post-methionine load increases in circulating total homocyst(e)ine concentrations in deficient subjects, but had no significant effect on the increase in total homocyst(e)ine concentrations in controls. The increases in post-methionine load circulating cystathionine concentrations were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) reduced in both groups after vitamin supplementation. It is concluded that a vitamin B-6 deficiency may contribute to impaired transsulfuration and an abnormal methionine load test, which is associated with premature vascular disease.</p>

<p>Elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine levels are an independent risk factor for vascular disease. In a case-control study, the authors studied the associations of fasting plasma homocyst(e)ine and vitamins, which are important cofactors in homocysteine metabolism, with the risk of myocardial infarction. The cases were 130 Boston area patients hospitalized with a first myocardial infarction and 118 population controls, less than 76 years of age, enrolled in 1982 and 1983. Dietary intakes of vitamins B6, B12, and folate were estimated from a food frequency questionnaire. After adjusting for sex and age, the authors found that the geometric mean plasma homocyst(e)ine level was 11% higher in cases compared with controls (p = 0.006). There was no clear excess of cases with extremely elevated levels. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio for each 3-mumol/liter (approximately 1 standard deviation) increase in plasma homocyst(e)ine was 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.05-1.75; p trend = 0/007). After further control for several risk factors, the odds ratio was not affected, but the confidence interval was wider and the p value for trend was less significant. Dietary and plasma levels of vitamin B6 and folate were lower in cases than in controls, and these vitamins were inversely associated with the risk of myocardial infarction, independently of other potential risk factors. Vitamin B12 showed no clear association with myocardial infarction, although methylmalonic acid levels were significantly higher in cases. Comparing the mean levels of several homocysteine metabolites among cases and controls, the authors found that impairment of remethylation of homocyst(e)ine (dependent of folate and vitamin B12 rather than on vitamin B6-dependent transsulfuration) was the predominant cause of high homocyst(e)ine levels in cases. Accordingly, plasma folate and, to a lesser extent, plasma vitamin B12, but not vitamin B6, correlated inversely with plasma homocyst(e)ine, even for concentrations at the high end of normal values. These data provide further evidence that plasma homocyst(e)ine is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction. In this population, folate was the most important determinant of plasma homocyst(e)ine, even in subjects with apparently adequate nutritional status of this vitamin.</p>

<p>Two separate metabolic pathways that methylate homocysteine to methionine are known in humans, utilizing, respectively, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and betaine as methyl donors. Deficiency of the folate-dependent methylation system is linked to hyperhomocysteinemia. Our data suggest that this deficiency leads to concurrent metabolic down-regulation of homocysteine transsulfuration that may contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia. By contrast, no instances have been reported of hyperhomocysteinemia resulting from deficiencies of betaine-dependent homocysteine methylation. Long-term betaine supplementation of 10 patients, who had pyridoxine-resistant homocystinuria and gross hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase activity, caused a substantial lowering of plasma homocysteine, which has now been maintained for periods of up to 13 years. Betaine had to be taken regularly because the effect soon disappeared when treatment was stopped. In conclusion, depressed activity of the transsulfuration pathway may contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia because of primary deficiencies of enzymes of either the transsulfuration or of the folate-dependent methylation pathways. Stimulation of betaine-dependent homocysteine remethylation causes a commensurate decrease in plasma homocysteine that can be maintained as long as betaine is taken.</p>

<p>Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide (gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine), is thought to be both a storage and a transport form of cysteine (Cys). In a previous study (T. Hiramatsu, N.K. Fukagawa, J.S. Marchini, J. Cortiella, Y.-M. Yu, T.E. Chapman, and V.R. Young. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 60: 525-533, 1994), the direct tracer-derived estimate of Cys flux was considerably higher than that predicted from estimates of protein turnover. To further examine the components of plasma Cys flux, seven normal-weight healthy adult men and women (26 +/- 2 yr) received stable isotope tracer infusions of L-[methyl-2H3;1-13C]methionine, L-[3,3-2H2]cysteine, and L-[methyl-2H3]leucine for 460 min. After a 3-h baseline period, GSH was administered at approximately 32 mumol.kg-1.h-1 until the end of the study. Expired breath and blood samples were obtained at timed intervals and analyzed for isotope enrichment using mass spectrometry. Leucine, alpha-ketoisocaproate, and methionine (carboxyl carbon, methyl moiety, remethylation, and transsulfuration) turnover were reduced during GSH administration (P &lt; 0.01). In the final hour of GSH administration, Cys flux increased by 61% from 55.1 +/- 1.7 to 88.7 +/- 5.2 mumol.kg-1.h-1 (P &lt; 0.01), which was essentially equivalent to the rate of exogenous GSH infusion. These data suggest that GSH breakdown accounts for approximately 50% of tracer-derived Cys flux basally and for all of the increase in measured Cys turnover during exogenous GSH infusion.</p>

<p>Serum homocysteine concentrations have been shown to be a sensitive functional indicator of intracellular folate, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6 status. Chronic alcoholism is known to interfere with one-carbon metabolism, for which the above vitamins serve as coenzymes. In the present study, these vitamins were assessed in 32 chronic alcoholics and 31 healthy volunteers by measuring blood vitamin concentrations as well as serum homocysteine concentrations. In chronic alcoholics, serum pyridoxal 5’-phosphate and red blood cell folate concentrations were significantly lower than in the control subjects (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively). Mean serum homocysteine was twice as high in chronic alcoholics than in nondrinkers (P &lt; 0.001). Beer consumers had significantly lower concentrations of homocysteine compared with drinkers of wine or spirits (P = 0.05). These results suggest that by interfering with folate or vitamin B-6 metabolism, chronic alcohol intake may impair the disposal of homocysteine through the transmethylation or transsulfuration pathways.</p>

<p>AIMS: An impaired methionine degradation along the transsulfuration pathway has been widely described in cirrhosis. Evidence has been provided that methionine can also be degraded via a transamination pathway, leading to formation of methanethiol and its metabolites, protein-S-SCH3 (a mixed disulphide of blood proteins and methanethiol), alpha-ketomethylthiobutyrate and X-S-SCH3 (a mixed disulphide of a thiol with an unknown component X and methanethiol). This pathway seems to be of little importance in normal subjects, even after methionine loading, but its role in the presence of an acquired transsulfuration defect has never been tested.METHODS: We measured the plasma concentration of methanethiol metabolites in six normal subjects and 11 patients with cirrhosis receiving a primed-continuous infusion of L-methionine, at rates able to increase plasma methionine to levels approximately 20 times basal concentrations.RESULTS: Before methionine infusion, the sum of transamination metabolites was similar in the two groups (0.29 +/- SD 0.07 mumol/l in controls and 0.45 +/- SD 0.22 in patients with cirrhosis). During methionine infusion and after the end of infusion, there was a progressive increase of transamination metabolites, which reached values approximately 10 times basal concentrations, with no difference between groups.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that transamination cannot represent a quantitatively important exit for excess methionine in subjects with cirrhosis, in the presence of an acquired block along the transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from 3-mercaptopyruvate to several possible acceptor molecules, one of which is cyanide. Because the transsulfuration of cyanide is the primary in vivo mechanism of detoxification, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase may function in the enzymatic detoxification of cyanide in vivo. Three alpha-keto acids (alpha-ketobutyrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and pyruvate) have previously been demonstrated to be cyanide antidotes in vivo, and it has been suggested that this is due to the nonenzymatic binding of cyanide by the alpha-keto acid. However, it has also been proposed that alpha-keto acids may increase the activity of enzymes involved in the transsulfuration of cyanide. Thus, the effect of these three alpha-keto acids on the enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase was examined. All three alpha-keto acids inhibited 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in a concentration-dependent manner and were determined to be uncompetitive inhibitors of MST with respect to 3-mercaptopyruvate. The inhibitor constant Ki was estimated by two methods for each inhibitor and ranged from 4.3 to 6.3 mM. The I50, which is the inhibitor concentration that produces 50% inhibition, was calculated for all three alpha-keto acids and ranged between 9.5 and 13.7 mM. These observations add further support to the hypothesis that the mechanism of the alpha-keto acid antidotes is the nonenzymatic binding of cyanide, not stimulation of enzymes involved in the transsulfuration of cyanide to thiocyanate.</p>

<p>We measured fasting total plasma homocysteine (Hcy) in 10 chronic hemodialysis (HD) and 10 chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Mean (+/- SEM) Hcy was 55.7 +/- 10.1 and 50.5 +/- 14.3 mumol/l, respectively (normal range 6-19 mumol/l). Hemodialysis treatment lowered Hcy by about 30%. Daytime Hcy concentrations were stable in the PD patients. Six weeks of treatment with folic acid (FA) significantly lowered Hcy in HD and PD patients to 24.0 +/- 1.8 and 21.0 +/- 3.6 mumol/l, respectively. After withdrawal, Hcy rose slowly, in parallel with the gradually decreasing plasma FA concentrations, which were greatly elevated during treatment. Chronic treatment with FA of another group of patients showed a similar effect on Hcy. Preliminary results of oral methionine loading in chronic dialysis patients were compatible with delayed homocysteine metabolism via the transsulfuration pathway. Further studies on the optimal treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in chronic dialysis patients are needed.</p>

<p>Taurine and hypotaurine seem to be important compounds for sperm survival and capacitation, the fertilisation process and embryo development, and are present in both sperm and genital secretions. Hypotaurine has protective effects against peroxidative damage. We have established a simple method for hypotaurine quantification in sperm and genital secretions. The mean concentration of hypotaurine is significantly higher in bovine than in human spermatozoa and in seminal plasma. We observed that both molecules are secreted by cow, sow, goat and rabbit oviduct epithelial cell monolayers. In rabbit the release is ascorbic acid dependent. Goat oviduct epithelial cells are able to use the transsulfuration pathway to form hypotaurine and taurine from methionine. We were able to identify cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.29) activity in cow and goat tubal monolayers. Our results demonstrate that hypotaurine and taurine are secreted by oviduct epithelium, and synthesised by tubal cells via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway. The data obtained emphasise the importance of hypotaurine and taurine for gamete maturation, fertilisation and early embryonic development.</p>

<p>This study shows that the intracellular concentration of homocysteine in cultured cells is kept low due to an accumulation in the medium. The intracellular level of homocysteine was decreased when its precursor, methionine, was omitted from the culture medium. Intracellular glutathione and cysteine were lowered in cystine-deficient medium. Intracellular glutathione was also lowered when copper ions were added to the culture medium. It is evident from this study that the intracellular concentration of homocysteine was not influenced by the lowered level of glutathione and/or cysteine. High amounts of homocysteine added to the medium give rise to an increase of intracellular reduced homocysteine, which participates in the transsulfuration pathway and can replace cysteine in the synthesis of glutathione. The addition of relatively high amounts of reduced homocysteine (500 mumol/l) in the presence of copper ions (100 mumol/l) to the culture medium can be directly toxic to the cells, possibly due to oxygen radicals formed by thiol auto-oxidation. Whilst the level of homocysteine in this study using short-time cell culture experiment is much higher than the mild hyperhomocysteinemia thought to be atherogenic in humans, it is conceivable that over a longer time course these levels of homocysteine could be sufficient to induce endothelial dysfunction, eventually leading to atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is a key enzyme in transmethylation, transsulfuration, and the biosynthesis of polyamines. Genetic deficiency of alpha/beta-MAT causes isolated persistent hypermethioninemia and, in some cases, unusual breath odor or neural demyelination. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this deficiency has not been clearly defined. In this study, we characterized the human alpha/beta-MAT transcription unit and identified several mutations in the gene of patients with enzymatically confirmed diagnosis of MAT deficiency. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays demonstrated that these mutations partially inactivate MAT activity. These results establish the molecular basis of this disorder and allow for the development of DNA-based methodologies to investigate and diagnose hypermethioninemic individuals suspected of having abnormalities at this locus.</p>

<p>The methylation and transsulfuration pathways are intimately linked and have been implicated in the progression of neurologic damage and immune cell depletion caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We studied the following metabolites related to these pathways: S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinyl-glycine, and glutathione (GSH) in blood and CSF of 16 HIV-infected patients with neurologic complications and 20 HIV-negative control patients undergoing lumbar punctures for other medical reasons. We confirmed recent studies of decreased CSF SAMe concentrations in HIV infection and demonstrated that diastereomers of SAMe are present in CSF but not in plasma or erythrocytes from both HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients. In HIV-infected patients, CSF GSH and cysteinyl-glycine, but not homocysteine or cysteine, were significantly reduced. This is the first report of decreased CSF GSH induced by HIV infection. GSH has a regulatory effect on the synthesis of SAMe in hepatic tissue, and the same mechanism may also apply in the CNS. Administration of SAMe-butanedisulphonate, 800 mg/d intravenously for 14 days, was associated with significant increases in CSF SAMe and GSH. These findings have potentially important therapeutic implications for the use of SAMe in protecting against SAMe and GSH deficiency in the CNS of HIV-infected patients.</p>

<p>Deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a genetic disorder of transsulfuration resulting in elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and methionine and decreased cysteine. Affected patients have multisystem involvement, which may include light skin and hair. Reversible hypopigmentation in treated homocystinuric patients has been infrequently reported, and the mechanism is undefined. Two CBS-deficient homocystinuric patients manifested darkening of their hypopigmented hair following treatment that decreased plasma homocyst(e)ine. We hypothesized that homocyst(e)ine inhibits tyrosinase, the major pigment enzyme. The activity of tyrosinase extracted from pigmented human melanoma cells (MNT-1) that were grown in the presence of homocysteine was reduced in comparison to that extracted from cells grown without homocysteine. Copper sulfate restored homocyst(e)ine-inhibited tyrosinase activity when added to the culture cell media at a proportion of 1.25 mol of copper sulfate per 1 mol of DL-homocysteine. Holo-tyrosinase activity was inhibited by adding DL-homocysteine to the assay reaction mixture, and the addition of copper sulfate to the reaction mixture prevented this inhibition. Other tested compounds, L-cystine and betaine did not affect tyrosinase activity. Our data suggest that reversible hypopigmentation in homocystinuria is the result of tyrosinase inhibition by homocyst(e)ine and that the probable mechanism of this inhibition is the interaction of homocyst(e)ine with copper at the active site of tyrosinase.</p>

<p>Methionine is converted by the transmethylation/transsulfuration pathway to homocysteine which may exert atherogenic effects by several mechanisms, including lipid peroxidation. Therefore, the excessive dietary methionine may induce the development of atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, plasma and aortic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as activities of aortic and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were measured in rabbits fed a diet enriched with 0.3% methionine for 6 or 9 months. Histological examinations of aortas also were performed. Feeding rabbits a methionine-enriched diet for 6 or 9 months resulted in significant increases in plasma and aortic TBARS levels and aortic antioxidant enzyme activities. However, a decrease in plasma antioxidant activity (AOA) was observed. In erythrocytes, SOD activity increased, catalase remained normal and GPX decreased in the treated animals. Histological examination of aortas showed typical atherosclerotic changes, such as intimal thickening, deposition of cholesterol, and calcification in methionine-fed rabbits. These results confirm that high-methionine diet may induce atherosclerosis in rabbits and indicate disturbances in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant processes as possible mechanisms of its atherogenic influence.</p>

<p>There are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether L-cysteine is an essential amino acid in premature infants as the result of the absence of hepatic cystathionase activity. To analyze the physiological importance of the cystathionase deficiency, we studied sulfur amino acid metabolism in human neonates of different gestational ages. Plasma cystathionine concentrations are higher in premature infants &lt; or = 32 wk gestation (group 1) than in premature infants of 33-36 wk gestational age (group 2) or in full-term infants (group 3), whereas plasma cysteine concentrations are much lower in group 1 and 2 premature infants than in mature infants. Furthermore, erythrocytes from group 1 premature infants synthetize glutathione from L-methionine (a process dependent on the cystathionase pathway) at a much lower rate than do erythrocytes from group 2 premature or full-term infants. Thus, the metabolic flow through the transsulfuration pathway may be insufficient to meet the glutathione and cysteine requirements of very premature infants.</p>

<p>Based on a review of the Penicillium chrysogenum biochemistry a stoichiometric model has been set up. The model considers 61 internal fluxes and there are 49 intracellular metabolites which are assumed to be in pseudo-steady state. In addition to the intracellular fluxes the model considers the uptake of 21 amino acids. From the stoichiometric model the maximum theoretical yield of penicillin V is calculated to 0.43 mol/mol glucose. If biosynthesis of cysteine is by direct sulfhydrylation rather than by transsulfuration, the maximum theoretical yield is about 20% higher, i.e., 0.50 mol/mol glucose. The theoretical yield decreases substantially if alpha-aminoadipate is converted to 6-oxo-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid (OPC). If only 40% of the alpha-aminoadipate is recycled, the maximum theoretical yield is 0.31 mol/mol glucose. The uptake rates of glucose, lactate, gamma-aminobutyrate, and 21 amino acids were measured during fed-batch cultivations. The rates of formation of penicillin V, delta-(L-alpha)-aminoadipyl-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV), OPC, and the pool of isopenicillin N, 6-APA, and 8-HPA were also measured. Finally the synthesis rates of the biomass constituents RNA/DNA, protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and amino carbohydrate were measured. From these measured rates and the stoichiometric model the metabolic fluxes through the different intracellular pathways are calculated. The calculations show that penicillin formation is accompanied by a large flux through the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway due to a large requirement for nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) used in the biosynthesis of cysteine. If cysteine is added to the medium, the flux through the PP pathway decreases. From the stoichiometric model Y(xATP) is calculated to 87 mmol adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/g dry weight (DW), and from the flux calculations m(ATP) is found to 3 mmol ATP/g DW/h.

<p>The relationship between genes and enzymes in the methionine biosynthetic pathway has been studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The first step is catalysed by an O-succinylhomoserine synthase, the product of the metA gene mapped at 20 min on the chromosome. The second step is achieved by direct sulfhydrylation, involving the enzyme encoded by a metZ gene that we have identified and sequenced, located at 40 min. Thus Pseudomonas appears to be the only organism so far described that uses O-succinylhomoserine as substrate for a direct sulfhydrylation. As in yeast, the two transsulfuration pathways between cysteine and homocysteine, with cystathionine as an intermediate, probably exist in parallel in this organism.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-lyase, the second enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway leading to homocysteine synthesis was purified over 16,000-fold from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaf chloroplasts (soluble fraction). Enzyme activity was followed along the purification scheme by either a colorimetric method for the determination of cysteine or by fluorescence detection of the bimane derivative of L-homocysteine after reverse-phase HPLC. Cystathionine beta-lyase has a molecular mass of 170,000 +/- 5000 Da and consists of four identical subunits of 44,000 Da. The enzyme exhibits an absorption spectrum in the visible range with a maximum at 418 nm due to pyridoxal 5’-phosphate. The chloroplastic enzyme catalyzes alpha,beta-cleavage of the thioether L-cystathionine and the dithioacetal L-djenkolate with apparent Km values of 0.15 and 0.34 mM, respectively, and apparent Vm values corresponding to a specific activity of 13 Units mg-1. However, no activity was detected toward the disulfide L-cysteine. With either L-cystathionine and L-djenkolate as substrate, maximal activity was obtained between pH 8.3 and pH 9.0. Besides the chloroplastic enzyme form, anion exchange chromatography of a total spinach leaf extract allowed the detection of a second pool of cystathionine beta-lyase activity that is associated with the cytosolic compartment and eluted at a lower salt concentration than the chloroplastic isoform. Kinetics of inactivation of cystathionine beta-lyase by the L-alpha-(2-aminoethoxyvinyl) glycine (AVG), an analogue of L-cystathionine, are consistent with the existence of an intermediate reversible enzyme inhibitor complex (apparent inhibition constant Kappi of 110 microM) preceding the irreversible formation of a final inactivated state of the enzyme (kd = 4.8 x 10(-3) s-1). Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate free in solution binds AVG with an apparent dissociation constant Kapp in the order of 350 microM. The comparison between the Kapp (free pyridoxal 5’-phosphate) and Kappi (enzyme inactivation) values indicate that the prosthetic group of spinach chloroplast cystathionine beta-lyase is freely accessible to the inhibitor compound AVG.</p>

<p>Cystathionine gamma-synthase, the first enzyme specific for the methionine biosynthetic pathway, was purified to apparent homogeneity from spinach leaf chloroplasts. A nonradioactive assay based on O-phthaldialdehyde derivatization of L-cystathionine and fluorescence detection was developed to determine the cystathionine gamma-synthase activity. A unique cystathionine gamma-synthase activity was located in the stromal fraction of chloroplasts while cystathionine beta-lyase, the second enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway, was associated with both the chloroplastic and cytosolic compartments (see companion manuscript). The purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 13 U mg-1. As estimated by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under nondenaturing conditions followed by activity staining, the native enzyme had an apparent M(r) of 215,000. On the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, purified cystathionine gamma-synthase migrated as two molecular species of M(r) 53,000 and 50,000 that are identical in their N-termini. The absorption spectrum obtained at pH 7.5 exhibited a peak at 425 nm due to pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). The purified enzyme catalyzed the formation of L-cystathionine or L-homocysteine depending on the sulfur-containing substrate, L-cysteine or sulfide. Maximal cystathionine gamma-synthase activity was found at pH 7.4. The apparent Km values for O-phospho-L-homoserine (the unique homoserine ester synthesized in the chloroplast), L-cysteine, and sulfide were 1.4, 0.18, and 0.6 mM, respectively. Inactivation of cystathionine gamma-synthase by DL-propargylglycine (PAG) showed pseudo-first-order kinetics and data were consistent with the existence of an intermediate reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (Kappi = 140 microM) preceding the formation of a final enzyme-inhibitor complex (kd = 24 x 10(-3) s-1). The irreversibility of the inhibition and the partial restoration of the activity by pyridoxal-phosphate suggest that PAG interacts with the PLP prosthetic group of the enzyme. Kinetic and equilibrium binding studies showed that PAG binding to PLP was considerably enhanced in the enzyme binding pocket compared to that with PLP free in solution.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease complicated by early and aggressive occlusive arterial disease. This may be related to the grossly increased homocysteine concentrations seen in this disease. More recently, milder hyperhomocysteinemia has been proposed as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease.SUMMARY: Many patients with homozygous homocystinuria develop severe premature atherosclerosis and thromboembolism, probably caused by abnormally high concentrations of homocysteine. Homocysteine undergoes metabolism either by remethylation or transsulfuration, and deficiency or dysfunction of any of the substances that regulate these reactions may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine may have adverse effects on platelets, clotting factors, and endothelial cells. Studies have demonstrated significantly higher plasma homocysteine levels in patients with occlusive arterial disease than in controls. The causes are not clearly understood but may include deficiency of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid and heterozygosity for cystathionine synthase deficiency. Vitamin supplementation can lower plasma homocysteine levels.CONCLUSIONS: Whether measuring plasma homocysteine levels in patients with coronary artery disease should be routine and whether treating hyperhomocysteinemia in these patients may reduce the risk of coronary events remains to be determined.</p>

<p>The first committed step of transsulfuration is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a known pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) enzyme. The inferred amino acid sequences of rat liver CBS and rat liver hemoprotein H-450 are identical. We now confirm the presence of heme b in rat and human liver CBS. Heme almost entirely accounts for the visible spectrum of CBS rather than PLP. Human CBS, expressed in Escherichia coli, acquires heme b from the host bacteria. delta-Aminolevulinate supplementation during bacterial growth increases both the heme saturation and the specific activity of the homogeneous enzyme more than 3-fold. 1 mol of the 63-kDa CBS subunit binds 1 mol of each (heme and PLP). The presence of heme is required for PLP binding, and the amount of PLP bound is limited by the heme content. Removal of PLP, but not heme, from CBS is reversible. These findings suggest that heme is functionally incorporated into CBS only during protein folding. This report describes the first instance of an enzyme that depends upon both heme and PLP for its function.</p>

Similar to Enterobacteriaceae, S. pombe lacks cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase-the enzymes of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, by which methionine is readily metabolized to cysteine-a likely effector in the sulfur metabolite repression system.

<p>The cysteine, cystine, methionine and sulfate uptake and cysteine metabolism of Giardia lamblia was studied. Initial experiments indicated that bathocuproine sulphonate (20 microM) added to Keister’s modified TYI-S-33 medium supported the growth of G. lamblia at low L-cysteine concentration. This allowed the use of high specific activity radiolabeled L-cysteine for further studies. The analyses of L-cysteine uptake by G. lamblia indicate the presence of at least two different transport systems. The total cysteine uptake was non saturable, with a capacity of 3.7 pmoles per 10(6) cells per min per microM of cysteine, and probably represent passive diffusion. However, cysteine transport was partially inhibited by L-methionine, D-cysteine and DL-homocysteine, indicating that another system specific for SH-containing amino acids is also present. Cysteine uptake was markedly decreased in medium without serum. In contrast to cysteine, the uptake of L-methionine and sulfate were carried out by saturable systems with apparent Km of 71 and 72 microM, respectively, but the Vmax of the uptake of sulfate was six orders of magnitude lower than the Vmax of methionine uptake. Cystine was not incorporated into trophozoites. [35S]-labeled L-cysteine and L-methionine, but not [35S]sulfate, were incorporated into Giardia proteins, indicating that the parasite lacks the capacity to synthesize cysteine or methionine from sulfate. Neither cystathionine gamma lyase nor cystathionine gamma synthase activities was detected in homogenates of Giardia lamblia, suggesting that the transsulfuration pathway is not active and there is no conversion of methionine to cysteine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p>

<p>Interest in total plasma homocysteine (homocyst[e]ine) as a risk factor for atherosclerosis is expanding. However, the origin of plasma homocyst(e)ine has not been defined. Our studies examined the metabolism of homocyst(e)ine by blood cells as a potential contributor to the homeostasis of homocyst(e)inemia. Incubation of blood for 24 hours at 37 degrees C produced a threefold increase in the level of plasma homocyst(e)ine. In samples of fractionated blood cells incubated in vitro, increases in total plasma homocysteine were limited to incubated erythrocyte fractions and were influenced by addition of methionine. Anticoagulants had no significant effect. Incubation of blood in the presence of methionine tagged with sulfur 35 demonstrated incorporation of label into homocysteine and transsulfuration products. Similar incubations of blood cell fractions suggested that synthesis of homocysteine occurred in erythrocytes, whereas leukocytes both synthesized and transsulfurated homocysteine. These findings demonstrated a possible interaction of different blood cells in the metabolism of methionine, as well as their potential role as a source of total plasma homocysteine in plasma.</p>

<p>The transsulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of homocysteine and cysteine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine. The various organisms studied up to now incorporate reduced sulfur into a three- or a four-carbon chain and use differently the transsulfuration pathways to synthesize sulfur amino acids. In enteric bacteria, the synthesis of cysteine is the first step of organic sulfur metabolism and homocysteine is derived from cysteine. Fungi are capable of incorporating reduced sulfur into a four-carbon chain, and they possess two operating transsulfuration pathways. By contrast, synthesis of cysteine from homocysteine is the only existing transsulfuration pathway in mammals. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genetic, phenotypic, and enzymatic study of mutants has allowed us to demonstrate that homocysteine is the first sulfur amino acid to be synthesized and cysteine is derived only from homocysteine (H. Cherest and Y. Surdin-Kerjan, Genetics 130:51-58, 1992). We report here the cloning of genes STR4 and STR1, encoding cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase, respectively. The only phenotypic consequence of the inactivation of STR1 or STR4 is cysteine auxotrophy. The sequencing of gene STR4 has allowed us to compare all of the known sequences of transsulfuration enzymes and enzymes catalyzing the incorporation of reduced sulfur in carbon chains. These comparisons reveal a partition into two families based on sequence motifs. This partition mainly correlates with similarities in the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes.</p>

<p>Mice homozygous for chromosomal deletions at or around the albino locus on chromosome 7 express reduced levels of a group of liver genes. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic clones encoding one of the affected genes, the mouse adult liver S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of AdoMet, which functions in transmethylation and transsulfuration. Mouse AdoMet synthetase cDNA is 3232 base pairs (bp) in length and contains an open reading frame that encodes an enzymatically active polypeptide of 396 amino acids. The mouse AdoMet synthetase shares 98 and 96% amino acid sequence identity with the adult liver enzyme in the rat and human, respectively. AdoMet synthetases possess the consensus ATP-binding motif Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly and a putative ATP-binding Lys residue at conserved locations. As an initial step toward understanding the control of AdoMet synthetase gene expression, we characterized the complete transcription unit of this gene. The AdoMet synthetase gene spans approximately 18 kilobases and consists of nine exons ranging from 78 to 1920 bp. The transcription initiation site was demonstrated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and confirmed by primer extension studies. A putative TATA box is located at -28 to -23 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The cis-acting DNA elements in the 5’-flanking region of the AdoMet synthetase gene that drive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression in mouse hepatocytes were identified by transient expression assays. The -365 to -2-bp DNA region upstream of the transcription start site of the AdoMet synthetase gene contains promoter elements, and the -518 to -366-bp DNA region might be involved in negative gene regulation.</p>

<p>Because glutathione (GSH) is an important antioxidant, we hypothesized that changes in lung and systemic availability of GSH and its precursor amino acid, cysteine, are induced by exposure to hyperoxia and that these changes could be modulated by toxic O2 metabolites. In organs and plasma of mice exposed to hyperoxia, we measured GSH and sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs), the latter by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In relatively O2-resistant Swiss-Webster mice, lung GSH increased during O2 exposure, whereas liver GSH (the major storage pool of cysteine) and liver and plasma cysteine all decreased. Pair-feeding studies suggested that nutritional deprivation alone did not cause the decrease in plasma cysteine. In lung, SAAs were not decreased by O2 exposure. In fact, cystathionine increased sixfold, and gamma-cystathionase was not inhibited. These findings suggest that hyperoxia increases transsulfuration pathway activity and that cystathionase rate limits this process in lung. In comparative studies, lung GSH increased in O2-resistant high-CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD) transgenic mice but not in genetically similar, nontransgenic controls (CBYB/6 x B6D/2) during hyperoxic exposure. In addition, liver GSH and plasma cysteine decreased in nontransgenic control but not in high-SOD mice, whereas lung cystathionine increased similarly in both groups. Thus, superoxide or its secondary products can modulate, at least in part, the changes in cysteine and GSH. Nonetheless, regardless of strain or SOD status, hyperoxic exposure consistently caused thiol and SAA changes, including increased lung cystathionine and oxidized GSH, demonstrating a strong association between these dynamic changes and oxidant stress.</p>

<p>Rats were fed toxic levels of methionine with or without simultaneous dietary supplements of glycine and serine. Feed intake, growth rate, and metabolite concentrations in intestine, plasma, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidneys were monitored. Both toxic amounts of methionine and supplemental glycine and serine affected the tissue distribution of several amino acids resulting in similar, opposite, and diet-specific effects on the parameters studied. These changes were considered to be normal responses of amino acid metabolism to diet and to reflect metabolite flows between tissues. The feeding of toxic levels of methionine resulted in the accumulation of methionine, taurine, and glutathione in all tissues measured, but caused marked accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine and its catabolites only in liver. Hepatic accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine was accompanied by 40% stimulation of methionine adenosyltransferase and 40% repression of spermine synthase over a 2-week period. Simultaneous dietary supplements of glycine and serine combined with toxic levels of methionine markedly stimulated hepatic methionine catabolism. As a result, tissue distribution of methionine and glutathione returned close to normal in all tissues measured and accumulation of hepatic S-adenosylmethionine and its catabolites was prevented. Concentrations of taurine in liver, blood, and kidneys were further elevated, suggesting increased conversion of methionine to taurine followed by urinary excretion. These changes were accompanied by normalization of the above enzyme activities and the absence of symptoms of methionine toxicity. It was concluded that methionine toxicity is likely to be linked to hepatic accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine, resulting in liver dysfunction probably due to nonenzymatic methylation of liver macromolecules. Accumulation of tissue glutathione may also contribute to toxicity.</p>

<p>The metabolism of selenite, selenocysteine (SeCys), and selenomethionine (SeMet) was studied in three human lymphoblast cell lines with defects in the transsulfuration pathway and in control cells without this defect. There were very little differences in the induction of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity by selenite and SeCys among these cells. However, markedly higher levels of SeMet were required to induce GPX activity in transsulfuration defective cells than in control cells. Surprisingly, the addition of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) to the media resulted in elevated GPX activity in all cells regardless of the chemical form of Se used. There is no explanation for this effect of PLP, but it is not through direct reaction with GPX or on the alteration of sulfhydryl groups.</p>

<p>We have studied the transamination pathway (3-mercaptopyruvate pathway) ofL-cysteine metabolism in rats. Characterization of cysteine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.3) from liver indicated that the transamination, the first reaction of this pathway, was catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1). 3-Mercaptopyruvate, the product of the transamination, may be metabolized through two routes. The initial reactions of these routes are reduction and transsulfuration, and the final metabolites are 3-mercaptolactate-cysteine mixed disulfide [S-(2-hydroxy-2-carboxyethylthio)cysteine, HCETC] and inorganic sulfate, respectively. The study using anti-lactate dehydrogenase antiserum proved that the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 3-mercaptopyruvate was lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). Formation of HCETC was shown to depend on low 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.2) activity. Results were discussed in relation to HCETC excretion in normal human subjects and patients with 3-mercaptolactate-cysteine disulfiduria. Incubation of liver mitochondria withL-cysteine, 2-oxoglutarate and glutathione resulted in the formation of sulfate and thiosulfate, indicating that thiosulfate was formed by transsulfuration of 3-mercaptopyruvate and finally metabolized to sulfate.</p>

<p>Several inherited metabolic disorders of the transsulfuration pathway are discussed. They are hypermethioninemia, homocystinuria, cystathioninuria, beta-mercaptolactate cysteine disulfideuria and sulfite oxidase deficiency (SOD). Primary coverage is given to homocystinuria and SOD. In the case of homocystinuria, metabolic defects include cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, methylenetetrahydroforate reductase deficiency, and mutations in cobalamin metabolism. Their main clinical pictures, metabolic abnormalities, and treatment are also described. SOD appears in two cases as an isolated enzyme defect and a combined deficiency of sulfite oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase that share a common molybdenum cofactor. The clinical, biochemical and neurological features of the two disorders are reviewed.</p>

<p>A block in the transsulfuration pathway has previously been suggested in cirrhosis on the basis of increased fasting methionine concentrations, decreased methionine elimination and low levels of methionine end products. To date, methionine elimination has never been studied under controlled steady-state conditions, and the relation of the severity of liver disease to impaired methionine metabolism has not been clarified. We measured methionine plasma clearance in 6 control subjects and in 12 patients with cirrhosis during steady-state conditions obtained by a primed, continuous methionine infusion. In the presence of high-normal fasting methionine concentrations (range = 14 to 69 mumol.L-1 in controls and 26 to 151 mumol.L-1 in cirrhotic patients), methionine plasma clearance was reduced in cirrhotic patients (2.25 +/- S.D. 0.43 ml.sec-1 vs. 2.86 +/- S.D. 0.43 ml.sec-1 in controls; p less than 0.05), whereas methionine half-life was increased (282 +/- 90 min vs. 187 +/- 25 min in controls; p less than 0.05). Fasting methionine significantly correlated with methionine clearance. The infused methionine was not degraded to urea to any significant extent in cirrhotic patients, whereas a threefold increase in urinary urea nitrogen excretion rate was observed in controls. Similarly, taurine concentrations significantly increased both in plasma and in the urine in controls but not in cirrhotic patients. In cirrhotic patients methionine plasma clearance significantly correlated with galactose elimination capacity (r = 0.818) and with the Child-Pugh score (rs = -0.795). The study supports a major role of impaired liver cell function in the reduced metabolism of methionine and decreased formation of methionine end products that occur in cirrhosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p>

<p>Exogenous administration of testosterone produced several metabolic tissue-specific changes in female mouse kidneys, but not in the liver. The hormone induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, and also profoundly influenced metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Therefore, the activity of the AdoMet-synthesizing enzyme (AdoMet synthetase) and of cystathionine synthase, which commits homocysteine irreversibly to the transsulfuration pathway, were significantly increased. In contrast to the level of AdoMet in the liver the renal level of this metabolite was augmented, whereas the level of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) did not change. This resulted in an increase of the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio. In testosterone-treated mice, pulse-labelled with [methyl-14C]methionine, the radioactivity recovered in the kidneys doubled, but in the liver remained the same. The rise in radioactivity recovered occurred mainly in TCA-soluble compounds and lipids, and to a smaller extent, in proteins and nucleic acids.</p>

<p>We have identified a mutation in a gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, STR1, that leads to a strict nutritional requirement for cysteine. The str1-1 mutation decreases to an undetectable level the cystathionine gamma-lyase activity. This enzyme catalyzes one of the two reactions involved in the transsulfuration pathway that yields cysteine from homocysteine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine. The phenotype induced by this mutation implies that, in S. cerevisiae, the sulfur atom of sulfide resulting from the reductive assimilation of sulfate is incorporated into a four carbon backbone yielding homocysteine, which, in turn, is the precursor of the biosynthesis of both cysteine and methionine. This also reveals that the direct synthesis of cysteine by incorporation of the sulfur atom into a three carbon backbone as found in Escherichia coli does not occur in S. cerevisiae. The study of the meiotic progeny of diploid strains heterozygous at the STR1 locus has shown that the str1-1 mutation undergoes a particularly high frequency of meiotic gene conversion.</p>

<p>A unified, biochemical hypothesis is proposed to explain the pathogenesis of homocysteinemia. This hypothesis is based on the existence of coordinate regulation by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) of the partitioning of homocysteine between de novo methionine synthesis and catabolism through cystathionine synthesis. This coordination, which serves to modulate the cellular concentration of homocysteine based on the requirements for methionine, is impaired in homocysteinemia. This hypothesis is evaluated in the context of the conditions known to be associated with homocysteinemia, including enzymatic defects and vitamin deficiencies. The novelty of the hypothesis is the assertion that impairment of one homocysteine metabolic pathway must lead to the impairment of the other homocysteine metabolic pathway to cause homocysteinemia. This extends the simplistic view that a block of only one of the pathways is sufficient to cause homocysteinemia.</p>

<p>Mixed disulfides of methanethiol represent a relative estimate for an exposure to methanethiol. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides, methionine, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and ammonia were measured in patients with different stages of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with chronic kidney failure and in healthy subjects. In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, the mean serum concentrations of all these compounds were elevated. However, the elevations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were small and partly caused by decreased renal function. In addition, the levels of methanethiol-mixed disulfides did not differ significantly between the different grades of hepatic encephalopathy. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were substantially lower than those previously observed in healthy subjects after an oral methionine load or in a patient with a deficiency in methionine adenosyltransferase, the latter without causing encephalopathy. We concluded that the role of methanethiol in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is probably minor, if not insignificant. In the patients with hepatic encephalopathy, a significant correlation was found between the concentrations of methionine and 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and between 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and methanethiol-mixed disulfides, supporting the theory that methanethiol is formed by way of the methionine transamination pathway. Evidence is provided that, besides the methionine transsulfuration pathway, the transamination pathway is also impaired in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.</p>

<p>Arterial and venous thromboembolic events represent frequent and life-threatening complications in homocystinuric patients and are responsible for their early deaths. Reduced levels of antithrombin III activity in homocystinuric patients have recently been reported. So, high plasma L-homocysteine concentration could play a role in the low antithrombin III activity level. In the present study, we have studied the relationship between total plasma homocysteine and inhibitors of blood coagulation levels in 16 patients with malignancies who received bone marrow grafts. There were no correlations between homocysteine values and inhibitors of blood coagulation levels. So, while the defect in amino acid transsulfuration that is responsible for homocystinuria can directly affect the synthesis or activity of some clotting factors, homocysteine concentration is not responsible for this effect.</p>

<p>Early onset vascular disease unexplained until today by usual risk factors (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, tobacco, stress), can now find an explanation in sulfur amino acid metabolism defect. By transsulfuration, alimentary methionine leads to homocysteine, which is itself turn into cysteine, or remethylated into methionine. Several abnormalities of these different pathways lead to plasma accumulation of homocysteine, which will be responsible of arterial or venous occlusive lesions, concerning peripheral or deep vessels. Homocysteine stays in plasma upon several forms: 75% being linked by disulfide bounds to proteins, 22% as disulfide, homocystine (homocysteine-homocysteine) or mixed-disulfide (homocysteine-cysteine), and less than 3% as free reduced homocysteine. Plasma reduction allows total homocysteine evaluation with amino acid autoanalyzer. The basal plasma homocysteine level is less than 14 microMl. However, levels near this basal value can be found in patients with latent abnormality, which needs to be revealed by a methionine loading test. This study concerns two methodologies and their application to the exploration of a patient with unidentified neurologic disorders. The first one describes a new galenic oral form of methionine. Other authors use the methionine load of 100 mg/kg dissolving it in a fruit juice glass. In order to obtain a complete dissolution of this weakly soluble substance and to ensure its total absorbtion by the patient, we prepare a granular form aimed to give in water a perfect flavoured suspension. The second methodology concerns methionine loading test and amino acid analysis. After 10 hours fasting, a 100 mg/kg peroral methionine load is realized performing 5 EDTA blood samples before and 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after loading.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p>

The animals were killed 20 min, 1 hr, or 2 hr after the isotope injection and the specific radioactivity of adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as well as the total acid-soluble radioactivity was analyzed in the liver and skeletal muscle. Met concentrations of the liver and skeletal muscle were increased 20-fold by the diet containing 1.50% of Met. In the liver, but not in skeletal muscle, accumulation of AdoMet closely followed changes in Met concentration. Within 2 hr after intraperitoneal injection, the rate of disappearance of 3H label from the acid-soluble fraction was slow in both tissues; increasing in the liver and decreasing in skeletal muscle with increasing dietary Met concentration. At the same time, disappearance of 14C label was slow in both tissues in the rats fed the toxic Met diet, and also in the liver of the rats fed the Met-deficient diet. Decline of the specific radioactivity of the AdoMet pool with respect to 3H label was similar to that of 14C label in the skeletal muscle at all dietary Met concentrations. In the liver, the rate of disappearance of 14C label from the AdoMet pool was markedly increased and that of the 3H label slightly decreased with increasing dietary Met supply. Met deprivation resulted in rapid disappearance of 3H label from the hepatic AdoMet pool, whereas the disappearance of the 14C label was very slow. The results indicate that hepatic Met recycling is very effective with deficient or adequate dietary Met concentrations. In skeletal muscle, the capacity to catabolize extra Met is very limited and continuous flow of Met to liver takes place. Unlike in the liver, in skeletal muscle the transsulfuration route is not adaptable to changes in Met supply and plays a minor role in Met catabolism. The approach used to determine the efficacy and adaptation of methionine salvage pathways by following simultaneously the decline of the specific radioactivities of the methyl group and the methionyl carbon chain of AdoMet following intraperitoneal injection of double-labeled Met has several advantages over that used in literature reports. It offers a reliable means of observing these metabolic pathways in whole animals without disruption of metabolite fluxes.</p>

<p>The effect on copper status of diets containing homocysteine, an intermediate in the transsulfuration pathway of methionine metabolism, was investigated in rats. Two groups of six male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were provided with deionized water and pair-fed diets that were adequate (14.0 mg/kg) or deficient (1.3 mg/kg) in Cu to groups fed diets similarly adequate or deficient in Cu but containing DL-homocysteine (10 g/kg). Hemoglobin concentration, tissue Cu levels and the activities of the Cu-dependent enzymes–ceruloplasmin, superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c oxidase–were markedly lowered by Cu-deficient diets and by homocysteine. These dietary treatments also lowered the activity of glutathione peroxidase and produced concomitant increases in the activity of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase and iron levels in the liver. However, dietary homocysteine decreased hepatic Mn and low Cu diets decreased cardiac iron content. Moreover, both dietary treatments significantly lowered kidney Fe levels. Homocysteine increased heart, liver and kidney weights (g/100 g body tissue) and greatly elevated the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in heart tissue. These results indicate that dietary homocysteine can markedly lower Cu status in rats and result in tissue redistribution of Fe and increased cardiac levels of TBARS, a measure of lipid peroxidation.</p>

<p>To assess the extent to which low hepatic gamma-cystathionase levels affect methionine flux to cysteine in hepatocytes, the effect of inhibition of gamma-cystathionase activity with propargylglycine on the metabolism of L-[35S]methionine was determined in studies with freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. gamma-Cystathionase activity was inhibited 25%, 42%, 63% and 76% (maximal inhibition) by treatment with 2.5 mumol/L, 0.01 mmol/L, 0.02 mmol/L and 2 mmol/l propargylglycine, respectively. Inhibition of gamma-cystathionase activity with up to 0.02 mmol/L propargylglycine had no statistically significant effect on [35S]glutathione, [35S]sulfate or [35S]cysteine formation from [35S]methionine. However, treatment of cells with 2 mmol/L propargylglycine markedly inhibited the metabolism of [35S]methionine to [35S]glutathione by 93%, to [35S]sulfate by 88% and to [35S]cysteine by 89%; [35S]cystathionine accumulation in these incubation systems was 60 times control. Hepatic gamma-cystathionase activity in premature infants has been reported to be about 23% of mature levels (Zlotkin and Anderson, 1982; Pediatr. Res. 16: 65-68); this level of gamma-cystathionase activity may limit cysteine synthesis by the methionine transsulfuration pathway. No evidence for cysteine synthesis from serine and sulfide, which can be catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase, or for methionine metabolism by an S-adenosylmethionine-independent pathway was obtained.</p>

<p>Methionine (Met) conservation in healthy young adult men (4/diet group) was explored by supplying one of the following three L-amino acid based diets: 1) adequate Met but no cystine; 2) neither Met nor cystine; or 3) no Met but cystine supplementation. After 5 days, subjects received a continuous intravenous infusion of L-[1-13C; methyl-2H3]Met for 5 h while the diet was given as small isocaloric isonitrogenous meals. Estimates were made of rates of Met incorporation into protein synthesis (S) and release from body proteins (B), transmethylation (TM), remethylation of homocysteine (RM), and transsulfuration (TS). For the adequate Met diet, the rates were S = 24 +/- 2, B = 18 +/- 1, TM = 12.4 +/- 1.7, RM = 4.7 +/- 1.1, and TS = 7.6 +/- 0.6 (SE) mumol.kg-1.h-1. The sulfur amino acid-devoid diet significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced S, TM, RM, and TS. Supplementation of this diet with cystine reduced Met oxidation (P = 0.05). Therefore, two loci are quantitatively important regulatory points in Met conservation in vivo: 1) the distribution of Met between the pathways of protein anabolism and TM (Met locus) and 2) the distribution of homocysteine between RM and TS (homocysteine locus).</p>

<p>Excess homocysteine in body fluids has been implicated as a factor in the pathogenesis of occlusive vascular disease (peripheral and cerebrovascular arterial disease, and perhaps coronary artery disease). Heterozygotes for inborn errors of homocysteine metabolism (transsulfuration or remethylation pathways) are much more frequent than are homozygotes/compounds. If heterozygotes are at increased risk (a question not addressed here), it is of interest to know whether they can be identified consistently by a “screening” measurement of blood homocyst(e)ine. We used hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (cystathioninemia beta-synthase deficiency) as a test case. From reviews of metabolite values in blood samples either fasting (11 articles) or after a methionine load (8 articles), and of measures of enzyme activity (12 articles), it is apparent that (1) The heterozygous phenotype cannot be identified consistently by any single measure (there is overlap with normal values); and (2) the exaggerated gene dosage effect (negative allelic complementation) present in most heterozygotes does not assist their classification. The failure of enzyme assay to distinguish heterozygotes consistently (relative to normal values) may reflect allelic heterogeneity. The failure of metabolic values to identify heterozygotes consistently reflects the local and global properties of the homeostatic system controlling the homocysteine pool size. The problem described here is a particular example of a general one in physiological and medical genetics, namely detection of heterozygotes for recessive alleles, affecting metabolic homeostasis, for purposes of medical intervention and for genetic counselling.</p>

<p>The content of plasma thiols was determined in 42 patients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Total thiols were evaluated by Ellman’s method, glutathione and cysteine by HPLC in fluorescence. Cirrhotic patients showed a significant decrease in plasma thiol content with respect to a control group of 32 healthy subjects, as total sulphydryls as well as glutathione and cysteine. The thiol decrease does not seem to be related to nutritional status or dietetic factors. Our data indicate that liver cirrhosis, independently from alcohol abuse, produces a decrease in all plasma thiols, probably secondary to a complex alteration of the transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>Supplementation of the diet with valine or isoleucine protects the fruit bat from neurological impairment associated with experimentally induced vitamin B12 deficiency. Valine and isoleucine are precursors in the vitamin B12 dependent propionic acid pathway and it is proposed that they exert their protective effect through stimulation of this pathway. This suggests that the previously observed protective effect of methionine may be mediated also through this pathway, since methionine may be metabolised via the transsulfuration pathway to propionyl CoA. The results of this study refocus attention on the propionic acid pathway, and specifically on the methylmalonyl CoA mutase reaction, as central to the biochemical basis of the vitamin B12 neuropathy.</p>

<p>S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) proved to be effective in antagonizing bile secretion impairment induced by a wide range of hepatotoxins, including ethynylestradiol, taurolithocholate, chlorpromazine and alpha-naphthyl-isothiocyanate. The anticholestatic activity of SAMe may result from its role in the intermediate metabolism as this molecule is involved in transmethylation and transsulfuration reactions. Clinical experience, carried-out on more than 1,000 cholestatic patients, supports preclinical data. In particular, controlled clinical trials have documented that intravenous SAMe (800 mg/day) induced a significant decrease of biochemical parameters of cholestasis (serum total and conjugated bilirubin, serum total bile salts, and aminotransferases), as well as a significant improvement of pruritus in women with ICP compared with placebo. In addition, other studies provided the evidence that both parenteral (800 mg/day) and oral SAMe (1600 mg/day) significantly improves subjective (pruritus, fatigue, and general discomfort) and objective (serum total and conjugated bilirubin, and serum alkaline phosphatase) parameters of cholestasis in patients with intrahepatic cholestasis complicating chronic liver diseases compared with placebo. In all these trials, SAMe treatment has been well tolerated at the same extent as placebo. In conclusion, experimental and clinical investigations indicate that SAMe represents an effective and safe approach to the management of intrahepatic cholestasis.</p>

<p>Biosynthesis of cysteine from methionine via the hepatic transsulfuration pathway is impaired in some cirrhotic patients, who therefore might require cysteine in the diet. However, because further metabolism of cysteine also occurs primarily in the liver, the metabolic clearance of this amino acid could be impaired in cirrhosis. We administered oral loads of L-cysteine to cirrhotic patients and healthy volunteers. Plasma cyst(e)ine (free and protein-bound cysteine, and 1/2 cystine) and urinary sulfur-containing constituents were measured at various times postload. Cirrhotic subjects exhibited a greater maximal plasma cyst(e)ine concentration and plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) and a delayed excretion of metabolic end products after an oral L-cysteine load. The postload increase in total plasma cyst(e)ine was accounted for primarily by an increase in the disulfide form (cystine). These studies show that cirrhotics have an impaired ability to clear cyst(e)ine from the plasma.</p>

With the use of methyl-14C- and uniformly 14C-labeled MTP, it was found that methanethiol and CO2 are reaction products. The methyl carbon was not significantly oxidized. This study, together with a recent report [P. W. D. Scislowski et al. (1987) Biochem.

<p>The addition of L-cysteine to hepatic cytosols causes inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase. We have studied the mechanism of inactivation and the effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the rat on the inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase in the presence of fractions prepared from livers and kidneys. Diabetes increased the rate at which tyrosine aminotransferase was inactivated after addition of cysteine to hepatic cytosols. The inactivation was due to the production of thiocysteine (which contains sulfane sulfur) from cystine as a result of desulfuration catalyzed by gamma-cystathionase. Diabetes increased the content of cystathionine beta-synthase and gamma-cystathionase in liver. As a result, cytosols from diabetic animals converted homocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine and cystine to sulfane at an elevated rate, with resulting inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase. In contrast, inactivation in kidney fractions was not affected by diabetes. Incubation with an inhibitor of gamma-cystathionase (propargylglycine) prevented inactivation of tyrosine aminotransferase. These results show that the potential for the formation of sulfane sulfur by the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway is enhanced by chronic diabetes.</p>

<p>Methionine is supposed to be degraded via two known routes, the transsulfuration and the transamination pathways. In particular, patients with hypermethioninemia, due to a defect in the transsulfuration pathway, may catabolize significant amounts of methionine via the transamination pathway. In this study the relative amount of methionine degraded via the transamination pathway in 17 patients with homozygous homocystinuria, due to cystathionine synthase deficiency, was compared with 23 normal subjects, and with a patient with hypermethioninemia due to a deficiency in methionine adenosyltransferase. The homocystinuric patients and the normal subjects were studied in the fasting state as well as after methionine loading (0.1 g/kg body weight). It is concluded that in cystathionine synthase deficient patients, the transamination pathway is not quantitatively important in methionine degradation despite elevated methionine levels. This is in contrast to the patient with methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, who catabolizes at least 20% of his dietary methionine via the transamination pathway.</p>

<p>Few studies have dealt with blood-clotting changes in patients affected by homocystinuria. The aim of this contribution is to briefly review studies published so far on the topic and report the results of our investigation performed in 3 patients. At baseline we found reduced antithrombin III and factor VII levels in all the patients, in line with the results of other authors, and other slight and less constant changes such as lowered factor X activity and protein C antigen, and increased beta-thromboglobulin levels. During pyridoxine and folate treatment, antithrombin III activity rapidly returned to normal; factor VII increased and beta-thromboglobulin decreased. These blood-clotting abnormalities may play a role in the thrombotic tendency associated with homocystinuria. Their nature is still uncertain, but the improvement observed during active metabolic treatment suggests that the defect in amino acid transsulfuration of homocystinuria may directly affect synthesis or activity of some clotting factors.</p>

<p>Sulfur amino acids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic vascular disease, and observations of patients with several inborn errors of metabolism have led to the ‘homocysteine theory of arteriosclerosis’. Homocysteine is an intermediate in the transsulfuration pathway and it enters into several other reactions, some of which involve transfer of methyl groups. An abnormally high concentration of homocysteine in the blood causes homocystinuria. Deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase is the most frequent cause of homocystinuria. Patients with this disorder are at risk for early vascular occlusions. Treatment with vitamin B6 of patients who are biochemically responsive to this vitamin reduces the risk of thromboembolism. Clinical or pathologic evidence of early vascular disease has also been provided in patients with homocysteinemia due to deficient (re)methylation of homocysteine to methionine. This may be caused by a deficiency of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or by a deficient synthesis of cobalamins.</p>

<p>Kinetic aspects of body methionine (MET) metabolism were examined in healthy young men during the fed and postabsorptive (PA) states. Rates of MET incorporation (S) into and release (B) from body proteins; transmethylation (TM); and remethylation (RM) and transsulfuration (TS) of homocysteine (HCY) were estimated with the aid of a 5-h constant intravenous infusion of [methyl-2H3]- and [1-13C]methionine. The isotopic data (plasma methionine labeling and 13C enrichment of expired air) were submitted to a stochastic model of amino acid metabolism. During the fed state, the subjects (n = 4) received, at 20-min intervals, small isonitrogenous isocaloric meals containing a complete L-amino acid mixture supplying MET at a rate equivalent to 198 mumol.kg body wt-1.day-1. The PA subjects (n = 4) received the isotope after a 10-h overnight fast. For the PA group, the components of MET metabolism were as follows: S, 20 +/- 0.5; B, 24 +/- 0.5; TM, 5.8 +/- 0.6; RM, 1.8 +/- 0.4; and TS, 4.0 +/- 0.4 (+/-SE) mumol.kg-1.h-1. During the fed state the values were S, 26 +/- 2.5; B, 18 +/- 2; TM, 14 +/- 1.3; RM, 5.7 +/- 0.9; and TS 8.3 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg-1.h-1. The meal-induced changes in B, TM, RM, and TS were significant (P less than 0.05). Comparison of the partitioning of MET between S and TM (these two pathways of MET disposal constitute the “methionine locus”) in the PA and in the fed states indicates that the MET locus is of regulatory importance in MET homeostasis. A twofold increase in the partitioning of MET to TM was observed in the fed state. The increase in HCY recycling, relative to TS (these two pathways of HCY disposal constitute the “HCY locus”), in the fed state did not reach statistical significance when compared with the PA state. Total daily TM are estimated to be 238 +/- 22 mumol/kg. This is similar to the estimate generated by the methyl balance model of Mudd and Poole (Metabolism 24: 721, 1975) which approximated 241 mumol/kg.</p>

<p>The effects on cultured baby hamster kidney cells of 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane, a potent new inhibitor of mammalian ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases and of spermidine synthase, were studied. At 0.5 mM concentration in the culture medium, the drug did not interfere with the transmethylation-transsulfuration pathway nor with the polyamine transport system, but it blocked the proliferation and macromolecule synthesis of the cells and reduced the cellular spermidine level to less than 10% of the control value at identical cell density. These changes were accompanied by a total cessation of the excretion of putrescine, spermidine, and acetylated polyamines into the culture medium, greatly increased activity of ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases, and an accumulation of both decarboxylated and intact S-adenosylmethionine. These effects were reversed by the removal of the inhibitor from the culture medium or by supplementing the medium with either 0.5 mM putrescine or 0.1 mM spermidine. In the former case, however, a lag period of 24 h was necessary for the cells to recover. The elevated concentration of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine normalized very slowly but apparently had no harmful effects on the cells. The clonigenic potential of the cells was only slightly reduced by prolonged treatment with 0.5 mM 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane. Thus, the new drug is not toxic to the cells, but either directly or indirectly stops their proliferation by preventing the adequate formation of putrescine and spermidine.</p>

<p>Cystathioninuria is a frequent and highly specific marker of neuroblastoma, but the etiology of this abnormality has not been well studied. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed 27 human neuroblastoma tissue specimens for the presence of cystathionine synthase and cystathionase. Levels of cystathionine synthase varied from undetectable to 622 pmol/mg protein, but no specimen had cystathionase measurable by rocket radioimmunoassay or catalytic assay. In addition, we assayed neuroblastoma cell lines exposed to a variety of differentiating agents: butyric acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, serum-free medium, or sodium citrate to induce differentiation. In each case we were unable to demonstrate cystathionase induction. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that neuroblastomas have a biochemical block in the transsulfuration enzymes at the level of cystathionase and that expression of cystathionine synthase in the absence of cystathionase may account for the presence of cystathioninuria in patients with neuroblastoma.</p>

<p>We investigated sulfur and methyl group metabolism in a 31-yr-old man with partial hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) deficiency. The patient’s cultured fibroblasts and erythrocytes had normal MAT activity. Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was slightly decreased. This clinically normal individual lives with a 20-30-fold elevation of plasma methionine (0.72 mM). He excretes in his urine methionine and L-methionine-d-sulfoxide (2.7 mmol/d), a mixed disulfide of methanethiol and a thiol bound to an unidentified group X, which we abbreviate CH3S-SX (2.1 mmol/d), and smaller quantities of 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and 3-methylthiopropionate. His breath contains 17-fold normal concentrations of dimethylsulfide. He converts only 6-7 mmol/d of methionine sulfur to inorganic sulfate. This abnormally low rate is due not to a decreased flux through the primarily defective enzyme, MAT, since SAM is produced at an essentially normal rate of 18 mmol/d, but rather to a rate of homocysteine methylation which is abnormally high in the face of the very elevated methionine concentrations demonstrated in this patient. These findings support the view that SAM (which is marginally low in this patient) is an important regulator that helps to determine the partitioning of homocysteine between degradation via cystathionine and conservation by reformation of methionine. In addition, these studies demonstrate that the methionine transamination pathway operates in the presence of an elevated body load of that amino acid in human beings, but is not sufficient to maintain methionine levels in a normal range.</p>

<p>Capacity to incorporate methionine sulfur into glutathione as well as cystathionase activity were lost in cultured hepatocytes in a biphasic manner with 75% of the total capacity disappearing with a half-life of about 10.6 hr, the remainder with a half-life of greater than 20 hr. Nicotinamide, 25 mM, produced a single phase loss with a t 1/2 of approximately 21 hr for both transsulfuration and cystathionase activity. Loss of both methionine sulfur incorporation and cystathionase activity occurred in transferrin/sodium selenite-supplemented Williams Medium E (TS-HWME) with a t 1/2 of about 96 hr through 72 hr in culture. Addition of the cystathionase inhibitor, propargylglycine, blocked glutathione synthesis in TS-HWME cells through 48 hr in culture, while propargylglycine blocked glutathione synthesis only at 4 hr in HWME cultured cells. Further, the accumulation of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was delayed by 48 hr in TS-HWME versus unsupplemented medium. Variation in the transport of sulfur amino acids was also found to occur with culture age. The Km values for cysteine and methionine transport were found to be approximately 150 and 100 microM, respectively, and were unaffected by culture age or the presence of TS-HWME. However, the Vmax for transport of methionine declined from 0.29 to 0.012 nmol/min/mg protein over 48 hr in culture. In TS medium, the Vmax at 48 hr for methionine transport had only decreased to 0.20 nmol/min/mg protein and increased for cysteine transport to 0.17 nmol/min/mg protein. These data suggest that during the redifferentiation of hepatocytes in culture, transsulfuration is regulated by control of the flow of substrate through cystathionase and that cystathionase is regulated by alteration of enzyme activity or content. Variations in the rate of transport of precursor sulfur amino acids are also an important component of the regulation of the net glutathione status of the redifferentiating hepatocyte.</p>

<p>Cell lines established from donors with the inherited disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) exhibit exceptional sensitivity to ionizing radiation and chemicals known to produce increased levels of intracellular H2O2, suggesting a deficiency in glutathione-dependent detoxication reactions. Glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis in fibroblast and lymphoblast cultures derived from individuals known to be clinically unaffected, homozygous, or heterozygous for A-T was assessed. Following GSH depletion by diethylmaleate, fibroblasts (GM 3492) from a clinically unaffected individual resynthesized GSH at a rate approximately twice that observed in fibroblasts from known heterozygotes (GM 3488 and GM 3489). Unrelated A-T homozygote fibroblast lines GM 3487B and GM 5823 resynthesized GSH only very slowly. GM 3492 cells repleted intracellular GSH by 6 h after depletion, the heterozygote lines by 18 h. The A-T homozygotes replaced only 30% of the intracellular GSH pool by 24 h. A lymphoblast cell line from the A-T homozygote (GM 3189) also exhibited slow resynthesis after depletion. However, if these cells were permeabilized by treatment with digitonin, GSH synthesis proceeded at a rate exceeding synthesis in permeabilized or untreated normal lymphoblasts (GM 3323). The first enzyme in GSH synthesis, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, was found to be elevated about 2.7-fold in A-T homozygote fibroblasts, suggesting that a substrate for GSH synthesis may be rate limiting. A-T homozygote lymphoblasts contained about 2-fold more gamma-cystathionase activity over other cell lines tested suggesting increased flux through the transsulfuration pathway for cysteine production in response to reduced cysteine supply. Transport of cysteine and cystine was found to be 8- and 5-fold slower in A-T homozygotes that did not affect fibroblasts while glutamate and methionine transport Vmax did not differ among the cell lines tested. These experiments demonstrate that cells from A-T homozygotes are deficient in cysteine transport, thus limiting GSH resynthesis after a depleting challenge such as radiation or GSH-depleting xenobiotic compounds.</p>

<p>The alleviation mechanism of methionine toxicity by dietary glycine was investigated in weanling rats fed a high-methionine diet. When rats were fed a 10% casein diet containing 2% methionine, the activities of methionine adenosyltransferase, cystathionine beta-synthase, and cystathionine gamma-lyase, which participate in the methionine metabolism in the transsulfuration pathway, were significantly enhanced. But the addition of 2% glycine to the high methionine diet did not cause further increase in these enzyme activities; the activities of methionine adenosyltransferase and cystathionine beta-synthase were rather decreased while cystathionine gamma-lyase activity was not altered. Methionine transaminase activity was essentially insensitive to the dietary addition of methionine and glycine. In rats fed a high methionine diet, the hepatic methionine level was significantly increased with a concomitant decrease in the levels of glycine, serine, and threonine. The addition of glycine to the high methionine diet effectively suppressed the enhancement of the hepatic methionine level and almost completely restored the glycine level, but it only partially restored the serine level and further decreased the threonine level. From these results, it is suggested that the alleviating effect of dietary glycine on methionine toxicity is primarily elicited by the restoration of the hepatic glycine level rather than by an increase in hepatic enzyme activity.</p>

<p>Several chick bioassays were conducted to evaluate means of ameliorating ethionine toxicity. Supplementing a corn-soy diet marginally deficient in sulfur amino acids (methionine + cystine) with .075% D,L-ethionine reduced weight gain in 8-day-old chicks by 70% compared to gains of unsupplemented controls. Dietary addition of .50% DL-methionine prevented reduction in weight gain and feed intake resulting from ethionine supplementation whereas feeding supplemental L-cystine was without effect. Supplementation of the ethionine-containing diet with either choline or betaine ameliorated the growth depression, although neither compound was able to completely overcome the toxic effects of ethionine. Dietary ethionine did not affect plasma levels of free methionine or cystine but did increase plasma free glycine 6-fold. Dietary addition of .50% DL-methionine caused normalization of plasma glycine levels whereas it elevated plasma methionine concentration. Although results suggested the possibility of ethionine-induced serine or threonine deficiency, dietary additions of .75% L-serine or .75% L-threonine failed to improve chick weight gain. These studies suggest that ethionine, in addition to affecting transsulfuration and transmethylation activity may exert specific effects on certain amino acids in tissue pools.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the blood coagulation changes in three patients with homocystinuria, in baseline condition and during therapy. At baseline, antithrombin III activity and factor VII levels were reduced in all three patients; antithrombin III protein and protein C antigen were also slightly lowered in one patient, and factor X in another. beta-Thromboglobulin, a measure of platelet activation, was increased in one case. During pyridoxine treatment, antithrombin III activity was rapidly restored to normal; factor VII increased and beta-thromboglobulin decreased. These data suggest that, in addition to platelet activation, abnormalities of blood clotting, and particularly reduction of antithrombin III, may play a role in the thrombotic tendency associated with homocystinuria. The nature of these clotting alterations is still uncertain, but their improvement during active metabolic treatment suggests that the defect in amino acid transsulfuration of homocystinuria may directly affect synthesis or activity of some liver-dependent clotting factors.</p>

<p>Cystine supplementation of adequate diets resulted in significantly higher hepatic levels of betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. Other changes occurred but were a function of the basal diet. When the latter contained 0.25% methionine + 0.5% cystine, the additional cystine caused a markedly lower hepatic cystathionine synthase activity and lower levels of both adenosylmethionine and serine. The metabolic effect of these changes may be enhanced methionine retention and diminished transsulfuration.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine amino acids were analyzed in the sera of 105 adult Senegambian goitrous patients classified as stages I, II, and III according to World Health Organization recommendations. Mean serum concentration of all essential amino acids revealed highly significant drops (p less than 0.001) as goiter stage increased, except for methionine (Met). Most nonessential amino acids (NEAA) and intermediary metabolites were similarly characterized by a general decrease to the subnormal range, although some resisted depression in stages II and III. Homocystine (Hcy) demonstrated a unique pattern in that it was the only NEAA distinguished by regularly rising serum levels. These data are consistent with the view that endemic goiter is associated with overall stepwise downregulation in protein metabolism. In addition to iodine restriction, generalized malnutrition may aggravate the goitrogenic processes. Serum levels of Met and Hcy strongly suggest that the first step of the transsulfuration pathway is impaired in protein-depleted states due to cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) deficiency.</p>

<p>Met metabolism occurs primarily by activation of Met to AdoMet and further metabolism of AdoMet by either the transmethylation-transsulfuration pathway or the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. The catabolism of the methyl group and sulfur atom of Met ultimately appears to be dependent upon the transmethylation-transsulfuration pathway because the MTA formed as the co-product of polyamine synthesis is efficiently recycled to Met. On the other hand, the fate of the four-carbon chain of Met appears to depend upon the initial fate of the Met molecule. During transsulfuration, the carbon chain is released as alpha-ketobutyrate, which is further metabolized to CO2. In the polyamine pathway, the carboxyl carbon of Met is lost in the formation of dAdoMet, whereas the other three carbons are ultimately excreted as polyamine derivatives and degradation products. The role of the transamination pathway of Met metabolism is not firmly established. Cys (which may be formed from the sulfur of Met and the carbons of serine via the transsulfuration pathway) appears to be converted to taurine and CO2 primarily by the cysteinesulfinate pathway, and to sulfate and pyruvate primarily by desulfuration pathways in which a reduced form of sulfur with a relatively long biological half-life appears to be an intermediate. With the exception of the nitrogen of Met that is incorporated into polyamines, the nitrogen of Met or Cys is incorporated into urea after it is released as ammonium [in the reactions catalyzed by cystathionase with either cystathionine (from Met) or cystine (from Cys) as substrate] or it is transferred to a keto acid (in Cys or Met transamination). Many areas of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism need further study. The magnitude of AdoMet flux through the polyamine pathway in the intact animal as well as details about the reactions involved in this pathway remain to be determined. Both the pathways and the possible physiological role of alternate (AdoMet-independent) Met metabolism, including the transamination pathway, must be elucidated. Despite the growing interest in taurine, investigation of Cys metabolism has been a relatively inactive area during the past two decades. Apparent discrepancies in the reported data on Cys metabolism need to be resolved. Future work should consider the role of extrahepatic tissues in amino acid metabolism as well as species differences in the relative roles of various pathways in the metabolism of Met and Cys.</p>

<p>Cystathionine gamma-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1) was purified from Streptomyces cattleya, an actinomycete which produces the unusual beta-lactam antibiotic thienamycin. The enzyme displays broad substrate specificity and is similar to gamma-lyases purified from other microorganisms. That the gamma-lyase functions in vivo to provide cysteine for antibiotic synthesis was shown by two types of experiments. First, cystathionine and methionine, as well as cysteine itself, are efficiently utilized by S. cattleya for thienamycin biosynthesis. Second, propargylglycine, a mechanism-based inactivator of cystathionine gamma-lyase in vitro, inhibits the synthesis of thienamycin in vivo. This inhibition can be substantially reversed by providing the cells with another source of cysteine, such as cystine.</p>

In the cirrhotic cases eating a mixed diet, levels of taurine, cysteine, plasma glutathione, and free choline were subnormal. During nasoenteral hyperalimentation, methionine was elevated while cysteine, glutathione, and free choline levels remained depressed. During TPN, levels of taurine, cysteine, protein-bound cysteine, glutathione, free choline, and phosphatidyl choline were depressed and methionine was elevated. In the noncirrhotic cases eating a mixed diet, only the free choline concentration was low. During nasoenteral hyperalimentation, the plasma levels of both free choline and total carnitine were depressed. During TPN, plasma levels of cystine, protein-bound cysteine, total carnitine, free choline, and phosphatidyl choline were subnormal. These data suggest that biosynthesis of several products of the transsulfuration pathway may be inadequate in both cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients during TPN with FreAmine III.</p>

<p>The effect of portacaval shunt (PCS) on methionine metabolism in the rat was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to PCS and maintained on an 18% casein diet. Growth curves of operated rats were similar to controls. PCS rats excreted more urinary 35SO4 and less [35S]taurine than controls after intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mmol/100 g [35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine. Total urinary taurine excretion was similar in PCS and control rats after a methionine or cysteine load; however, under basal conditions PCS rats had higher urinary taurine levels than controls, indicating that PCS may cause the taurine pool to be expanded. Hepatic methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, and cysteine pools were significantly decreased in PCS rats, while S-adenosylhomocysteine levels were unchanged. Relative rates of transsulfuration in PCS and control rats were studied by following the decrease in the 3H-to-35S ratio in liver protein after injection of [methyl-3H]methionine and [35S]methionine, and no difference in flux of 35S from [35S]methionine to [35S]cysteine was found. Similarly, total hepatic activities of methionine adenosyltransferase, cystathionine synthase, and cystathionine gamma-lyase were unchanged in PCS rats. These results indicate that altered methionine metabolism in PCS rats is not explained by changes in conversion of methionine to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>Cystathionine is an important intermediate in the transsulfuration pathway of methionine catabolism and is normally present in high concentration in the human CNS. We have measured the concentration of cystathionine, other amino acids, and brain proteins in the cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex and spinal cord of two cases with ceroid lipofuscinosis. Neuropathological and biochemical studies of Case 1, at an advanced stage, Case 2, at an early stage, and five controls were correlated with clinical and neurological findings. The concentration of an unidentified 54,000 Dalton protein was greatly increased in Case 1 as observed by 2-D gel electrophoresis. Neurons and cystathionine were almost totally absent from the cortex and cerebellum of Case 1, while they were slightly reduced in Case 2, in comparison to control brains. These studies suggest that cystathionine may be specifically located within neurons. We present for the first time the observation that there was a strikingly low brain concentration of cystathionine, a potential neuronal marker, in an advanced stage of a neurodegenerative process.</p>

<p>Methionine is a sulfur-containing essential amino acid and there are optic isomers of L- and D-type. It has been known that there are two metabolic pathways in methionine metabolism-the transsulfuration and the transamination. The purposes of the present investigation are to clarify the existence of transaminative pathway in human by the quantitative analysis of 3-methylthiopropionate (3-MTP), one of the metabolites of methionine, and to study its clinical significance in patients with liver cirrhosis. 3-MTP in urine was analysed by gas chromatograph equipped with the flame photometric detector (FPD) which has a highly specific sensitivity to the sulfur compounds. Fasting levels of 3-MTP concentration in urine in healthy subjects (n = 20) and patients with liver cirrhosis (n = 21) were 39.1 +/- 9.7 ng/mg. Cr. (Mean +/- SE) and 103.6 +/- 24.2 ng/mg. Cr., respectively. 3-MTP concentration in urine in cirrhotic patients was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects (p less than 0.05). In some cases, 3-MTP concentration in urine was measured every hour for 3 to 6 hours after the oral loading of 2 g of D- or L-methionine. In healthy subjects, 3-MTP concentration in urine increased remarkably at 1 hour period after oral loading of 2 g of D-methionine, and subsequently its concentration showed a tendency to decrease gradually. However, there were no such changes after oral loading of 2 g of L-methionine. When 2 g of D-methionine was loaded orally, decreasing curves of 3-MTP concentration in urine were different between healthy subjects and patients with liver cirrhosis, and half-disappearance time of 3-MTP concentration in urine was remarkably prolonged in cirrhotic patients. These findings seem to indicate that 3-MTP is one of the metabolites of methionine (especially of D-methionine) and the transaminative pathway exists in human. It was also suggested that there was the impairment of the transaminative pathway of methionine metabolism in patients with liver cirrhosis. Pharmacokinetics of 3-MTP in urine seems to contribute to the clinicopathological investigation of the liver cirrhosis.</p>

<p>Administration of methionine to growing Lemna had essentially no effect on accumulation of sulfate sulfur in protein cysteine, but decreased accumulation into cystathionine and its products (homocysteine, methionine, S-methylmethioninesulfonium salt, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine) to as low as 21% that of control plants, suggesting that methionine regulates its own de novo synthesis at cystathionine synthesis. Methionine caused only a slight reduction (to 80% that of control plants) in the accumulation of sucrose carbon into the 4-carbon moieties of cystathionine and products. This observation was puzzling since cystathionine synthesis proceeds by incorporation of equivalent amounts of sulfur (from cysteine) and 4-carbon moieties (from O-phosphohomoserine). The apparent inconsistency was resolved by the demonstration in Lemna (Giovanelli, Datko, Mudd, Thompson 1983 Plant Physiol 71: 319-326) that de novo synthesis of the methionine 4-carbon moiety occurs not only via the established transsulfuration route from O-phosphohomoserine, but also via the ribose moiety of 5’-methylthioadenosine. It is now clear that the more accurate assessment of the flux of sulfur (and 4-carbon moieties) through transsulfuration is provided by the amount of (35)S from (35)SO(4) (2-) that accumulates in cystathionine and its products, rather than by the corresponding measurements with (14)C. These studies therefore unequivocally demonstrate in higher plants that methionine does indeed feedback regulate it own de novo synthesis in vivo, and that cystathionine synthesis is a locus for this regulation.</p>

<p>The biochemical lesion in two cysteine auxotrophs of Tetrahymena thermophila has been established as a defect in S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, an enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway. As a result, these mutants require cysteine (or cystathionine or homocysteine) for growth in a defined medium. Cell-free extracts of the mutants contained less than 5% of the level of the enzyme seen in the wild type. One of the mutant strains accumulated intracellular levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine as high as 1380 microM, a level 200 times normal. When both mutant strains were maintained in defined medium without cysteine, growth occurred after a long lag; this phenomenon was termed “adaptation.” Adaptation was a) reversed by passage through rich medium, b) was not a recovery of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and c) was probably linked to induction of an alternate pathway for cysteine biosynthesis, involving a lysosomal S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase activity.</p>

<p>A pair of siblings with clinical symptoms of cyclic vomiting and ketoacidosis were found to have a biochemical triad of normoglycemia, ketoacidosis and elevated levels of alpha-hydroxy- and alpha-aminobutyrate in plasma and urine. Methionine loading studies in both sibs produced prompt rises in plasma methionine and alpha-aminobutyrate levels, with a subsequent increase in urinary alpha-hydroxybutyrate, as well. Leukocytes from both siblings showed normal oxidation of [3-14C]propionate. Increased inorganic sulfate excretion after methionine loading implied an intact transsulfuration pathway in both siblings. On the basis of the studies detailed in this report, we conclude that these siblings suffer from a defect in alpha-ketobutyrate oxidation, a newly described defect of organic acid metabolism.</p>

<p>Growth assays on a synthetic amino acid diet fed to mice showed that substituting D-methionine for the L-isomer resulted in a dose-dependent relative weight gain reaching approximately 76% when D-methionine was fed at a level equivalent to that optimal for the L-form. L-Cysteine and L-cystine stimulated growth in the presence of suboptimal levels of L-methionine, but D-cystine was growth depressing. L-Cystine is at least equally efficient in stimulating growth in the presence of D-methionine as in the presence of the L-isomer. Compared to a suboptimal (25% of maximum) level of L-methionine alone, supplements to this level L-methionine by N-acetyl-L-cysteine produced a weight gain of 214%; L-cysteine, 178%; L-cysteic acid, 154%; DL- + meso-lanthionine, 127%; L-cysteine sulfinic acid, 113%; D-cysteine, 76%; and S-methyl-L-cysteine, 13%. The observed growth-depressing effect of D-cysteine, D-cystine and S-methyl-L-cysteine at a concentration no greater than that optimal for methionine implies that these three sulfur-containing amino acids may be toxic. The results are discussed in terms of known and postulated transamination and transsulfuration pathways that govern the biological utilization of isomeric sulfur-containing amino acids and derivatives.</p>

<p>The metabolic effects of thiamine deficiency on the metabolism of lactate, acid-base and amino acids were evaluated both with and without muscular exercise in a controlled animal experiment. Thiamine deficiency - in good correlation with its biologic halftime and also with reports in the literature - caused with a latency of 17-56 days and statistically proven in parallel the following effects: hyperlactemia; in comparison to controls elevated plasma concentrations of threonine, alanine, glutamic acid, glutamine, histidine, methionine, taurine, valine, isoleucine and leucine; distinctly lowered - also in comparison to controls - plasma concentrations of arginine and tryptophan. Furthermore, in the thiamine deficient rats predetermined muscular exercise caused the following effects, also occurring concomitantly: life threatening lactacidosis; marked - statistically prover - disturbance of the homeostasis of alanine, glycine, methionine and arginine; distinctly - and statistically significant - elevated plasma concentration of proline; statistically significantly lowered plasma concentrations of taurine. The reasons for all these changes under thiamine deficiency is most likely a metabolic one primarily due to a disturbance of the utilization of pyruvate in the liver. An additional disturbance of both the transsulfuration pathway and the Krebs-Henseleit-cycle seems probable. The physiologic regulation of pyruvate, lactate, alanine, serine and tyrosine during muscular exercise in correlation to the controls is being discussed.</p>

<p>Cystathionine gamma-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1) is widely distributed in actinomycetes, e.g. genera Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Micropolyspora, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Streptosporangium, and Streptoverticillium. The enzyme was purified from Streptomyces phaeochromogenes (IFO 3105) in nine steps. After the last steps, the enzyme appeared to be homogenous by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analytical centrifugation, and double diffusion in agarose. The enzyme crystallized in the apo form with the addition of ammonium sulfate. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 166,000 and consists of four subunits identical in molecular weight. The enzyme exhibits absorption maxima at 278 and 421 nm and contains 4 mol of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate/mol of enzyme. L-Cystathionine, L-homoserine, DL-lanthionine, L-djenkolic acid, and L-cystine are cleaved as preferred substrates by the Streptomyces enzyme. The alpha, beta-elimination reaction of L-cystathionine is also catalyzed by the enzyme at a ratio of about one-seventh of the alpha, gamma-elimination reaction. Cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and cystathionine gamma-synthase (EC 4.2.99.9) activities were also detected in crude extracts of S. phaeochromogenes, but cystathionine beta-lyase (EC 4.4.1.8) was not. Consequently, the reverse transsulfuration pathway in actinomycetes may be similar to that in yeast and molds.</p>

<p>S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is metabolized through three main pathways, i.e. (a) transfer of its methyl group to a variety of methyl acceptors, (b) decarboxylation followed by aminopropylation leading to polyamine synthesis, and (c) cleavage of the bond between the sulfur atom and carbon 4 of the amino acid chain, resulting in formation of methylthioadenosine and homoserine thiolactone. In this study the metabolism of AdoMet through these pathways was studied after intravenous administration to rats of [1-14C]-, [3,4-14C]-, [methyl-14C]-, and [35S]AdoMet at various doses. The relative utilization of AdoMet and methionine was also investigated. The results show that intravenously administered AdoMet is efficiently metabolized in vivo up to the highest tested dose (250 mumol X kg-1 body weight), about two-thirds of the metabolized compound being utilized via transmethylation and cleavage to methylthioadenosine and one-third via decarboxylation. The efficient incorporation of the methyl group of AdoMet into muscle creatine indicates unambiguously that the compound is taken up and metabolized by the liver. Moreover, intravenously administered AdoMet is shown to be a better precursor than methionine both in creatine formation and in the utilization of the sulfur atom in transsulfuration reactions.</p>

<p>Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of selenium (Se) deficiency on the efficiency of cysteine formation from methionine (Met) in three strains of chickens. Hubbard, Leghorn, or crossbred (New Hampshire X Columbian) chicks were fed a crystalline amino acid diet that was fortified with both vitamin E and ethoxyquin but was essentially devoid of Se. The sulfur-containing amino acid (SAA) requirement was provided as equal quantities of Met and cystine (Cys-Cys) or as an isosulfurous level of Met alone. When fed diets unsupplemented with Se, all chicks exhibited depressed growth and markedly reduced blood glutathione peroxidase (SeGSH-Px) activities. SAA source had no effect on SeGSH-Px activity. Source of SAA also had no effect on growth rate of Leghorn or crossbred chicks, regardless of Se status. Se-deficient Hubbard chicks, on the other hand, gained faster and more efficiently when fed the Met-Cys-Cys combination than when fed an isosulfurous level of Met alone. Plasma concentrations of Cys-Cys and cystathionine were reduced in Se-deficient chicks of all strains. Homocystine was detected only in plasma of Hubbard chicks fed Se-adequate diets containing Met as the source of SAA. These findings support the view that transsulfuration efficiency may be impaired by Se deficiency in some strains of chickens.</p>

<p>The intracellular content and turnover of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) were measured in cultured human lymphoid cells. AdoMet levels were found to be 59 nmol/ml cell volume in exponentially growing WI-L2 lymphoblasts, 3.3-8.1 nmol/ml cell volume in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 25-33 nmol/ml cell volume 24-48 h after the latter were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Increases in the AdoMet content of stimulated cells occurred within 2 h after addition of lectin. First order, pool turnover rates were of the same order of magnitude (0.029-0.091/min) for all three types of cultured cells, but owing to the differences in AdoMet content, absolute utilization rates differed markedly and were 4.5, 0.12-0.40, and 1.41-1.57 nmol/min/ml cell volume in WI-L2, unstimulated peripheral mononuclear cells, and lectin-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells, respectively. Measurements of homocysteine accumulation in growth medium and of transsulfuration to cysteine indicate that a minimum of 82% of the AdoMet synthesized by WI-L2 is used for transmethylation. Remethylation of homocysteine by these cells could not be detected. AdoMet synthesis accounts for 20-23% of methionine utilization by WI-L2. Judging from the accumulation of homocysteine in the medium of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells, a minimum of 38% of AdoMet synthesized must be used for transmethylation. Even though AdoMet utilization by unstimulated peripheral mononuclear cells is relatively small compared to that of stimulated cells and WI-L2, our data indicate that AdoMet turnover in such “resting” cells is three to five times that estimated for nonhepatic tissues. These findings may be relevant to the hypothesis that lymphoid cells are unusually sensitive to inhibition of transmethylation reactions.</p>

<p>Evidence is presented that Lemna converts 5’-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. The methylthio moiety and four of the ribose carbons of the nucleoside contribute the methylthio and the four-carbon moieties of methionine. Plants grown in the presence of inhibitors which block methionine biosynthesis convert MTA to methionine at a rate sufficient to sustain normal growth (at least 4.4 nanomoles per colony per doubling with a molar yield of at least 65%). The pathway for conversion is shown to be constitutive in plants grown in standard medium and to function at a rate sufficient to dispose of MTA arising as a result of polyamine synthesis, and to explain the observed rate (1.4 nanomoles per colony per doubling) of preferential recycling of methionine sulfur (Giovanelli, Mudd, Datko 1981 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 100: 831-839). Rapid entry of methionine methyl into S-adenosylmethionine and phosphorylcholine was observed for plants grown in standard medium. Adenine generated during this cycle is efficiently salvaged into ADP and ATP.Conversion of MTA to methionine completes the steps in methionine thiomethyl recycling (Giovanelli, Mudd, Datko 1981 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 100: 831-839) in which the sulfur of methionine is retained while the four-carbon moiety is not. The findings further show that the four-carbon moiety of methionine can be derived via the ribose moiety of MTA in addition to the established route from O-phosphohomoserine via transsulfuration. Previous observations (Giovanelli, Mudd, Datko 1980 Biochemistry of Plants pp 453-505) can now be interpreted as establishing that exogenous methionine down-regulates its own net synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway.</p>

<p>Within the scope of clinically indicated total parenteral nutrition of premature infants, a comparative randomized study was performed to examine–by means of nitrogen-balance studies and determination of the free amino acids in the serum–the metabolic effects of absent or parallel intake of 1.140 mumol L-aspartic acid plus 2.160 mumol L-glutamic acid per kg body weight per day in complete L-amino acid solutions with a comparative E/T-ratio and with identical intake of all other nutrients adapted to the requirement. 1. The nitrogen balance level was not affected by the absent or parallel intake of the dicarbonic acids. 2. Intravenous intakes of glycine plus L-serine, which are higher than 2.5 mmol per kg body weight and day, caused statistically significant increased serum concentrations of glycine and L-serine. Such intakes are obviously above the physiologic regulation range. 3. The absent intake of L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid resulted in parallel, statistically significant reduced serum concentrations of aspartic acid and asparagine as well as in homeostatic serum concentrations of glutamic acid and glutamine. Despite the only 15-20% higher intake of proline, alanine and arginine under the infusion regimen lacking dicarbonic acids, there was a parallel, statistically significant marked increase in the serum concentrations of proline, alanine, arginine and methionine as well as a statistically significant marked decrease in those of taurine. Under the infusion regimen containing dicarbonic acids exclusively, constant homeostatic serum concentrations of these amino acids as well as of aspartic acid and glutamic acid were measured. 4. A direct or indirect effect of the exogenous supply of L-aspartic acid and/or L-glutamic acid on the homeostasis of aspartic acid and asparagine, on the endogenous turnover of L-alanine and L-proline as well as on the physiologic course of the Krebs-Henseleit cycle and of the “transsulfuration pathway” must be discussed. 5. Since the supply rates of L-aspartic acid plus L-glutamic acid chosen in series 2 (when continuously administered during 24-hour periods) apparently do not cause any disturbance in amino-acid homeostasis, it is established that under the nutritional conditions given this intake lies within the respective physiologic regulation range and therefore is atoxic.</p>

<p>The metabolism of methionine was studied in rainbow trout fed diets containing different levels of methionine and cystine. Growth data indicated that methionine requirement was between 0.5 and 1% dry diet in the absence of dietary cystine, but 0.5% was adequate when dietary cystine was 2%. In fish fed diets deficient in sulfur-containing amino acids, elevated hepatic activities of glutathione reductase were found, whereas glutathione peroxidase and glutathione levels were unaffected. Plasma and liver concentrations (18 hours after feeding) of methionine and cystine were affected by dietary methionine, but dietary cystine had little effect. Cystine appeared to be converted to taurine in the liver. In fish injected intraperitoneally with [14COOH]- and [14CH3]methionine, over 24 hours the carboxyl group was oxidized more than the methyl group and more was incorporated into protein. However, much more of the methyl group was incorporated into the lipid fraction. The results suggest the operation of the transsulfuration pathway of methionine catabolism. Oxidation of methionine was related to its concentration in the tissues, and little affected by dietary cystine. A 28-day experiment on the metabolism of injected [14COOH]methionine showed that its turnover was slow, and much of the radioactivity was associated with protein.</p>

<p>Isolated rat renal cortical tubules were used to study the nature of homocystine entry into the tubule cell and its transport interactions with cystine and the dibasic amino acids. The uptake of homocystine with time was progressive, reaching a steady state after 60 min. of incubation. Analysis of the intracellular pool after 5 and 30 min. of incubation revealed that virtually all of the transported homocystine had been converted to other metabolites of the transsulfuration pathway. The major metabolite was cystathionine with a somewhat lesser, but still significant amount as S-adenosylhomocysteine. A kinetic analysis showed that two systems for cellular entry of homocysteine existed with a Km1 of 0.17 mM and a Km2 of 7.65 mM. Arginine and lysine inhibited homocystine uptake via the low Km, high affinity system, but appeared not to inhibit the high Km, low affinity system. Cystine inhibited the low Km, high affinity system, but had an indeterminate effect on the high Km, low affinity system. Homocystine inhibited the uptake of cystine, lysine and arginine by isolated rat renal cortical tubules. The inhibition of homocystine on cystine uptake appeared to occur on both the high and low Km system for tubule cell entry of cystine. The data suggest that the low Km system for homocystine transport is shared with cystine and the dibasic amino acids. These data extend the knowledge of homocystine metabolism and provide a rational basis for new approaches to the treatment of homocystinuria.</p>

<p>Regulation of enzymes of methionine biosynthesis was investigated by measuring the specific activities of O-phosphohomoserine-dependent cystathionine gamma-synthase, O-phosphohomoserine sulfhydrylase, and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase in Lemna paucicostata Hegelm. 6746 grown under various conditions. For cystathionine gamma-synthase, it was observed that (a) adding external methionine (2 mum) decreased specific activity to 15% of control, (b) blocking methionine synthesis with 0.05 muml-aminoethoxyvinylglycine or with 36 mum lysine plus 4 mum threonine (Datko, Mudd 1981 Plant Physiol 69: 1070-1076) caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in specific activity, and (c) blocking methionine synthesis and adding external methionine led to the decreased specific activity characteristic of methionine addition alone. Activity in extracts from control cultures was unaffected by addition of methionine, lysine, threonine, lysine plus threonine, S-adenosylmethionine, or S-methylmethionine sulfonium to the assay mixture. Parallel studies of O-phosphohomoserine sulfhydrylase and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase showed that O-phosphohomoserine sulfhydrylase activity responded to growth conditions identically to cystathionine gamma-synthase activity, whereas O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase activity remained unaffected. Lemna extracts did not catalyze lanthionine formation from O-acetylserine and cysteine. Estimates of kinetic constants for the three enzyme activities indicate that O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase has much higher activity and affinity for sulfide than O-phosphohomoserine sulfhydrylase.The results suggest that (a) methionine, or one of its products, regulates the amount of active cystathionine gamma-synthase in Lemna, (b) O-phosphohomoserine sulfhydrylase and cystathionine gamma-synthase are probably activities of one enzyme that has low specificity for its sulfur-containing substrate, and (c) O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase is a separate enzyme. The relatively high activity and affinity for sulfide of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase provides an explanation in molecular terms for transsulfuration, and not direct sulfhydration, being the dominant pathway for homocysteine biosynthesis.</p>

<p>To permit an assessment of the relative contributions of the transsulfuration and the direct sulfhydration pathways for homocysteine biosynthesis, the time course of incorporation of (35)S from (35)SO(4) (2-) into various sulfur-containing compounds in Lemna paucicostata has been determined. Plants were grown with either low (4.5 micromolar) or ample (1,000 micromolar) sulfate in the medium. At the shortest labeling times, (35)S-cystathionine was the predominant (35)S-containing organic sulfur compound. The flux of sulfur into cystathionine was sufficient to sustain the known rate of methionine biosynthesis. It was calculated that transsulfuration accounted for at least 90 and 85% of the total homocysteine synthesis in low and ample sulfate-grown plants, respectively (and may have accounted for 100%). No marked rise in the (35)S-soluble cysteine:(35)S-homocysteine ratio was observed even at the shortest labeling times, but it is argued that this may be due to (a) the observed compartmentation of soluble cysteine, and (b) the impracticality of using labeling times shorter than 17 seconds. Additional evidence supporting the importance of transsulfuration in Lemna is briefly described.</p>

<p>To elucidate the recently advanced hypothesis that glutathione [L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl glycine (GSH)] regulates deiodinating enzyme activities, accounting for the decreased conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver of fetal and starved animals, we investigated thyroid hormone metabolism in GSH-depleted neoplastic and normal hepatocytes. In monkey hepatocarcinoma cells, intracellular total GSH decreased below 10% of the control value (approximately 25 micrograms/mg protein) when cells were grown for 44 h in medium deficient in cystine and methionine or in cystine alone. The latter finding indicated that transsulfuration from methionine to cysteine was defective in these neoplastic cells. In primary cultured adult rat hepatocytes, on the other hand, the transsulfuration pathway was intact, and total GSH decreased below 10% of control (approximately 20 micrograms/mg protein) only in cells grown in cystine- and methionine-deficient medium. In both cell types, the oxidized GSH fraction remained constant (2-5% of total). Incubation with 125I-labeled T4 and T3, followed by chromatography, was used to evaluate 5-deiodination in hepatocarcinoma cells and both 5- and 5’-deiodination in normal hepatocytes. Deiodination was not decreased by GSH deficiency in either case, but was actually increased in hepatocarcinoma cells. This resulted from an increase in the Vmax of 5-deiodinase related to growth arrest. Diamide at 2 mM reversibly inhibited both 5’- and 5’-deiodination in rat hepatocytes, accompanied by decreased total GSH as well as increased GSH disulfide (27% of total). The data suggest that GSH is so abundant in the liver that hepatocytes can tolerate a greater than 90% decrease in intracellular concentration without any change in thyroid hormone deiodination and indicate that altered thyroid hormone metabolism in the fetus and in starvation cannot be accounted for by a decreased hepatic GSH concentration.</p>

<p>Extracts of the cephamycin C producer S. lactamdurans were found to possess cystathionine gamma-lyase activity (E.C. 4.4.1.1). This represents the first demonstration of this enzyme of the reverse transsulfuration pathway in a prokaryotic organism. A likely involvement of reverse transsulfuration in antibiotic synthesis is indicated by the fact that propargylglycine, a mechanism-based inhibitor of the gamma-lyase, is a strong inhibitor of cephamycin C production.</p>

<p>Twelve growing Swine were fed an 18% protein diet (Maize and Soja bean) for one hundred days containing either 0,6% sulfur amino acids (basal diet) or 0,6% and 1% DL-methionine added to the control diet. Such an excess, reduced food intake and body weight gain mainly during the “finishing period” (60 to 100 kg). The RNA/DNA and protein/DNA ratios in the muscle did not show any difference. Hepatic activities of some enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism, were unchanged, except that of methionine adenosyl transferase, the first step of transsulfuration, which was induced in proportion with the amount of the methionine ingested. Swine seemed to adapt to the excessive methionine intake, which did not show any toxicity in our experimental conditions.</p>

<p>The physiological roles of the transsulfuration and direct sulfhydration pathways in Chlorella sorokiniana growing under steady state photoautotrophic conditions with limiting sulfate were studied by following the patterns of assimilation of 35SO4(2-) into sulfur amino acids. The labeling patterns expected of each pathway were defined by means of models based on the rates of net synthesis of the terminal pools of GSH, protein cysteine, and protein methionine. The labeling patterns observed are entirely consistent with the transsulfuration pathway and inconsistent with the direct sulfhydration pathway. By analysis of the amounts of radioactivity present in key intermediates at labeling times as short as 1 s, it was demonstrated that direct sulfhydration makes no detectable contribution to homocysteine biosynthesis, and if operative contributes no more than approximately 3% of the total homocysteine biosynthesized. From the combined determinations of the initial rates of labeling and net rates of synthesis of the various sulfur amino acids, a tentative working model is presented that summarizes our best current estimates of the major fluxes of sulfur in the experimental system. The labeling data further showed that soluble cysteine consists of at least two pools. One pool, termed “rapidly turning over” cysteine comprises less than 1% of the total soluble cysteine, and is the precursor of GSH, protein cysteine, and, almost certainly, cystathionine. The other pool, “slowly turning over” cysteine, appears to be in equilibrium with “rapidly turning over” cysteine, but not to be further metabolized.</p>

<p>Metabolism of L-[35S]cystathionine, L-[35S]cysteine and L-[35S]homocysteine has been investigated in Astragalus pectinatus. The results indicate that cystathionine undergoes both beta and gamma cleavage to give homocysteine and cysteine. Results also show that cystathionine is synthesized from both cysteine and homocysteine. Furthermore, in addition to the incorporation of 35S into cystathionine, incorporation of 35S from cysteine into methionine and from homocysteine into S-methylcysteine is not only in agreement with the above cystathionine cleavage activities, but also suggests, that transsulfuration in A. pectinatus proceeds in both directions, eg. cysteine leads to cystathionine leads to homocysteine and homocysteine leads to cystathionine leads to cysteine. It is suggested, that the latter reaction may be contributing to the net synthesis of cysteine.</p>

<p>Four enzymes necessary for the metabolism of methionine by the trans-sulfuration pathway, methionine adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6), adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1), cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1) were identified in Tetrahymean pyriformis. The ability of these cells to transfer 35S from E135S]methionine to form [35S] cysteine was also observed and taken as direct evidence for the functional existence of this pathway in Tetrahymena. An intermediate in the pathway and an active methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine, was qualitatively identified in Tetrahymena and its concentration was found to be greater in late stationary phase cells than in early stationary phase cells.</p>

<p>Desulfuration of L-cysteine by rat liver via a pathway of transamination followed by transsulfuration was studied using cyanide as a sulfur acceptor. More than a 5-fold increase in formation of thiocyanate from L-cysteine and cyanide was observed in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate. L-Cysteine aminotransferase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase activities in the same preparations were also determined. It was concluded that L-cysteine was desulfurated through transamination and transsulfuration of the resulting 3-mercaptopyruvate, and that the rate-limiting step appears to be the transamination reaction.</p>

<p>When a diet containing raw soybean was fed to rats, there was an increase in the synthesis of pancreatic protein, presumably exocrine protein, as evidenced by an increased uptake of [35S]cystine. There was also an increased transsulfuration of methionine sulfur as indicated by labeled sulfur transformation from methionine to cystine. This same pattern of events was produced in rats receiving a casein-containing diet when 50 mg of crystalline trypsin inhibitor was administered by gavage. However, if coprophagy was prevented, the increased uptake of [35S]cystine and [35S]methionine transsulfuration under both dietary conditions was blocked. It was found that prevention of coprophagy was without effect upon these two processes if supplementary dietary cystine was provided or if a dietary protein source with adequate cystine, i.e., heat-treated soybean, was provided. It was concluded that by practicing coprophagy, sufficient fecal cystine was being returned to the upper intestinal tract to permit some synthesis of pancreatic exocrine protein and with this stimulation of synthesis, transulfuration could proceed. This assumes that the biosynthesis of cystine is dependent upon the availability of sufficient cystine to permit active protein synthesis. In another situation where cystine requirement is high, namely, the rapidly growing rat, a limited amount of cystine was fed by providing a 12% casein diet. Either supplementary cystine or methionine was provided and it was found that both amino acids gave optimal growth in conventional rats, but when coprophagy was prevented, optimal growth was achieved only with the cystine-supplemented diet.</p>

<p>The previously reported inability of methionine to stimulate cephalosporin C production in a cysteine auxotroph is due to cysteine interference with methionine uptake. In such a cse, “illicit transport” of alanylmethionine can be used to demonstrate the efficacy of methionine in such mutants blocked in the path from methionine to cysteine. This result supports the hypothesis that the stimulatory activity of methionine is not due to its ability to donate sulfur to the caphalosporin C molecule.</p>

<p>An early blocked sulfur amino acid auxotroph, Cephalosporium acremonium mutant 274-1 (which could be satisfied by methionine or cysteine), utilized organic sulfur compounds for cephalosporin C production in the following order of decreasing effectiveness; methionine &gt; cystathionine &gt; cysteine, despite the fact that cysteine is considered to be the immediate precursor of the antibiotic. When a genetic block was added to mutant 274-1 in the transsulfuration pathway from cysteine to methionine, the double mutant 11-8 (which grows on methonine but not cysteine) failed to produce cephalosporin C from cysteine even though enough methionine was added to support normal growth. Addition of the non-sulfur analogue, norleucine, resulted in antibiotic production from cysteine in the double mutant. These facts support the hypothesis that methionine stimulation of cephalosporin C production is due to a role of methionine other than that of sulfur donation.</p>

<p>Incorporation of radioactivity from L-3-(14) C-serine into DNA was at least 2-fold higher in fetal human liver slices (413 +/- 21 dpm/mg wet weight/h); the incorporation into RNA by fetal human liver slices (49 +/- 6 dpm/mg wet weight/h) was 10-fold lower than into DNA. These incorporations were not limited by endogenous methionine. When the serine concentration of the liver slices is taken into consideration, the synthesis of DNA utilizing the beta-carbon atom of serine was 4-fold higher in fetal human liver slices than in mature human liver slices. Those results suggest that the modified pathways of transsulfuration of methionine metabolism and remethylation of homocysteine to methionine may be an adaptation by the human fetus for diverting the beta-carbon atom of serine into de novo synthesis of DNA.</p>

<p>EXTRACTS OF PHYLOGENETICALLY DIVERSE PLANS WERE SURVEYED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE THE FOLLOWING HOMOSERINE ESTERS WHICH ARE POTENTIAL PRECURSORS FOR METHIONINE AND THREONINE SYNTHESIS IN GREEN PLANTS: O-acetyl-, O-oxalyl-, O-succinyl-, O-malonyl-, and O-phosphohomoserine. Synthesis of O-acylhomoserine esters was detected only in Pisum sativum L. and Lathyrus sativus L. Extracts of P. sativum, a plant known to accumulate O-acetylhomoserine, catalyzed the specific synthesis of this ester from homoserine and acetyl-CoA. Extracts of L. sativus, a plant known to accumulate O-oxalylhomoserine, catalyzed the specific synthesis of this ester from homoserine and oxalyl-CoA. None of the other plants surveyed, including representatives of the green algae, horsetails, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, catalyzed the synthesis of any of the O-acylhomoserine esters studied. In contrast, synthesis of O-phosphohomoserine by the reaction catalyzed by homoserine kinase was demonstrated in extracts of all plants examined, including the two exceptional legumes.These results suggest that, among the five homoserine esters studied, O-phosphohomoserine is the major activated homoserine derivative in plants. Direct confirmation of the dominant physiological role of O-phosphohomoserine in the synthesis of cystathionine in the transsulfuration pathway of methionine biosynthesis in plants has recently been provided (Datko, A. H., Giovanelli, J., and Mudd, S. H. 1974. J. Biol. Chem. 249: 1139-1155).</p>

<p>Rhizobitoxine has previously been shown to inactivate irreversibly beta-cystathionase isolated from spinach. In the present studies, rhizobitoxine was shown to inhibit partially beta-cystathionase of spinach and corn seedlings in vivo. An activity of 30 to 40% of normal remained in toxin-treated seedlings of both spinach and corn. Possible reasons for the partial inhibition are discussed.Rhizobitoxine-treated and control corn seedlings were allowed to assimilate (35)SO(4) (2-) for 3 or 6 hours, and the radioactivity incorporated into sulfur amino acids at these times was studied. The most striking effect of rhizobitoxine was an increase (up to 22-fold) in radioactive cystathionine. Accumulation of radioactivity in methionine was only slightly inhibited by rhizobitoxine treatment. The results strongly suggest that the transsulfuration pathway contributes to methionine biosynthesis, and that metabolism via this pathway is impaired, but not entirely eliminated, by rhizobitoxine treatment.The present data do not permit decisions about the relative contributions of the transsulfuration and the direct sulfhydration pathways to methionine biosynthesis, or whether the pathological effects of rhizobitoxine are due chiefly to inhibition of beta-cystathionase.</p>

<p>The development of activity of methionine-activating enzyme was studied in four organs of the rat. Three different patterns were observed: (a) in the liver, specific activity began to increase in late fetal life and reached a maximum 2 days after birth; (b) in the small intestine, specific activity began to rise in the 2nd wk after birth and reached a maximum at age 18 days; and (c) in the brain and kidney, specific activity did not change markedly from the earliest stage of fetal development studied to adult life. Hydrocortisone increased hepatic methionine-activating enzyme activity as much as 55% in the young rat. However, adrenalectomy in the newborn rat did not prevent the postnatal rise in hepatic methionine-activating enzyme activity, nor did adrenalectomy at age 10 days prevent the developmental rise of intestinal activity at age 18 days. Conjugated estrogens partially inhibited both the neonatal rise in hepatic methionine-activating enzyme activity and the rise in activity after adrenal steroid injection. Injection of L-methionine did not increase hepatic methionine-activating enzyme activity in the developing or adult rat.</p>
