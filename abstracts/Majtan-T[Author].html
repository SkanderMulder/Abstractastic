<p>AIMS: PEGylated human truncated cystathionine beta-synthase, lacking the C-terminal regulatory domain (PEG-CBS), is a promising preclinical candidate for enzyme replacement therapy in homocystinuria (HCU). It was designed to function as a metabolic sink to decrease the severely elevated plasma and tissue homocysteine concentrations. In this communication, we evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and sub-chronic toxicity of PEG-CBS in homocystinuric mice, wild type rats and monkeys to estimate the minimum human efficacious dose for clinical trials.MAIN METHODS: Animal models received single or multiple doses of PEG-CBS. Activity of PEG-CBS and sulfur amino acid metabolites were determined in plasma and used to determine PK and PD.KEY FINDINGS: The plasma half-lives of PEG-CBS after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection were approximately 20, 44 and 73<U+202F>h in mouse, rat and monkey, respectively. The SC administration of PEG-CBS resulted in a significant improvement or full correction of metabolic imbalance in both blood and tissues of homocystinuric mice. The PD of PEG-CBS in mouse was dose-dependent, but less than dose-proportional, with the maximal efficacy achieved at 8<U+202F>mg/kg. PEG-CBS was well-tolerated in mice and monkeys, but resulted in dose-dependent minimal-to-moderate inflammation at the injection sites and vacuolated macrophages in rats. Allometric scaling of animal data was linear and the estimated human efficacious dose was determined as 0.66<U+202F>mg/kg administered once a week.SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide critical preclinical data for the design of first-in-human PEG-CBS clinical trial.</p>

<p>Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is the most common inherited disorder of sulfur amino acid metabolism caused by deficiency in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity and characterized by severe elevation of homocysteine in blood and tissues. Treatment with dietary methionine restriction is not optimal, and poor compliance leads to serious complications. We developed an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and studied its efficacy in a severe form of HCU in mouse (the I278T model). Treatment was initiated before or after the onset of clinical symptoms in an effort to prevent or reverse the phenotype. ERT substantially reduced and sustained plasma homocysteine concentration at around 100 µM and normalized plasma cysteine for up to 9 months of treatment. Biochemical balance was also restored in the liver, kidney, and brain. Furthermore, ERT corrected liver glucose and lipid metabolism. The treatment prevented or reversed facial alopecia, fragile and lean phenotype, and low bone mass. In addition, structurally defective ciliary zonules in the eyes of I278T mice contained low density and/or broken fibers, while administration of ERT from birth partially rescued the ocular phenotype. In conclusion, ERT maintained an improved metabolic pattern and ameliorated many of the clinical complications in the I278T mouse model of HCU.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), the key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, links methionine metabolism to the biosynthesis of cellular redox controlling molecules. CBS catalyzes the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine, which is subsequently converted into cysteine. Besides maintaining cellular sulfur amino acid homeostasis, CBS also catalyzes multiple hydrogen sulfide-generating reactions using cysteine and homocysteine as substrates. In mammals, CBS is activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), where it can adopt two different conformations (basal and activated), but exists as a unique highly active species in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present the crystal structure of CBS from honeybey Apis mellifera, which shows a constitutively active dimeric species and let explain why the enzyme is not allosterically regulated by AdoMet. In addition, comparison of available CBS structures unveils a substrate-induced closure of the catalytic cavity, which in humans is affected by the AdoMet-dependent regulation and likely impaired by the homocystinuria causing mutation T191M.</p>

<p>Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is the most common loss-of-function inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism. HCU is caused by a deficiency in enzymatic degradation of homocysteine, a toxic intermediate of methionine transformation to cysteine, chiefly due to missense mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. As with many other inherited disorders, the pathogenic mutations do not target key catalytic residues, but rather introduce structural perturbations leading to an enhanced tendency of the mutant CBS to misfold and either to form nonfunctional aggregates or to undergo proteasome-dependent degradation. Correction of CBS misfolding would represent an alternative therapeutic approach for HCU. In this review, we summarize the complex nature of CBS, its multi-domain architecture, the interplay between the three cofactors required for CBS function [heme, pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)], as well as the intricate allosteric regulatory mechanism only recently understood, thanks to advances in CBS crystallography. While roughly half of the patients respond to treatment with a PLP precursor pyridoxine, many studies suggested usefulness of small chemicals, such as chemical and pharmacological chaperones or proteasome inhibitors, rescuing mutant CBS activity in cellular and animal models of HCU. Non-specific chemical chaperones and proteasome inhibitors assist in mutant CBS folding process and/or prevent its rapid degradation, thus resulting in increased steady-state levels of the enzyme and CBS activity. Recent interest in the field and available structural information will hopefully yield CBS-specific compounds, by using high-throughput screening and computational modeling of novel ligands, improving folding, stability, and activity of CBS mutants.</p>

<p>Skeletal and connective tissue defects are the most striking symptoms in patients suffering from classical homocystinuria (HCU). Here, we determined body composition and bone mass in three mouse models of HCU and assessed whether a long-term administration of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) corrected the phenotype. The mouse models of HCU were analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the data were complemented by plasma biochemical profiles. Both the mouse model lacking CBS (KO) and the one expressing human CBS mutant transgene on a mouse CBS null background (I278T) showed marked bone loss and decreased weight mostly due to a lower fat content compared with negative controls. In contrast, the HO mouse expressing the human CBS WT transgene on a mouse CBS null background showed no such phenotype despite similar plasma biochemical profile to the KO and I278T mice. More importantly, administration of ERT rescued bone mass and changes in body composition in the KO mice treated since birth and reversed bone loss and improved fat content in the I278T mice injected after the development of clinical symptoms. Our study suggests that ERT for HCU may represent an effective way of preventing the skeletal problems in patients without a restricted dietary regime.</p>

<p>Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is an inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism caused by deficient activity of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), resulting in an accumulation of homocysteine and a concomitant decrease of cystathionine and cysteine in blood and tissues. In mice, the complete lack of CBS is neonatally lethal. In this study, newborn CBS-knockout (KO) mice were treated with recombinant polyethyleneglycolylated human truncated CBS (PEG-CBS). Full survival of the treated KO mice, along with a positive impact on metabolite levels in plasma, liver, brain, and kidneys, was observed. The PEG-CBS treatment prevented an otherwise fatal liver disease characterized by steatosis, death of hepatocytes, and ultrastructural abnormalities of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Furthermore, treatment of the KO mice for 5 mo maintained the plasma metabolite balance and completely prevented osteoporosis and changes in body composition that characterize both the KO model and human patients. These findings argue that early treatment of patients with HCU with PEG-CBS may prevent clinical symptoms of the disease possibly without the need of dietary protein restriction.-Majtan, T., Hulková, H., Park, I., Krijt, J., Kožich, V., Bublil, E.

<p>Homocystinuria due to loss of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) causes accumulation of homocysteine and depletion of cysteine. Current treatments are suboptimal, and thus the development of an enzyme replacement therapy based on PEGylated human truncated CBS (PEG-CBS) has been initiated. Attenuation of potency was observed, which necessitated a screen of several PEG-CBS conjugates for their efficacy to correct and maintain the plasma metabolite profile of murine homocystinuria after repeated administrations interrupted with washouts. We found that CBS coupling with maleimide PEG inconsistently modified the enzyme. In contrast, the PEG-CBS conjugate with 20 kDa N-hydroxysuccinimide-PEG showed very little loss of potency likely due to a reproducible PEGylation resulting in species modified with five PEGs per subunit on average. We developed assays suitable for monitoring the extent of CBS PEGylation and demonstrated a sustainable partial normalization of homocystinuria upon continuous PEG-CBS administration via osmotic pumps. Taken together, we identified the PEG-CBS conjugate suitable for manufacturing and clinical development.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) plays a key role in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. CBS is a multidomain tetrameric enzyme allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Recent crystallographic analyses of engineered CBS lacking the loop made up of residues 516-525 revealed discrepancies in AdoMet binding compared to previous biophysical studies on a full-length CBS. Here, we show that removal of the loop 516-525 functionally eliminates the high affinity sites responsible for kinetic stabilization of the full-length enzyme and yields a dimeric AdoMet-inducible enzyme, in which kinetic stabilization is now exerted by AdoMet binding to the remaining low affinity sites.</p>

<p>Homocystinuria, which typically results from cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency, is the most common defect of sulfur amino acid metabolism. CBS condenses homocysteine and serine to cystathionine that is then converted to cysteine. Individuals with homocystinuria have markedly elevated plasma levels of homocysteine and methionine and reduced concentrations of cystathionine and cysteine. Clinical disease manifestations include thromboembolism and neuropsychiatric, ocular, and skeletal complications. Here, we have shown that administration of PEGylated CBS into the circulation of homocystinuria model mice alters the extra- and intracellular equilibrium of sulfur amino acids, resulting in a decrease of approximately 75% in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and normalization of cysteine concentrations. Moreover, the decrease in homocysteine and the normalization of cysteine in PEGylated CBS-treated model mice were accompanied by improvement of histopathological liver symptoms and increased survival. Together, these data suggest that CBS enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a promising approach for the treatment of homocystinuria and that ERT for metabolic diseases may not necessitate introduction of the deficient enzyme into its natural intracellular compartment.</p>

<p>Many pathogenic missense mutations in human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) cause misfolding of the mutant enzyme resulting in aggregation or rapid degradation of the protein. Subsequent loss of CBS function leads to CBS-deficient homocystinuria (CBSDH). CBS contains two sets of binding sites for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that independently regulate the enzyme activity and kinetically stabilize its regulatory domain. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that CBS activation may be decoupled from kinetic stabilization and thus CBS regulatory domain can serve as a novel drug target for CBSDH. We determined the effect of SAM and its close structural analogs on CBS activity, their binding to and stabilization of the regulatory domain in the absence and presence of competing SAM. Binding of S-adenosylhomocysteine and sinefungin lead to stabilization of the regulatory domains without activation of CBS. Direct titrations and competition experiments support specific binding of these two SAM analogs to the stabilizing sites. Binding of these two ligands also affects the enzyme proteolysis rate supporting the role of the stabilizing sites in CBS dynamics. Our results indicate that binding of SAM to regulatory and stabilizing sites in CBS may have evolved to display an exquisite thermodynamic and structural specificity towards SAM as well as the ability to transduce the allosteric signal responsible for CBS activation. Thus, ligands may be developed to function as kinetic stabilizers or pharmacological chaperones without interfering with the physiological activation of CBS by SAM.</p>

<p>Two enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine -cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and gamma-cystathionase (CTH)-use cysteine and/or homocysteine to produce the important signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and simultaneously the thioethers lanthionine, cystathionine or homolanthionine. In this study we explored whether impaired flux of substrates for H2S synthesis and/or deficient enzyme activities alter production of hydrogen sulfide in patients with homocystinurias. As an indirect measure of H2S synthesis we determined by LC-MS/MS concentrations of thioethers in plasma samples from 33 patients with different types of homocystinurias, in 8 patient derived fibroblast cell lines, and as reaction products of seven purified mutant CBS enzymes. Since chaperoned recombinant mutant CBS enzymes retained capacity of H2S synthesis in vitro it can be stipulated that deficient CBS activity in vivo may impair H2S production. Indeed, in patients with classical homocystinuria we observed significantly decreased cystathionine and lanthionine concentrations in plasma (46% and 74% of median control levels, respectively) and significantly lower cystathionine in fibroblasts (8% of median control concentrations) indicating that H2S production from cysteine and homocysteine may be also impaired. In contrast, the grossly elevated plasma levels of homolanthionine in CBS deficient patients (32-times elevation compared to median of controls) clearly demonstrates a simultaneous overproduction of H2S from homocysteine by CTH. In the remethylation defects the accumulation of homocysteine and the increased flux of metabolites through the transsulfuration pathway resulted in elevation of cystathionine and homolanthionine (857% and 400% of median control values, respectively) indicating a possibility of an increased biosynthesis of H2S by both CBS and CTH. This study shows clearly disturbed thioether concentrations in homocystinurias, and modeling using these data indicates that H2S synthesis may be increased in these conditions. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to explore the possible implications for pathophysiology of these disorders.</p>

<p>A library consisting of characterized marine natural products as well as synthetic derivatives was screened for compounds capable of inhibiting the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Eight hits were validated and shown to inhibit CBS activity with IC50 values ranging from 83 to 187µM. The majority of hits came from a series of synthetic polyandrocarpamine derivatives. In addition, a modified fluorogenic probe for H2S detection with improved solubility in aqueous solutions is reported.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a heme-dependent and pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent protein that controls the flux of sulfur from methionine to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, taurine, and H2S. Deficiency of CBS activity causes homocystinuria, the most frequent disorder of sulfur amino acid metabolism. In contrast to CBSs from lower organisms, human CBS (hCBS) is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which binds to the regulatory domain and triggers a conformational change that allows the protein to progress from the basal toward the activated state. The structural basis of the underlying molecular mechanism has remained elusive so far. Here, we present the structure of hCBS with bound AdoMet, revealing the activated conformation of the human enzyme. Binding of AdoMet triggers a conformational change in the Bateman module of the regulatory domain that favors its association with a Bateman module of the complementary subunit to form an antiparallel CBS module. Such an arrangement is very similar to that found in the constitutively activated insect CBS. In the presence of AdoMet, the autoinhibition exerted by the regulatory region is eliminated, allowing for improved access of substrates to the catalytic pocket. Based on the availability of both the basal and the activated structures, we discuss the mechanism of hCBS activation by AdoMet and the properties of the AdoMet binding site, as well as the responsiveness of the enzyme to its allosteric regulator. The structure described herein paves the way for the rational design of compounds modulating hCBS activity and thus transsulfuration, redox status, and H2S biogenesis.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a key regulator of sulfur amino acid metabolism diverting homocysteine, a toxic intermediate of the methionine cycle, via the transsulfuration pathway to the biosynthesis of cysteine. Although the pathway itself is well conserved among eukaryotes, properties of eukaryotic CBS enzymes vary greatly. Here we present a side-by-side biochemical and biophysical comparison of human (hCBS), fruit fly (dCBS) and yeast (yCBS) enzymes. Preparation and characterization of the full-length and truncated enzymes, lacking the regulatory domains, suggested that eukaryotic CBS exists in one of at least two significantly different conformations impacting the enzyme’s catalytic activity, oligomeric status and regulation. Truncation of hCBS and yCBS, but not dCBS, resulted in enzyme activation and formation of dimers compared to native tetramers. The dCBS and yCBS are not regulated by the allosteric activator of hCBS, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet); however, they have significantly higher specific activities in the canonical as well as alternative reactions compared to hCBS. Unlike yCBS, the heme-containing dCBS and hCBS showed increased thermal stability and retention of the enzyme’s catalytic activity. The mass-spectrometry analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry showed clear presence and binding of AdoMet to yCBS and hCBS, but not dCBS. However, the role of AdoMet binding to yCBS remains unclear, unlike its role in hCBS. This study provides valuable information for understanding the complexity of the domain organization, catalytic specificity and regulation among eukaryotic CBS enzymes.</p>

<p>Human cystathionine ß-synthase (hCBS) is a key enzyme of sulfur amino acid metabolism, controlling the commitment of homocysteine to the transsulfuration pathway and antioxidant defense. Mutations in hCBS cause inherited homocystinuria (HCU), a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by accumulation of toxic homocysteine in blood and urine. hCBS is a complex multidomain and oligomeric protein whose activity and stability are independently regulated by the binding of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) to two different types of sites at its C-terminal regulatory domain. Here we study the role of surface electrostatics on the complex regulation and stability of hCBS using biophysical and biochemical procedures. We show that the kinetic stability of the catalytic and regulatory domains is significantly affected by the modulation of surface electrostatics through noticeable structural and energetic changes along their denaturation pathways. We also show that surface electrostatics strongly affect SAM binding properties to those sites responsible for either enzyme activation or kinetic stabilization. Our results provide new insight into the regulation of hCBS activity and stability in vivo with implications for understanding HCU as a conformational disease. We also lend experimental support to the role of electrostatic interactions in the recently proposed binding modes of SAM leading to hCBS activation and kinetic stabilization.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine, with the release of water. In humans, deficiency in CBS activity is the most common cause of hyperhomocysteinaemia and homocystinuria. More than 160 pathogenic mutations in the human CBS gene have been described to date. Here, the purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the catalytic core of CBS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScCBS) is described which, in contrast to other eukaryotic CBSs, lacks the N-terminal haem-binding domain and is considered to be a useful model for investigation of the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-mediated reactions of human CBS (hCBS). The purified protein yielded two different crystal forms belonging to space groups P41212 and P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 72.390, c = 386.794 Å and a = 58.156, b = 89.988, c = 121.687 Å, respectively. Diffraction data were collected to 2.7 and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively, using synchrotron radiation. Preliminary analysis of the X-ray data suggests the presence of ScCBS homodimers in both types of crystals.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) controls the flux of sulfur from methionine to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, taurine, and H2S. CBS condenses serine and homocysteine to cystathionine with the help of three cofactors, heme, pyridoxal-5’-phosphate, and S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Inherited deficiency of CBS activity causes homocystinuria, the most frequent disorder of sulfur metabolism. We present the structure of the human enzyme, discuss the unique arrangement of the CBS domains in the C-terminal region, and propose how they interact with the catalytic core of the complementary subunit to regulate access to the catalytic site. This arrangement clearly contrasts with other proteins containing the CBS domain including the recent Drosophila melanogaster CBS structure. The absence of large conformational changes and the crystal structure of the partially activated pathogenic D444N mutant suggest that the rotation of CBS motifs and relaxation of loops delineating the entrance to the catalytic site represent the most likely molecular mechanism of CBS activation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Moreover, our data suggest how tetramers, the native quaternary structure of the mammalian CBS enzymes, are formed. Because of its central role in transsulfuration, redox status, and H2S biogenesis, CBS represents a very attractive therapeutic target. The availability of the structure will help us understand the pathogenicity of the numerous missense mutations causing inherited homocystinuria and will allow the rational design of compounds modulating CBS activity.</p>

<p>Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) appears to be a major protease responsible for the degradation of matrix and growth-promoting agents in chronic wounds. Honey has been successfully used for treating non-healing wounds associated with infections. However, the mechanisms of its action at the cellular level have remained poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fir honeydew honey on TNF-a-induced MMP-9 expression and secretion from human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and to identify the honey component(s) responsible for a discovered effect. A C18 solid-phase column was used for preparation of honey aqueous extract (HAE). Expression and production of MMP-9 by HaCaT cells were determined by reverse transcription-PCR, gelatine zymography and Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against MMP-9. We found that HAE inhibited TNF-a-induced production of MMP-9 in keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner at both the mRNA and protein levels. Apigenin and kaempferol, identified flavonoids in HAE, markedly inhibited MMP-9 production from HaCaT and epidermal keratinocytes. Taken together, fir honeydew honey, which contains certain flavonoids, prevents TNF-a-induced proteolytic activity in cutaneous inflammation. Thus, our findings provide clear evidence that honey may serve as a natural treatment for dermatological problems associated with a persistent inflammation.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, namely the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine. Mutations in the CBS gene are the single most common cause of hereditary homocystinuria, a multisystemic disease affecting to various extents the vasculature, connective tissues and central nervous system. At present, the crystal structure of CBS from Drosophila melanogaster is the only available structure of the full-length enzyme. Here we describe a cloning, overexpression, purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of a full-length CBS from Apis mellifera (AmCBS) which maintains 51 and 46% sequence identity with its Drosophila and human homologs, respectively. The AmCBS yielded crystals belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=85.90, b=95.87, c=180.33 Å. Diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 3.0 Å. The crystal structure contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit which presumably correspond to the dimeric species observed in solution.</p>

<p>Human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent hemeprotein, whose catalytic activity is regulated by S-adenosylmethionine. CBS catalyzes the ß-replacement reaction of homocysteine (Hcy) with serine to yield cystathionine. CBS is a key regulator of plasma levels of the thrombogenic Hcy and deficiency in CBS is the single most common cause of homocystinuria, an inherited metabolic disorder of sulfur amino acids. The properties of CBS enzymes, such as domain organization, oligomerization degree or regulatory mechanisms, are not conserved across the eukaryotes. The current body of knowledge is insufficient to understand these differences and their impact on CBS function and physiology. To overcome this deficiency, we have addressed the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of a protein construct (hCBS516-525) that contains the full-length CBS from Homo sapiens (hCBS) and just lacks amino-acid residues 516-525, which are located in a disordered loop. The human enzyme yielded crystals belonging to space group I222, with unit-cell parameters a=124.98, b=136.33, c=169.83 Å and diffracting X-rays to a resolution of 3.0 Å.

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, which is critical for the synthesis of cysteine from methionine in eukaryotes. CBS uses coenzyme pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) for catalysis, and S-adenosylmethionine regulates the activity of human CBS, but not yeast CBS. Human and fruit fly CBS contain heme; however, the role for heme is not clear. This paper reports biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of CBS from fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (DmCBS) and the CO/NO gas binding reactions of DmCBS and human CBS. Like CBS enzymes from lower organisms (e.g., yeast), DmCBS is intrinsically highly active and is not regulated by AdoMet. The DmCBS heme coordination environment, the reactivity, and the accompanying effects on enzyme activity are similar to those of human CBS. The DmCBS heme bears histidine and cysteine axial ligands, and the enzyme becomes inactive when the cysteine ligand is replaced. The Fe(II) heme in DmCBS is less stable than that in human CBS, undergoing more facile reoxidation and ligand exchange. In both CBS proteins, the overall stability of the protein is correlated with the heme oxidation state. Human and DmCBS Fe(II) hemes react relatively slowly with CO and NO, and the rate of the CO binding reaction is faster at low pH than at high pH. Together, the results suggest that heme incorporation and AdoMet regulation in CBS are not correlated, possibly providing two independent means for regulating the enzyme.</p>

<p>CBS (cystathionine ß-synthase) is a multidomain tetrameric enzyme essential in the regulation of homocysteine metabolism, whose activity is enhanced by the allosteric regulator SAM (S-adenosylmethionine). Missense mutations in CBS are the major cause of inherited HCU (homocystinuria). In the present study we apply a novel approach based on a combination of calorimetric methods, functional assays and kinetic modelling to provide structural and energetic insight into the effects of SAM on the stability and activity of WT (wild-type) CBS and seven HCU-causing mutants. We found two sets of SAM-binding sites in the C-terminal regulatory domain with different structural and energetic features: a high affinity set of two sites, probably involved in kinetic stabilization of the regulatory domain, and a low affinity set of four sites, which are involved in the enzyme activation. We show that the regulatory domain displays a low kinetic stability in WT CBS, which is further decreased in many HCU-causing mutants. We propose that the SAM-induced stabilization may play a key role in modulating steady-state levels of WT and mutant CBS in vivo. Our strategy may be valuable for understanding ligand effects on proteins with a complex architecture and their role in human genetic diseases and for the development of novel pharmacological strategies.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is an essential pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway that condenses serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine; intriguingly, human CBS also contains a heme b cofactor of unknown function. Herein we describe the enzymatic and spectroscopic properties of a disease-associated R266K hCBS variant, which has an altered hydrogen-bonding environment. The R266K hCBS contains a low-spin, six-coordinate Fe(III) heme bearing a His/Cys ligation motif, like that of WT hCBS; however, there is a geometric distortion that exists at the R266K heme. Using rR spectroscopy, we show that the Fe(III)-Cys(thiolate) bond is longer and weaker in R266K, as evidenced by an 8 cm(-1) downshift in the <U+03BD>(Fe-S) resonance. Presence of this longer and weaker Fe(III)-Cys(thiolate) bond is correlated with alteration of the fluorescence spectrum of the active PLP ketoenamine tautomer. Activity data demonstrate that, relative to WT, the R266K variant is more impaired in the alternative cysteine-synthesis reaction than in the canonical cystathionine-synthesis reaction. This diminished cysteine synthesis activity and a greater sensitivity to exogenous PLP correlate with the change in PLP environment. Fe-S(Cys) bond weakening causes a nearly 300-fold increase in the rate of ligand switching upon reduction of the R266K heme. Combined, these data demonstrate cross talk between the heme and PLP active sites, consistent with previous proposals, revealing that alteration of the Arg(266)-Cys(52) interaction affects PLP-dependent activity and dramatically destabilizes the ferrous thiolate-ligated heme complex, underscoring the importance of this hydrogen-bonding residue pair.</p>

These purified mutants exhibited full heme saturation, normal tetrameric assembly, and high catalytic activity. In this work, we used several spectroscopic and proteolytic techniques to provide a more thorough insight into the conformation of these mutant enzymes. Far-UV circular dichroism, fluorescence, and second-derivative UV spectroscopy revealed that the spatial arrangement of these CBS mutants is similar to that of the wild type, although the microenvironment of the chromophores may be slightly altered. Using proteolysis with thermolysin under native conditions, we found that the majority of the studied mutants is more susceptible to cleavage, suggesting their increased local flexibility or propensity for local unfolding. Interestingly, the presence of the CBS allosteric activator, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), increased the rate of cleavage of the wild type and the AdoMet-responsive mutants, while the proteolytic rate of the AdoMet-unresponsive mutants was not significantly changed. Pulse proteolysis analysis suggested that the protein structure of the R125Q and E176K mutants is significantly less stable than that of the wild type and the other mutants. Taken together, the proteolytic data shows that the conformation of the pathogenic mutants is altered despite retained catalytic activity and normal tetrameric assembly. This study demonstrates that the proteolytic techniques are useful tools for the assessment of the biochemical penalty of missense mutations in CBS.</p>

<p>Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), a heme-containing pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to yield cystathionine. Missense mutations in CBS, the most common cause of homocystinuria, often result in misfolded proteins. Arginine 266, where the pathogenic missense mutation R266K was identified, appears to be involved in the communication between heme and the PLP-containing catalytic center. Here, we assessed the effect of a short affinity tag (6xHis) compared to a bulky fusion partner (glutathione S-transferase - GST) on CBS wild type (WT) and R266K mutant enzyme properties. While WT CBS was successfully expressed either in conjunction with a GST or with a 6xHis tag, the mutant R266K CBS had no activity, did not form native tetramers and did not respond to chemical chaperone treatment when expressed with a GST fusion partner. Interestingly, expression of R266K CBS constructs with a 6xHis tag at either end yielded active enzymes. The purified, predominantly tetrameric, R266K CBS with a C-terminal 6xHis tag had ~82% of the activity of a corresponding WT CBS construct. Results from thermal pre-treatment of the enzyme and the denaturation profile of R266K suggests a lower thermal stability of the mutant enzyme compared to WT, presumably due to a disturbed heme environment.</p>

<p>Human cystathionine ß-synthase (hCBS), a key enzyme in the trans-sulfuration pathway, catalyzes the condensation of serine with homocysteine to produce cystathionine. CBS from higher organisms is the only known protein that binds pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) and heme. Intriguingly, the function of the heme in hCBS has yet to be elucidated. Herein, we describe the characterization of a cobalt-substituted variant of hCBS (Co hCBS) in which CoPPIX replaces FePPIX (heme). Co(III) hCBS is a unique Co-substituted heme protein: the Co(III) ion is 6-coordinate, low-spin, diamagnetic, and bears a cysteine(thiolate) as one of its axial ligands. The peak positions and intensities of the electronic absorption and MCD spectra of Co(III) hCBS are distinct from those of previously Co-substituted heme proteins; TD-DFT calculations reveal that the unique features arise from the 6-coordinate Co bound axially by cysteine(thiolate) and a neutral donor, presumably histidine. Reactivity of Co(III) hCBS with HgCl(2) is consistent with a loss of the cysteine(thiolate) ligand. Co(III) hCBS is slowly reduced to Co(II) hCBS, which contains a 5-coordinate, low-spin, S = 1/2 Co-porphyrin that does not retain the cysteine(thiolate) ligand; this form of Co(II) hCBS binds NO((g)) but not CO((g)). Co(II) hCBS is reoxidized in the air to form a new Co(III) form, which does not contain a cysteine(thiolate) ligand. Canonical and alternative CBS assays suggest that maintaining the native heme ligation motif of wild-type Fe hCBS (Cys/His) is essential in maintaining maximal activity in Co hCBS. Correlation between the coordination structures and enzyme activity in both native Fe and Co-substituted proteins implicates a structural role for the heme in CBS.</p>

<p>Human electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) is a soluble mitochondrial heterodimeric flavoprotein that links fatty acid ß-oxidation to the main respiratory chain. The crystal structure of human ETF bound to medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase indicates that the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domain (aII) is mobile, which permits more rapid electron transfer with donors and acceptors by providing closer access to the flavin and allows ETF to accept electrons from at least 10 different flavoprotein dehydrogenases. Sequence homology is high and low-angle X-ray scattering is identical for Paracoccus denitrificans (P. denitrificans) and human ETF. To characterize the orientations of the aII domain of P. denitrificans ETF, distances between enzymatically reduced FAD and spin labels in the three structural domains were measured by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) at X- and Q-bands. An FAD to spin label distance of 2.8 ± 0.15 nm for the label in the FAD-containing aII domain (A210C) agreed with estimates from the crystal structure (3.0 nm), molecular dynamics simulations (2.7 nm), and rotamer library analysis (2.8 nm). Distances between the reduced FAD and labels in aI (A43C) were between 4.0 and 4.5 ± 0.35 nm and for ßIII (A111C) the distance was 4.3 ± 0.15 nm. These values were intermediate between estimates from the crystal structure of P. denitrificans ETF and a homology model based on substrate-bound human ETF. These distances suggest that the aII domain adopts orientations in solution that are intermediate between those which are observed in the crystal structures of free ETF (closed) and ETF bound to a dehydrogenase (open).</p>

<p>Human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), a pivotal enzyme in the metabolism of homocysteine, is a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate-dependent enzyme that also contains heme, a second cofactor whose function is still unclear. One strategy for elucidation of heme function is its replacement with different metalloporphyrins or with porphyrins containing different substituent groups. This paper describes a novel expression approach and purification of cobalt CBS (CoCBS), which results in a high yield of fully active, high purity enzyme, in which heme is substituted by Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX). Metal content analysis showed that the enzyme contained 92% cobalt and 8% iron. CoCBS was indistinguishable from wild-type FeCBS in its activity, tetrameric oligomerization, PLP saturation and responsiveness to the allosteric activator, S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The observed biochemical and spectral characteristics of CoCBS provide further support for the suggestion that heme is involved in structural integrity and folding of this unusual enzyme.</p>

<p>Toxicity in Escherichia coli resulting from high concentrations of cobalt has been explained by competition of cobalt with iron in various metabolic processes including Fe-S cluster assembly, sulfur assimilation, production of free radicals and reduction of free thiol pool. Here we present another aspect of increased cobalt concentrations in the culture medium resulting in the production of cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX), which was incorporated into heme proteins including membrane-bound cytochromes and an expressed human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). The presence of CoPPIX in cytochromes inhibited their electron transport capacity and resulted in a substantially decreased respiration. Bacterial cells adapted to the increased cobalt concentration by inducing a modified mixed acid fermentative pathway under aerobiosis. We capitalized on the ability of E. coli to insert cobalt into PPIX to carry out an expression of CoPPIX-substituted heme proteins. The level of CoPPIX-substitution increased with the number of passages of cells in a cobalt-containing medium. This approach is an inexpensive method to prepare cobalt-substituted heme proteins compared to in vitro enzyme reconstitution or in vivo replacement using metalloporphyrin heme analogs and seems to be especially suitable for complex heme proteins with an additional coenzyme, such as human CBS.</p>

<p>Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains of particular phage types, such as DT104, U302, DT120, DT193, and nontypable strains, are often characterized by resistance to multiple antibiotics. This antibiotic resistance can be caused by the presence of the integrons, transposons, Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), or conjugative plasmids. In this study we were interested in the relative contribution of integrons and SGI1 to the antibiotic resistance of the four mentioned phage types and nontypable S. Typhimurium human strains. Altogether 193 isolates were characterized for antibiotic susceptibility, presence of class 1 integrons, and the left junction of SGI1. Based on the presence of class 1 integrons and the left junction of SGI1, all strains could be clustered into three groups. The first group consisted of 69 strains positive for both the class 1 integrons and the left junction of SGI1. The strains of this group belonged mainly to DT104, U302, and DT120 phage types with resistance phenotype ACSSuT or ACSSuTNA. The second group comprised 9 strains which were positive only for the presence of class 1 integrons. In this group were some strains of multiple-antibiotic-resistant phage types: DT120, DT193, U302; and nontypable. The third group consisted of 115 strains in which neither the class 1 integrons nor the left junction of SGI1 were detected. Although the isolates were resistant to 2-8 antibiotics, the most frequent resistance type of these strains were ASSuT and SSu. By nucleotide sequencing of class 1 integrons PCR amplicons, the following embedded gene cassettes were determined: aadA1, aadA2, aadA5, aadA7, bla(PSE-1), sat1, dfrA1; and dfrA14. Our study shows a high prevalence and diversity of class 1 integrons embedded antimicrobial gene cassettes and their strong association with SGI1.</p>

<p>Missense mutations represent the most common cause of many genetic diseases including cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency. Many of these mutations result in misfolded proteins, which lack biological function. The presence of chemical chaperones can sometimes alleviate or even restore protein folding and activity of mutant proteins. We present the purification and characterization of eight CBS mutants expressed in the presence of chemical chaperones such as ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, or trimethylamine-N-oxide. Preliminary screening in Escherichia coli crude extracts showed that their presence during protein expression had a significant impact on the amount of recovered CBS protein, formation of tetramers, and catalytic activity. Subsequently, we purified eight CBS mutants to homogeneity (P49L, P78R, A114V, R125Q, E176K, P422L, I435T, and S466L). The tetrameric mutant enzymes fully saturated with heme had the same or higher specific activities than wild type CBS. Thermal stability measurements demonstrated that the purified mutants are equally or more thermostable than wild type CBS. The response to S-adenosyl-L-methionine stimulation or thermal activation varied. The lack of response of R125Q and E176K to both stimuli indicated that their specific conformations were unable to reach the activated state. Increased levels of molecular chaperones in crude extracts, particularly DnaJ, indicated a rather indirect effect of the chemical chaperones on folding of CBS mutants. In conclusion, the chemical chaperones present in the expression medium were able to fully restore the activity of eight CBS mutants by improving their protein folding. This finding could have direct implications for the development of a therapeutical approach to pyridoxine unresponsive homocystinuria.</p>

<p>The human mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) accepts electrons from at least 10 different flavoprotein dehydrogenases and transfers electrons to a single electron acceptor in the inner membrane. Paracoccus denitrificans ETF has the identical function, shares the same three-dimensional structure and functional domains, and exhibits the same conformational mobility. It has been proposed that the mobility of the alphaII domain permits the promiscuous behavior of ETF with respect to a variety of redox partners. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measurements between a spin label and an enzymatically reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor in P. denitrificans ETF gave two distributions of distances: a major component centered at 4.2 +/- 0.1 nm and a minor component centered at 5.1 +/- 0.2 nm. Both components had widths of approximately 0.3 nm. A distance of 4.1 nm was calculated using the crystal structure of P. denitrificans ETF, which agrees with the major component obtained from the DEER measurement. The observation of a second distribution suggests that ETF, in the absence of substrate, adopts some conformations that are intermediate between the predominant free and substrate-bound states.</p>

<p>Honey has been used since ancient times as a remedy in wound healing. However, even though the results from randomized clinical trials document that honey accelerates wound healing, no study dealing with its influence on human skin cells (epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblast) has been performed. We demonstrate that keratinocytes, which are known to be involved in wound healing, are responsible for elevated production of mediators including cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and TGF-beta) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) after incubation with honey. Real-time PCR was performed for the quantification of mRNA level of selected cytokines and MMP-9. Furthermore, we show that the increased level of MMP-9 in the epidermis following incubation with honey leads to degradation of type IV collagen in the basement membrane. These data indisputably demonstrate that honey activates keratinocytes and support the findings that honey may accelerate wound healing process.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme in the metabolism of homocysteine, has previously been shown to require a heme co-factor for maximal activity. However, the biochemical function of the CBS heme is not well defined. Here, we show that expression of human CBS in heme-deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli results in production of an enzyme that is misfolded and degraded. Addition of exogenous heme, porphyrins with non-iron metal, or porphyrin lacking metal entirely produced stable and active CBS enzyme. Purification of recombinant CBS enzyme expressed in the presence of various metalloporphyrins confirmed that Mn(III) and Co(III) had 30-60% of the specific activity of Fe(III)-CBS, and still responded to allosteric activation by S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Treatment of S. cerevisiae with the chemical chaperone trimethylamine-N-oxide resulted in near complete restoration of function to human CBS produced in a heme-deficient strain. Taken together, these results suggest that porphyrin moiety of the heme plays a critical role in proper CBS folding and assembly, but that the metal ion is not essential for this function or for allosteric regulation by S-adenosyl-L-methionine.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: To characterize and subtype multidrug-resistant Salmonella isolates by determining the virulence factors, prophage sequences and antimicrobial resistance genes using a novel Salmonella-specific oligonucleotide microarray.METHODS: Preliminary screening of 24 Salmonella clinical isolates was carried out by using susceptibility testing, plasmid profiling and class 1 integron PCR. Subsequently, oligonucleotide microarray was involved in genotypic characterization and localization of monitored genetic markers. The presence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also detected and confirmed by PCR and subsequent sequencing. The potential spread of emerging bla(SHV-2) was investigated by bacterial conjugation.RESULTS: All Salmonella strains revealed resistance to two or more (up to nine) antibiotics. Nineteen of them carried class 1 integrons including dfrA1, dfrA12, aadA1, aadA2, bla(PSE-1) and bla(TEM-1) gene cassettes, respectively. Twenty-three out of 24 Salmonella isolates possessed one or more plasmids. Oligonucleotide microarray characterization and typing revealed the conserved character of Salmonella pathogenicity island virulence factors among three Salmonella enterica serovars, significant variability in prophage sequences and many different antimicrobial resistance gene patterns. Differential labelling of genomic and plasmid DNA, respectively, and hybridization to the microarray made it possible to localize important resistance determinants. Microarray results were successfully confirmed and verified by using PCR. The emerging bla(SHV-2) gene from Salmonella Kentucky SK10944 conferring resistance to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime was transferred via bacterial conjugation to Escherichia coli K-12 3110.CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella isolates were quickly and thoroughly characterized by a novel oligonucleotide microarray, which could become a useful tool for detection of virulence and resistance genes and monitoring of their dissemination among salmonellae and closely related bacteria.</p>

The original isolate of this serovar was associated with travel to Egypt, and the emergence of other isolates was due to the nosocomial spread of this strain in two hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, class I integrons content, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis and plasmid DNA profiles were performed on all isolates. A high proportion (89.7%) of the isolates was multidrug-resistant, while 67 strains expressed resistance against ciprofloxacin. By sequence analysis of randomly selected strains, the point mutations in quinolone resistance-determining region of the DNA gyrase were found. The S.

<p>Global gene expression profiling of bacteriophage BFK20 infecting the industrial L-lysine producer Brevibacterium flavum CCM 251 was performed using DNA microarray. The relative gene expressions were measured in fourteen time samples collected during phage development. Phage genes were classified as early, middle, late or unassigned based on complex expression patterns during infection. Temporal classification of BFK20 genes was in concordance with previous predictions. However, proposed late regulatory genes were reclassified and new functional assignments for ORF55 were strongly suggested. Furthermore, we consider possible functions of other genes and their products regarding coexpression pattern by using “guilt-by-association” algorithm. Microarray results were validated using real-time RT-PCR. The detailed description of phage BFK20 transcriptional profile can answer the basic questions of its life cycle and it also can help to prevent phage contamination during industrial fermentation. In addition, this work presents the first complete microarray time course study of gene expression utilizing loop design.</p>

<p>Genome projects produce a huge amount of sequence information. As a result, the focus of genomics research is turning toward deduction of functional information about newly discovered genes. Thus structural genomics paves the way for a new discipline called functional genomics by providing the information required for microarray manufacture. Microarray technology is the result of automation and miniaturization in the detection of differential gene expression. By using this technology one can make a parallel analysis of RNA abundance and DNA homology for thousands of genes in a single experiment. Over the past several years, this unique technology has been used to explore hundreds transcriptional patterns and genome differences for a variety of microbial species. Applications of microarrays extend beyond the boundaries of basic biology into diagnostics, environmental monitoring, pharmacology, toxicology and biotechnology. We describe comprehensive nature of DNA microarray technology with emphasis on fabrication of DNA microarrays and application of this technology in biological environment with primary accent on microbial systems.</p>

<p>AIMS: Defence mechanisms of the corynebacterial strains against corynephage BFK 20, which causes lysis of Brevibacterium flavum CCM 251.METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested adsorption of the phage BFK 20 to the corynebacterial cell surface. We observed strong adsorption ranging from ca 79 to 93% on the cells of B. flavum ATCC strains, but only ca 76% for B. flavum CCM 251. Minor adsorption for Brevibacterium lactofermentum BLOB (ca 13%) and no adsorption for Corynebacterium glutamicum RM3 were determined. BFK 20 infection had no significant effect on growth and viability of C. glutamicum and B. lactofermentum, but significantly influenced growth and viability of B. flavum ATCC 21127, 21128 and 21474. Cell growth stopped in short time after infection but with no lysis. Brevibacterium flavum CCM 251 cell growth was arrested too and lysis occurred. The Southern hybridization confirmed the presence of significant amount of BFK 20 DNA in samples from B. flavum CCM 251 and B. flavum ATCC strains after BFK 20 infection. Only weak hybridization signal was detected for DNA from infected cells of B. lactofermentum BLOB and no signal for C. glutamicum RM3.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above results we suggest presence of a mechanism leading to abortive infection in B. flavum ATCC 21127, 21128 and 21474. In B. lactofermentum BLOB and C. glutamicum RM3 the adsorption barrier is more likely.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study increases the knowledge on defence mechanisms of corynebacteria against bacteriophages.</p>
