<h4>Immune-Deficient Pfp/Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> Mice Featured Higher Adipose Tissue Mass and Liver Lipid Accumulation with Growing Age than Wildtype C57BL/6N Mice.</h4>

<p>Aging is a risk factor for adipose tissue dysfunction, which is associated with inflammatory innate immune mechanisms. Since the adipose tissue/liver axis contributes to hepatosteatosis, we sought to determine age-related adipose tissue dysfunction in the context of the activation of the innate immune system fostering fatty liver phenotypes. Using wildtype and immune-deficient mice, we compared visceral adipose tissue and liver mass as well as hepatic lipid storage in young (ca. 14 weeks) and adult (ca. 30 weeks) mice. Adipocyte size was determined as an indicator of adipocyte function and liver steatosis was quantified by hepatic lipid content. Further, lipid storage was investigated under normal and steatosis-inducing culture conditions in isolated hepatocytes. The physiological age-related increase in body weight was associated with a disproportionate increase in adipose tissue mass in immune-deficient mice, which coincided with higher triglyceride storage in the liver. Lipid storage was similar in isolated hepatocytes from wildtype and immune-deficient mice under normal culture conditions but was significantly higher in immune-deficient than in wildtype hepatocytes under steatosis-inducing culture conditions. Immune-deficient mice also displayed increased inflammatory, adipogenic, and lipogenic markers in serum and adipose tissue. Thus, the age-related increase in body weight coincided with an increase in adipose tissue mass and hepatic steatosis. In association with a (pro-)inflammatory milieu, aging thus promotes hepatosteatosis, especially in immune-deficient mice.</p>

<p>Hydrogel fibers are structurally and biologically useful devices for differentiation of stem cells and fabrication of filament-like tissues. We established cell-laden degradable hydrogel fibers through visible light-initiated crosslinking to differentiate stem cells and fabricate filament-like tissue. Human adipose stem cell (hADSC)-laden fibers were fabricated by cross-linking phenolic-substituted alginate and gelatin (Alg-Ph and Gela-Ph respectively) in an aqueous solution containing cells. The crosslinking of phenolic moieties was mediated by ruthenium(II) tris-bipyridyl dication (Ru(II) bpy and sodium ammonium persulfate (SPS) and irradiating visible light. The hydrogel microfiber fabricated with desirable geometries and dimensions. The encapsulated hADSCs proliferated and grew within hydrogel microfiber, maintained their multipotency ability and formed filament-like constructs. The filament-like tissues covered with an additional heterogeneous cell layer was made by degrading the fiber membrane using alginate-lyase after covering the fiber surface with vascular endothelial cells. Cellular viability is preserved during Alg-Ph and Gela-Ph hydrogel fiber fabrication and filament-like tissue formation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of Alg-based hydrogel fibers obtained through the Ru/SPS-mediated crosslinking system and visible light irradiation for the engineering of filament-like tissues and cell-based therapeutic treatments.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cluster analyses have proposed different diabetes phenotypes using age, BMI, glycaemia, homoeostasis model estimates, and islet autoantibodies. We tested whether comprehensive phenotyping validates and further characterises these clusters at diagnosis and whether relevant diabetes-related complications differ among these clusters, during 5-years of follow-up.METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the German Diabetes Study underwent comprehensive phenotyping and assessment of laboratory variables. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps, hepatocellular lipid content using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, hepatic fibrosis using non-invasive scores, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathy using functional and clinical criteria. Patients were reassessed after 5 years. The German Diabetes Study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01055093, and is ongoing.FINDINGS: 1105 patients were classified at baseline into five clusters, with 386 (35%) assigned to mild age-related diabetes (MARD), 323 (29%) to mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), 247 (22%) to severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID), 121 (11%) to severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), and 28 (3%) to severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD). At 5-year follow-up, 367 patients were reassessed, 128 (35%) with MARD, 106 (29%) with MOD, 88 (24%) with SAID, 35 (10%) with SIRD, and ten (3%) with SIDD. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was lowest in patients with SIRD at baseline (mean 4·3 mg/kg per min [SD 2·0]) compared with those with SAID (8·4 mg/kg per min [3·2]; p&lt;0·0001), MARD (7·5 mg/kg per min [2·5]; p&lt;0·0001), MOD (6·6 mg/kg per min [2·6]; p=0·0011), and SIDD (5·5 mg/kg per min [2·4]; p=0·0035). The fasting adipose-tissue insulin resistance index at baseline was highest in patients with SIRD (median 15·6 [IQR 9·3-20·9]) and MOD (11·6 [7·4-17·9]) compared with those with MARD (6·0 [3·9-10·3]; both p&lt;0·0001) and SAID (6·0 [3·0-9·5]; both p&lt;0·0001). In patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, hepatocellular lipid content was highest at baseline in patients assigned to the SIRD cluster (median 19% [IQR 11-22]) compared with all other clusters (7% [2-15] for MOD, p=0·00052; 5% [2-11] for MARD, p&lt;0·0001; 2% [0-13] for SIDD, p=0·0083; and 1% [0-3] for SAID, p&lt;0·0001), even after adjustments for baseline medication. Accordingly, hepatic fibrosis at 5-year follow-up was more prevalent in patients with SIRD (n=7 [26%]) than in patients with SAID (n=5 [7%], p=0·0011), MARD (n=12 [12%], p=0·012), MOD (n=13 [15%], p=0·050), and SIDD (n=0 [0%], p value not available). Confirmed diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy was more prevalent at baseline in patients with SIDD (n=9 [36%]) compared with patients with SAID (n=10 [5%], p&lt;0·0001), MARD (n=39 [15%], p=0·00066), MOD (n=26 [11%], p&lt;0·0001), and SIRD (n=10 [17%], p&lt;0·0001).INTERPRETATION: Cluster analysis can characterise cohorts with different degrees of whole-body and adipose-tissue insulin resistance. Specific diabetes clusters show different prevalence of diabetes complications at early stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetic neuropathy. These findings could help improve targeted prevention and treatment and enable precision medicine for diabetes and its comorbidities.FUNDING: German Diabetes Center, German Federal Ministry of Health, Ministry of Culture and Science of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, German Diabetes Association, German Center for Diabetes Research, Research Network SFB 1116 of the German Research Foundation, and Schmutzler Stiftung.</p>

<p>SCOPE: Obesity is a principal causative factor of metabolic syndrome. Niacin potently regulates lipid metabolism. Replacement of SFAs by MUFAs or inclusion of omega-3 long-chain PUFAs in diet improves plasma lipid levels. However, the potential benefits of niacin in combination with MUFAs or omega-3 long-chain PUFAs against white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction in the high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome are unknown.CONCLUSION: Niacin in combination with dietary MUFAs can favor WAT homeostasis in the development of HFD-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome.

<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a vital role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, most studies ascribed the function of PVAT in vascular remodeling to adipokines secreted by the perivascular adipocytes. Whether mesenchymal stem cells exist in PVAT and play a role in vascular regeneration remain unknown. Approach and Results: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allowed direct visualization of the heterogeneous PVAT-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PV-ADSCs) at a high resolution and revealed 2 distinct subpopulations, among which one featured signaling pathways crucial for smooth muscle differentiation. Pseudotime analysis of cultured PV-ADSCs unraveled their smooth muscle differentiation trajectory. Transplantation of cultured PV-ADSCs in mouse vein graft model suggested the contribution of PV-ADSCs to vascular remodeling through smooth muscle differentiation. Mechanistically, treatment with TGF-ß1 (transforming growth factor ß1) and transfection of microRNA (miR)-378a-3p mimics induced a similar metabolic reprogramming of PV-ADSCs, including upregulated mitochondrial potential and altered lipid levels, such as increased cholesterol and promoted smooth muscle differentiation.CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allows direct visualization of PV-ADSC heterogeneity at a single-cell level and uncovers 2 subpopulations with distinct signature genes and signaling pathways. The function of PVAT in vascular regeneration is partly attributed to PV-ADSCs and their differentiation towards smooth muscle lineage. Mechanistic study presents miR-378a-3p which is a potent regulator of metabolic reprogramming as a potential therapeutic target for vascular regeneration.</p>

<p>The following case studies describe the use of the Smith Medical implanted ports and Gripper huber needles. Smiths Medical produces a range of implanted ports that include the Port-A-Cath and P.A.S. Port Power P.A.C. systems. The ports are easy to implant, maintain and remove. They are lightweight and have features that are designed to reduce complication rates, including a highly compressed septum to increase needle retention, a titanium chamber with a gouge-resistant floor, a bevelled chamber for optimal rinsing, a round shape to avoid overturning and the Ultralock connection. They are available in various configurations, with single and dual lumens. There is also a needle for power-injection of contrast media for certain types of diagnostic imaging scans (Smith Medical 18). The Gripper Plus needle is designed with an emphasis on safety, effectiveness and patient comfort. These non-coring needles have a bevelled tip that sits flush with the back of the port without impeding the flow of fluid; this also prevents holes forming in the septum (Barton et al, 2018). The needle is available in different gauges and lengths, which can be tailored to reflect individual patient needs and the amount of adipose tissue present. It is essential to select the correct size, which will reduce the risk of dislodgement. The Gripper needles are compatible with paclitaxel and lipid solutions, and are recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (1999). They are compatible with both the Port-a-Cath and P.A.S. Port Power P.A.C. systems, and can be ordered from the same manufacturer, which has the potential to make ordering, training and support more efficient.</p>

<p>Obesity is increasingly prevalent and is associated with substantial cardiovascular risk. Adipose tissue distribution and morphology play a key role in determining the degree of adverse effects, and a key factor in the disease process appears to be the inflammatory cell population in adipose tissue. Healthy adipose tissue secretes a number of vasoactive adipokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and changes to this secretory profile will contribute to pathogenesis in obesity. In this review, we discuss the links between adipokine dysregulation and the development of hypertension and diabetes and explore the potential for manipulating adipose tissue morphology and its immune cell population to improve cardiovascular health in obesity.</p>

<p>Polyurethane foam (PU foam) is a new material which is being used in producing both macro-anatomical and micro-anatomical specimens. PU foam is simple to use, without need for special equipment. The present study was carried out to evaluate morphology of coronary sinus and its tributaries. During the study, we encountered few problems in carrying out injections. Coronary sinus and its tributaries were difficult to cannulate since the coronary sinus lacks a vascular stem, around which ligature can be tied before injection so that the cannula can be held in place. In contrast, in majority of the organs it is easy to inject since they possess tubular vascular stem to hold the cannula in place. A new device was developed which could be used to cannulate coronary sinus orifice to inject the casting media. The second problem we faced was saponification of adipose tissue. This made corrosion of the soft tissue difficult. Hence in this study, we describe the device we have developed to place in the coronary sinus orifice, and how saponified adipose tissue was taken care during the actual maceration step.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Polarized macrophage populations can orchestrate both inflammation of the kidney and tissue repair during CKD. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages initiate kidney injury, but mechanisms through which persistent M1-dependent kidney damage culminates in fibrosis require elucidation. Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc-finger transcription factor that suppresses inflammatory signals, is an essential regulator of macrophage polarization in adipose tissues, but the effect of myeloid KLF4 on CKD progression is unknown.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that macrophage KLF4 ameliorates CKD by mitigating TNF-dependent injury and fibrosis.</p>

<p>Experimental and human autopsy studies have associated adventitial lymphangiogenesis with atherosclerosis. An analysis of perivascular lymphangiogenesis in patients with coronary artery disease is lacking. Here, we examined lymphangiogenesis and its potential regulators in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding the heart (C-PVAT) and compared it with PVAT of the internal mammary artery (IMA-PVAT). Forty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were included. Perioperatively collected C-PVAT and IMA-PVAT were analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, real time PCR, and PVAT-conditioned medium using cytokine arrays. C-PVAT exhibited increased PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1)-positive vessel density. The number of lymphatic vessels expressing lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 or podoplanin was also elevated in C-PVAT and associated with higher inflammatory cell numbers, increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, and fibrosis. Significantly higher expression of regulators of lymphangiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF receptor-3 was observed in C-PVAT compared to IMA-PVAT. Cytokine arrays identified angiopoietin-2 as more highly expressed in C-PVAT vs. IMA-PVAT. Findings were confirmed histologically and at the mRNA level. Stimulation of human lymphatic endothelial cells with recombinant angiopoietin-2 in combination with VEGF-C enhanced sprout formation. Our study shows that PVAT surrounding atherosclerotic arteries exhibits more extensive lymphangiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis compared to PVAT surrounding a non-diseased vessel, possibly due to local angiopoietin-2, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D overexpression.</p>

<p>The immunogenic collagen V (Col V) and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases. Col V is also up-regulated during adipogenesis and can stimulate adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Conditioned medium (CM) generated from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduces bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury in rats, suggesting a crucial role in situ of immunomodulatory factors secreted by MSCs in these beneficial effects. In the present work, we investigated this hypothesis, analyzing levels of plasma inflammatory mediators and inflammatory and fibrotic mediators in the lung tissue of BLM-injured rats after treatment with MSCs and CM. Pulmonary fibrosis was intratracheally induced by BLM. After 10 days, BLM animals were further randomized into subgroups receiving saline, MSCs, or CM intravenously. On days 14 and 21, the animals were euthanized, and the lungs were examined through protein expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), IL-17, transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß), vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin-1, and the immunogenic Col V through histological quantitative evaluation and plasma levels of fibrinogen, Von Willebrand factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Rats that had been injected with MSCs and CM showed a significant increase in weight and significant improvements at 14 and 21 days after intravenous injection at both time points of analysis of plasma fibrinogen, PDGF, and Von Willebrand factor and NOS-2 expression, supporting an early anti-inflammatory action, thus reducing TGF-ß and collagen I fibers. In contrast, intravenous injection of CM was able to significantly increase the deposition of Col V fibers and IL-17 on both day 14 and day 21 as compared with the amount observed in rats from the BLM group and MSC groups. In conclusion, this study reinforces previous observations on the therapeutic properties of MSCs and CM and is the first report to demonstrate the association of its actions with immunomodulatory biomarkers on lung tissue. We concluded that adipose-derived stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells-CM modulate an in situ imbalance between collagen I- and Col V-mediated IL-17 immune response, emerging as a promising therapeutic option for recovering from BLM pulmonary fibrosis.</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS: To treat obesity and related diseases, considerable effort has gone into developing strategies to convert white adipocytes into thermogenic brown-like adipocytes (‘browning’). The purpose of this study was to identify the most efficient signal control for browning.METHODS: To identify the most efficient signal control for browning, we examined rat stromal vascular fraction cells. In addition, physiological changes consequent to signal control were examined in vivo using lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice.RESULTS: Combined treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) agonist rosiglitazone, the SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3 and the adrenergic receptor agonist noradrenaline (norepinephrine) synergistically induced Ucp1, Fgf21 and Cited1 expression, triggering brown adipogenesis. Synergistic induction of Ucp1 by the three agents was negatively regulated by forkhead box O (FOXO)3 via the inhibition of PPAR<U+03B3>-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, the administration of rosiglitazone, SIS3 and the selective ß3 adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 to DIO mice reduced the amount of body-fat deposits (body weight from day 0 to 14, 12.3% reduction), concomitant with morphological changes in white adipose tissue, an increase in mitochondrial biosynthesis and a marked induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Furthermore, administration of the three agents significantly increased serum adiponectin levels (mean 65.56 µg/ml with the three agents vs 20.79 µg/ml in control mice, p &lt;<U+2009>0.05) and improved glucose and lipid tolerance.INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the combined regulation of PPAR<U+03B3>, SMAD and the adrenergic receptor signalling pathway synergistically induces brown adipogenesis and may serve as an effective strategy to treat obesity and related diseases, including type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: Lowering of LDL cholesterol levels by plant sterols and stanols is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. Plant sterols and stanols also lower triacylglycerol (TG). However, it is not fully understood how reduction in TG is achieved and what the full potential of plant sterols and stanols is on whole-body metabolism. We here hypothesize that high levels of plant sterols and stanols stimulate whole-body energy expenditure, which can be attributed to changes in mitochondrial function of brown adipose tissue (BAT), skeletal muscle and liver.METHODS: Phytosterolemic mice were fed chow diets for 32 weeks to examine whole-body weight gain. In vitro, 24-h incubation were performed in adipocytes derived from human BAT, human myotubes or HepG2 human hepatocytes using sitosterol or sitostanol. Following mitochondrial function was assessed using seahorse bioanalyzer.RESULTS: Chow feeding in phytosterolemic mice resulted in diminished increase in body weight compared to control mice. In vitro, sitosterol or sitostanol did not change mitochondrial function in adipocytes derived from human BAT or in cultured human myotubes. Interestingly, maximal mitochondrial function in HepG2 human hepatocytes was decreased following sitosterol or sitostanol incubation, however, only when mitochondrial function was assessed in low glucose-containing medium.CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial in vivo effects of plant sterols and stanols on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are well recognized. Our results indicate that alterations in human mitochondrial function are apparently not involved to explain these beneficial effects.</p>

<p>Targeting residual cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention, would allow deployment of novel therapeutic agents, facilitating precision medicine. For example, lowering vascular inflammation is a promising strategy to reduce the residual inflammatory cardiovascular risk in patients already receiving optimal medical therapy, but prescribing novel anti-inflammatory treatments will be problematic due to the lack of specific companion diagnostic tests, to guide their targeted use in clinical practice. Currently available tests for the detection of coronary inflammation are either non-specific for the cardiovascular system (e.g. plasma biomarkers) or expensive and not readily available (e.g. hybrid positron emission tomography imaging). Recent technological advancements in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allow non-invasive detection of high-risk plaque features (positive remodelling, spotty calcification, low attenuation plaque, and napkin-ring sign) and help identify the vulnerable patient, but they provide only indirectly information about coronary inflammation. Perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI), a novel method for assessing coronary inflammation by analysing routine CCTA, captures changes in the perivascular adipose tissue composition driven by inflammatory signals coming from the inflamed coronary artery, by analysing the three-dimensional gradients of perivascular attenuation, followed by adjustments for technical, anatomical, and biological factors. By detecting vascular inflammation, perivascular FAI enhances cardiovascular risk discrimination which could aid more cost-effective deployment of novel therapeutic agents. In this article, we present the existing non-invasive modalities for the detection of coronary inflammation and provide a practical guide for their use in clinical practice.</p>

<p>The use of porous scaffolds created by additive manufacturing is considered a viable approach for the regeneration of critical-size bone defects. This paper investigates the xenotransplantation of polycaprolactone (PCL) tissue constructs seeded with differentiated and undifferentiated human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) to treat calvarial critical-sized defect in Wistar rats. PCL scaffolds without cells were also considered. In vitro and in vivo biological evaluations were performed to assess the feasibility of these different approaches. In the case of cell seeded scaffolds, it was possible to observe the presence of hADSCs in the rat tissue contributing directly (osteoblasts) and indirectly (stimulation by paracrine factors) to tissue formation, organization and mineralization. The presence of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in the rat tissue treated with cell-seeded PCL scaffolds suggests that the paracrine factors of undifferentiated hADSC cells could stimulate BMP-2 production by surrounding cells, leading to osteogenesis. Moreover, BMP-2 acts synergistically with growth factors to induce angiogenesis, leading to higher numbers of blood vessels in the groups containing undifferentiated and differentiated hADSCs.</p>

<p>AIMS: We evaluated the relationship between epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and coronary vascular function assessed by rubidium-82 (82Rb) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included 270 patients with suspected CAD and normal myocardial perfusion at stress-rest 82Rb PET/CT. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and EAT volume were measured. Absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) was computed in mL/min/ from the dynamic rest and stress imaging. Myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was defined as the ratio of hyperaemic to baseline MBF and it was considered reduced when &lt;2. MPR was normal in 177 (65%) patients and reduced in 93 (35%). Patients with impaired MPR were older (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and had higher CAC score values (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.033), EAT thickness (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009), and EAT volume (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). At univariable logistic regression analysis, age, heart rate reserve (HRR), CAC score, EAT thickness, and EAT volume resulted significant predictors of reduced MPR, but only age (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002), HRR (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021), and EAT volume (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.043) were independently associated with reduced MPR, at multivariable analysis. In patients with CAC score 0 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>114), a significant relation between EAT volume and MPR (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.014) was observed, while the relationship was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.21) in patients with CAC score &gt;0 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>156).CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected CAD and normal myocardial perfusion, EAT volume predicts hyperaemic MBF and reduced MPR, confirming that visceral pericardium fat may influence coronary vascular function. Thus, EAT evaluation has a potential role in the early identification of coronary vascular dysfunction.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Mineralocorticoid receptor activation of the epithelial sodium channel in endothelial cells (ECs) (EnNaC) is accompanied by aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated arterial relaxation. Recent data support enhanced activity of the alpha subunit of EnNaC (aEnNaC) mediates this aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and associated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation. There is mounting evidence that diet induced obesity diminishes expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase a (AMPKa), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which would be expected to lead to impaired downstream eNOS activation. Thereby, we posited that enhanced EnNaC activation contributes to diet induced obesity related increases in stiffness of the endothelium and diminished NO mediated vascular relaxation by increasing oxidative stress and related inhibition of AMPKa, Sirt1, and associated eNOS inactivation.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that endothelial specific EnNaC activation mediates WD-induced endothelial stiffness, impaired eNOS activation, aortic fibrosis and remodeling through increased aortic oxidative stress and increased inflammation related to a reduction of AMPKa and Sirt 1 mediated eNOS phosphorylation/activation and NO production.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: South Asians have a high risk to develop type 2 diabetes, which may be related to substantial ectopic fat deposition. Since glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues can reduce ectopic fat accumulation, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of treatment with liraglutide for 26 weeks on ectopic fat deposition and HbA1c in South Asian patients with type 2 diabetes.METHODS: In a placebo-controlled trial, 47 South Asian patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to treatment with liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) or placebo added to standard care. At baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment we assessed abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, epicardial and paracardial adipose tissue volume using MRI. Furthermore, myocardial and hepatic triglyceride content were examined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.CONCLUSIONS: While the intention-to-treat analysis did not show effects of liraglutide on ectopic fat and HbA1c, per-protocol analysis showed that liraglutide decreases visceral adipose tissue volume, which was associated with improved glycaemic control in South Asians.

<p>BACKGROUD: Among various myocyte-derived bioactive molecules (myokines), ß-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) is a unique myokine that attenuates skeletal muscle insulin resistance and inflammation, increases browning of white adipose tissue, and enhances hepatic fatty acid oxidation, resulting in upregulated energy expenditure of the whole body. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BAIBA on the vascular endothelial cell function.METHODS: The mRNA levels of proinflammatory molecules, antioxidants, and their related transcription regulators were examined by quantitative RT-PCR in BAIBA-treated human aortic or umbilical vein endothelial cells (HAEC or HUVEC, respectively), with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a stimulation. The protein expression and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were determined by Western blot analysis.RESULTS: BAIBA pretreatment significantly suppressed the mRNA levels of the adhesion molecules in the TNF-a-stimulated HAEC and HUVEC. BAIBA treatment significantly increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant molecules, catalase, superoxide dismutases, thioredoxin, and gamma-glutamylcysteine ligases, together with mitochondrial biogenesis-related molecules, nuclear respiratory factor 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A. In addition, BAIBA treatment significantly increased the transcription factors that regulated these genes [i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-d, PPAR-<U+03B3>, estrogen-related receptor a (ERRa), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1ß]. Adenovirus-mediated PGC-1ß overexpression significantly increased the mRNA levels of all antioxidant molecules. The phosphorylation levels of AMPK and eNOS were unaltered by BAIBA.CONCLUSIONS: In vascular endothelial cells, BAIBA had antiatherogenic effects through the PGC-1ß-ERRa/PPAR-d and PPAR-<U+03B3> pathway. This can explain the beneficial effects of exercise on vascular endothelial function.</p>

<p>In breast tumors, it is well established that intratumoral angiogenesis is crucial for malignant progression, but little is known about the vascular characteristics of extratumoral, cancer-adjacent breast. Genome-wide transcriptional data suggest that extratumoral microenvironments may influence breast cancer phenotypes; thus, histologic features of cancer-adjacent tissue may also have clinical implications. To this end, we developed a digital algorithm to quantitate vascular density in approximately 300 histologically benign tissue specimens from breast cancer patients enrolled in the UNC Normal Breast Study (NBS). Specimens were stained for CD31, and vascular content was compared to demographic variables, tissue composition metrics, and tumor molecular features. We observed that the vascular density of cancer-adjacent breast was significantly higher in older and obese women, and was strongly associated with breast adipose tissue content. Consistent with observations that older and heavier women experience higher frequencies of ER<sup>+</sup> disease, higher extratumoral vessel density was also significantly associated with positive prognostic tumor features such as lower stage, negative nodal status, and smaller size (&lt;2cm). These results reveal biological relationships between extratumoral vascular content and body size, breast tissue composition, and tumor characteristics, and suggest biological plausibility for the relationship between weight gain (and corresponding breast tissue changes) and breast cancer progression.</p>

<p>Obesity is a common metabolic disorder that has become a widespread epidemic in several countries. Sex and gender disparities in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been well-documented with premenopausal women having a lower incidence of CVD than age-matched men. However, women are more likely than men to suffer from obesity, which can predispose them to greater CVD risk. The mechanisms underlying high-fat diet (HFD)- or obesity-induced hypertension are not well defined, although immune system activation and inflammation have been implicated in several studies. Further, the sex of the subject can have a profound influence on the immune response to hypertensive stimuli. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to examine the impact of sex and gender on the role of the immune system in HFD-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction.</p>

<p>Regenerated organs are expected to solve the problem of donor-organ shortage in transplantation medicine. One approach to lung regeneration is to decellularize the organ and reseed it with selected cells. Advantage of the procedure includes reduced immunogenicity, since all cells can be theoretically replaced by autologous cells. However, little is known regarding the extracellular matrix (ECM) damage during decellularization and ECM reconstruction process in the organ regeneration. We aimed to evaluate ECM damage and reconstruction of the decellularized- recellularized rat lung, including the removal of alpha-gal xenoantigens. Rat lungs were perfused with sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100 via the pulmonary artery, after which the decellularized scaffold was reseeded with rat or human endothelial cells and adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). The ECM and alpha-gal antigen were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and a glycosaminoglycan assay. Alcian blue staining revealed increased production of proteoglycan following the addition of ASCs to the rat lung recellularized with rat lung microvascular endothelial cells. Glycosaminoglycan levels decreased in the decellularized lung and increased in the recellularized lung, especially in the ASC-treated group. Immunohistochemical expression of the alpha-gal protein was decreased to undetectable level in the decellularized lung tissue, and disappeared after recellularization with human cells. In western blot analysis, the bands of alpha-gal protein almost disappeared after recellularization with human cells. In conclusion, characteristics of the regenerated ECM might depend on the species and type of cells used for recellularization. Therefore, alpha-gal antigen might be eliminated after a prolonged culture, when using human cells.</p>

<p>Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) causes various metabolic derangements. These include obesity and insulin resistance since inhibiting glucose utilization in adipose tissues is a major function of GC. Although adipose tissue distribution and glucose homeostasis are sex-dependently regulated, it has not been evaluated whether GC affects glucose metabolism and adipose tissue functions in a sex-dependent manner. In this study, high-dose corticosterone (rodent GC) treatment in C57BL/6J mice resulted in non-fasting hyperglycemia in male mice only while both sexes displayed hyperinsulinemia with normal fasting glucose levels, indicative for insulin resistance. Metabolic testing using stable isotope-labeled glucose techniques revealed a sex-specific corticosterone-driven glucose intolerance. Corticosterone treatment increased adipose tissue mass in both sexes, which was reflected by elevated serum leptin levels. However, female mice showed more metabolically protective adaptations of adipose tissues than male mice, demonstrated by higher serum total and high molecular weight adiponectin levels, more hyperplastic morphological changes, and a stronger increase in mRNA expression of adipogenic differentiation markers. Subsequently, in vitro studies in 3T3-L1 (white) and T37i (brown) adipocytes suggest that the increased leptin and adiponectin levels were mainly driven by the elevated insulin levels. In summary, this study demonstrates that GC-induced insulin resistance is more severe in male than in female mice, which can be partially explained by a sex-dependent adaptation of adipose tissues.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: A progressive decline in lean body mass and increase in fat mass occur with aging, and result in progressive weakness and impaired mobility; these features are altogether landmarks of the ageing frailty syndrome. High-fat mass and low muscle mass are both associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and are supposed to be risk factors for arterial stiffness. Little data analyzing the relationship between body composition and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) are currently available. The main objective of this study was to verify whether low muscle mass and/or high fat mass could be associated with arterial stiffness measured by CAVI.METHODS: Data are from the cross-sectional assessment of the “Al passo con la tua salute”, a clinical study aimed to promote physical function among free-living elderly subjects.After a screening interview and a clinical visit aimed to exclude ineligible persons, 52 volunteers were enrolled in the study. All underwent: clinical examination, physical performance assessment, an interview on lifestyle and dietary habits, and lastly, a blood sample collection after at least 8 hours of fasting.RESULTS: CAVI was statistically significantly higher in those participants in the highest tertile of distribution for fat mass compared to all other subjects (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.03). In those participants in the lowest tertile of distribution of muscle mass, compared to all other, CAVI was also statistically significant higher (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.01) independently of age, sex, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.CONCLUSIONS: Low muscle mass and high fat mass were landmarks in the frailty model of aging; therefore, it is not inconsistent that both clinical conditions might share with the “aging vessel” a common pathway, probably mediated through signaling network deregulation and/or through alteration of the balance between energy availability and energy demand.</p>

<p>In the field of wound healing, stem cell-based strategies are gaining importance for their regenerative potential. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a particular subset of mesenchymal stem cells present in the stromal-vascular fraction of the adipose tissue, today considered very attractive for their relative abundance and accessibility in the human body. However, ADSCs are still not routinely used in normal clinical practice. Several studies have also reported ADSC transplantation in association with biomaterials in an attempt to enhance the local retention and growth rate of the cells. The aim of our study was to evaluate the ability of ADSCs to build a dermal scaffold to be potentially used as a dermal substitute in the field of wound healing, with optimal biocompatibility and mechanical properties. ADSCs were defined as CD90-, CD73-, and CD105-positive cells. ADSCs turned out to be capable of secreting all the main components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) upon stimulation, thus efficiently producing a collagen and fibronectin-containing dermal matrix. We also checked whether the ADSC-produced dermal scaffold could be seeded with keratinocytes. The scaffolding material directly produced by ADSCs has several advantages when compared to the commercially available ones: it is easily obtained from the patients and it is 100% biocompatible and supports cell-ECM interaction. Moreover, it represents a possible powerful therapeutic tool for patients with chronic ulcers since it appears to be potentially grafted with keratinocytes layers, thus bypassing the classical two-step grafting procedure.</p>

<p>The attachments of jaw muscles are typically implicated in the evolution and shape of the dorsotemporal fenestra on the skull roof of amniotes. However, the dorsotemporal fenestrae of many archosaurian reptiles possess smooth excavations rostral and dorsal to the dorsotemporal fossa which closely neighbors the dorsotemporal fenestra and jaw muscle attachments. Previous research has typically identified this region, here termed the frontoparietal fossa, to also have attachment surfaces for jaw-closing muscles. However, numerous observations of extant and extinct archosaurs described here suggest that other tissues are instead responsible for the size and shape of the frontoparietal fossa. This study reviewed the anatomical evidence that support soft-tissue hypotheses of the frontoparietal fossa and its phylogenetic distribution among sauropsids. Soft-tissue hypotheses (i.e., muscle, pneumatic sinus, vascular tissues) were analyzed using anatomical, imaging and in vivo thermography techniques within a phylogenetic framework using extant and extinct taxa to determine the inferential power underlying the reconstruction of the soft tissues in the skull roofs of dinosaurs, pseudosuchians, and other reptiles. Relevant anatomical features argue for rejection of the default hypothesis-that the fossa was muscular-due to a complete lack of osteological correlates reflective of muscle attachment. The most-supported inference of soft tissues is that the frontoparietal fossa contained a large vascular structure and adipose tissue. Despite the large sizes and diverse morphologies of these fossae found among dinosaur taxa, these data suggest that non-avian dinosaurs had the anatomical foundation to support physiologically significant vascular devices and/or vascular integumentary structures on their skull roofs.

<p>We examined the effects of VEGFA on damage and regeneration in steatotic and non-steatotic livers of rats submitted to PH under I/R, and characterized the underlying mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that VEGFA levels were decreased in both steatotic and non-steatotic livers after surgery. The administration of VEGFA increased VEGFA levels in non-steatotic livers, reducing the incidence of post-operative complications following surgery through the VEGFR2-Wnt2 pathway, independently of Id1. Unexpectedly, administration of VEGFA notably reduced VEGFA levels in steatotic livers, exacerbating damage and regenerative failure. After exogenous administration of VEGFA in steatotic animals, circulating VEGFA is sequestered by the high circulating levels of sFlt1 released from adipose tissue. Under such conditions, VEGFA cannot reach the steatotic liver to exert its effects. Consequently, the concomitant administration of VEGFA and an antibody against sFlt1 was required to avoid binding of sFlt1 to VEGFA. This was associated with high VEGFA levels in steatotic livers and protection against damage and regenerative failure, plus improvement in the survival rate via up-regulation of PI3K/Akt independently of the Id1-Wnt2 pathway. The current study highlights the different effects and signaling pathways of VEGFA in liver surgery requiring PH and I/R based in the presence of steatosis. KEY MESSAGES: VEGFA administration improves PH+I/R injury only in non-steatotic livers of Ln animals. VEGFA benefits are exerted through the VEGFR2-Wnt2 pathway in non-steatotic livers. In Ob rats, exogenous VEGFA is sequestered by circulating sFlt1, exacerbating liver damage. Therapeutic combination of VEGFA and anti-sFlt1 is required to protect steatotic livers. VEGFA+anti-sFlt1 treatment protects steatotic livers through a VEGFR2-PI3K/Akt pathway.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial biogenesis is a key feature of energy expenditure and organismal energy balance. Genetic deletion of PARP1 or PARP2 was shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and energy expenditure. In line with that, PARP inhibitors were shown to induce energy expenditure in skeletal muscle. We aimed to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of PARPs induces brown or beige adipocyte differentiation. SVF fraction of human pericardial adipose tissue was isolated and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) were differentiated to white and beige adipocytes. A subset of hADMSCs were differentiated to white adipocytes in the presence of Olaparib, a potent PARP inhibitor currently in clinical use, to induce browning. Olaparib induced morphological changes (smaller lipid droplets) in white adipocytes that is a feature of brown/beige adipocytes. Furthermore, Olaparib induced mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes and enhanced UCP1 expression. We showed that Olaparib treatment inhibited nuclear and cytosolic PAR formation, induced NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio and consequently boosted SIRT1 and AMPK activity and the downstream transcriptional program leading to increases in OXPHOS. Olaparib treatment did not induce the expression of beige adipocyte markers in white adipocytes, suggesting the formation of brown or brown-like adipocytes. PARP1, PARP2 and tankyrases are key players in the formation of white adipose tissue. Hereby, we show that PARP inhibition induces the transdifferentiation of white adipocytes to brown-like adipocytes suggesting that PARP activity could be a determinant of the differentiation of these adipocyte lineages.</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANCE: Highly prevalent in Western cultures, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and cost health care systems billions of dollars annually. At the cellular level, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes are associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increased levels of ROS production in key organ systems like adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the vasculature causes disruption of tissue homeostasis leading to increased morbidity and risk of mortality. More specifically, growing evidence implicates the NADPH oxidase (Nox) enzymes in these pathologies through impairment of insulin signaling, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction. The Nox family of enzymes is a major driver of redox signaling through its production of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and downstream oxidative metabolites.CRITICAL ISSUES: However, due to the short half-lives of individual ROS and/or cellular defense systems, radii of ROS diffusion are commonly short, restricting redox signaling and oxidant stress to often localized events. Thus, special emphasis should be placed on cell type and subcellular location of Nox enzymes to better understand their role in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases. Recent Advances: The primary goal of this review is to highlight recent advances and survey our current understanding of cell specific Nox enzymes’ contributions to metabolic diseases.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: We discuss the targeting of Nox enzymes as potential therapy and bring to light potential emerging areas Nox research, microparticles and epigenetics, in the context of metabolic disease.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue stem cells (ASCs), known as multipotent stem cells, are most commonly used in the clinical applications in recent years. Adipose tissues (AT) have the advantage in the harvesting, isolation, and expansion of ASCs, especially an abundant amount of stem cells compared to bone marrow. ASCs can be found in stromal vascular fractions (SVF) which are easily obtained from the dissociation of adipose tissue. Both SVFs and culture-expanded ASCs exhibit the stem cell characteristics such as differentiation into multiple cell types, regeneration, and immune regulators. Therefore, SVFs and ASCs have been researched to evaluate the safety and benefits for human use. In fact, the number of clinical trials on ASCs is going to increase by years; however, most trials are in phase I and II, and lack phase III and IV. This systemic review highlights and updates the process of the harvesting, characteristics, isolation, culture, storage, and application of ASCs, as well as provides further directions on the therapeutic use of ASCs.</p>

These components include micro-fragmented fat (nanofat), the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC), and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have all shown capability to repair, regenerate, and rejuvenate surrounding tissue. Various aesthetic applications including hair growth, scar reduction, skin ischemia-reperfusion recovery, and facial rejuvenation are reviewed.

<p>Our understanding of the regulation of vascular function, specifically that of vasomotion, has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. The classic conception of a vascular system solely regulated by circulating hormones and sympathetic innervation gave way to a vision of a local regulation. Initially by the so-called, autacoids like prostacyclin, which represented the first endothelium-derived paracrine regulator of smooth muscle. This was the prelude of the EDRF-nitric oxide age that has occupied vascular scientists for nearly 30 years. Endothelial cells revealed to have the ability to generate numerous mediators besides prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). The need to classify these substances led to the coining of the terms: endothelium-derived relaxing, hyperpolarizing and contracting factors, which included various prostaglandins, thromboxane A2, endothelin, as well numerous candidates for the hyperpolarizing factor. The opposite layer of the vascular wall, the adventitia, eventually and for a quite short period of time, enjoyed the attention of some vascular physiologists. Adventitial fibroblasts were recognized as paracrine cells to the smooth muscle because of their ability to produce some substances such as superoxide. Remarkably, this took place before our awareness of the functional potential of another adventitial cell, the adipocyte. Possibly, because the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) was systematically removed during the experiments as considered a non-vascular artifact tissue, it took quite long to be considered a major source of paracrine substances. These are now being integrated in the vast pool of mediators synthesized by adipocytes, known as adipokines. They include hormones involved in metabolic regulation, like leptin or adiponectin; classic vascular mediators like NO, angiotensin II or catecholamines; and inflammatory mediators or adipocytokines. The first substance studied was an anti-contractile factor named adipose-derived relaxing factor of uncertain chemical nature but possibly, some of the relaxing mediators mentioned above are behind this factor. This manuscript intends to review the vascular regulation from the point of view of the paracrine control exerted by the cells present in the vascular environment, namely, endothelial, adventitial, adipocyte and vascular stromal cells.</p>

<p>Tissue engineering technology provides an alternative for bladder reconstruction, which remains confronted with challenges, such as insufficient vascularization in regenerated bladder tissue. Short-term hypoxic preconditioning has been reported to be an effective method to enhance the angiogenic effect of stem cells. This study evaluated the effect and mechanism of hypoxia-preconditioned adipose tissue-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hp-ADEPCs) on the vascularization and smooth muscle regeneration of tissue engineered bladders. Rats were randomly divided into the following four groups: hp-ADEPC, ADEPC, bladder acellular matrix (BAM), and cystotomy groups. A partial cystectomy was performed to remove 50% of the bladder, which was augmented with hp-ADEPC-BAM, ADEPC-BAM, or BAM. Histological and functional assessments of the engineered neobladder were performed at 1 and 3 months after surgery, while the mechanism of hp-ADEPCs on vascularization was also investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hp-ADEPC-BAM significantly promoted urothelium, blood vessel, smooth muscle and nerve cell regeneration. Animals in the hp-ADEPC-BAM group exhibited higher bladder compliance and a relatively normal micturition pattern compared to the ADEPC-BAM and BAM groups. In addition, compared to ADEPCs, hp-ADEPCs promoted ERK phosphorylation activation and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a expression, thereby secreting more vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor and significantly enhancing the migration and angiogenesis abilities of rat endothelial cells. This is the first study to demonstrate that a combination of ADEPCs and BAM with short-term hypoxic preconditioning enhances angiogenesis and promotes the functional recovery of tissue engineered bladders.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old male presented with a gradually growing mass in the left lateral brow region for 2 years. On imaging, the mass appeared to arise from the lacrimal gland, was cystic, without any bony abnormality. With a diagnosis of dermoid cyst, an excision biopsy was performed. The histopathology revealed an epithelium-lined cyst, with the wall of the cyst comprising dermal adnexa and inflammatory cells. The wall also contained fragments of skeletal muscle, nerve bundles, adipose tissue, exocrine and secretory acini, few blood vessels with occasional hair shafts, with the lacrimal gland in the periphery of the tumor. There were no immature elements, atypia, and malignant cells, thus confirming the diagnosis of a mature cystic teratoma. Primary lacrimal gland teratoma is a rare diagnosis and its presentation in adults is extremely uncommon.</p>

<p>Bile acids play a major role in the regulation of lipid and energy metabolism. Here we propose the hepatic bile acid uptake transporter Na+ taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) as a target to prolong postprandial bile acid elevations in plasma. Reducing hepatic clearance of bile acids from plasma by genetic deletion of NTCP moderately increased plasma bile acid levels, reduced diet-induced obesity, attenuated hepatic steatosis, and lowered plasma cholesterol levels. NTCP-G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5) double knockout mice were equally protected against diet-induced-obesity as NTCP single knockout mice. NTCP knockout mice displayed decreased intestinal fat absorption and a trend towards higher fecal energy output. Furthermore, NTCP deficiency was associated with an increased uncoupled respiration in brown adipose tissue, leading to increased energy expenditure. We conclude that targeting NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake can be a novel approach to treat obesity and obesity-related hepatosteatosis by simultaneously dampening intestinal fat absorption and increasing energy expenditure.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and metabolic disorders is complex and highly associated. The impairment of adipogenic capacity in pre-adipocytes may promote adipocyte hypertrophy and increase the risk of further metabolic dysfunction. We hypothesize that intermittent hypoxia (IH), as a pathophysiologic feature of OSA, may regulate adipogenesis by promoting macrophage polarization.METHODS: Male C57BL/6N mice were exposed to either IH (240 seconds of 10% O2 followed by 120 seconds of 21% O2, i.e., 10 cycles/hour) or intermittent normoxia (IN) for 6 weeks. Stromal-vascular fractions derived from subcutaneous (SUB-SVF) and visceral (VIS-SVF) adipose tissues were cultured and differentiated. Conditioned media from cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages after air (Raw) or IH exposure (Raw-IH) were incubated with SUB-SVF during adipogenic differentiation.CONCLUSION: Low frequency IH exposure impaired adipogenesis of SAT in lean mice, and macrophage polarization may be a potential mechanism for the impaired adipogenesis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) could affect PVAT characters, and whether the SGLT2 inhibitors-induced changes of adipose tissue, especially the alternation of adipose tissue-derived secretory factors, affect vascular pathophysiology.METHODS: Western-type diet (WD) fed wild-type mice were treated with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) for 10 weeks. WEHI 274.1 and primary vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated with conditioned media (CM) of epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) or abdominal PVAT of Ipra- or vehicle-treated mice fed a WD. Epi of Ipra- or vehicle-treated mice fed a WD was implanted onto cuff-placed femoral arteries of apoE-deficient mice.RESULTS: Ipra increased adipocyte size associated with decreased expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrosis-related genes in abdominal PVAT of WD-fed mice. Ipra also suppressed WD-induced macrophages accumulation, fibrosis, and adipocyte death in abdominal PVAT. In CM of abdominal PVAT from Ipra-treated mice, concentration of leptin was significantly lower than that from vehicle-treated mice. In vitro, migration of WEHI 274.1 and primary vascular smooth muscle cells were more enhanced by CM of Epi or abdominal PVAT from vehicle-treated mice than that from Ipra-treated mice. Perivascular implantation of Epi from Ipra-treated mice to apolipoprotein E-deficient mice attenuated cuff-induced neointimal hyperplasia and vascular remodeling compared to that from vehicle-treated mice.CONCLUSIONS: The Ipra-induced changes of abdominal PVAT will lead to a better understanding of unveiled mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors prevent cardiovascular complications in T2DM, and the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting PVAT.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) is increasingly prescribed to patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Adipose tissue (AT) inflammation during obesity plays a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance, type II diabetes and atherogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of thrombin inhibition by dabigatran in a combined model of diet-induced obesity and atherosclerosis.RESULTS: Dabigatran-treated animals showed increased adipocyte hypertrophy, but reduced numbers of pro-inflammatory M1-polarized macrophages in the adipose tissue. Abundance of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages was also decreased in the aortic wall of dabigatran-fed mice. Multiple circulating cytokines were reduced, indicating an effect in systemically relevant secretory compartments such as the AT.CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran treatment reduces pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions, thereby contributing to plaque stabilizing and atheroprotective effects of the thrombin inhibitor. This finding is not restricted to the vascular wall but is also present in AT where dabigatran treatment reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and accumulation of M1 macrophages.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) play an important role in regenerative medicine and in the treatment of osteoarthritis. ASCs extracted from lipoaspirates are a valuable cell source due to their abundance and accessibility. ASCs are retrieved from the aqueous fraction of the digested lipoaspirate. The aqueous fraction is known as SVF and includes, ASCs, endothelial precursor cells (EPCs), endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes, pericytes, as well as pre-adipocytes. To date, two types of techniques to isolate SVF have been proposed: enzymatic and mechanical. The enzymatic method is particularly indicated in SVF isolation since it disrupts the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the binding of adipocytes and other cells but is restricted by regulatory issues related to enzymatic procedures, especially within the European Community. Thus, making the search for alternative mechanical methods imperative. This study assesses the SVF harvested from subcutaneous abdominal fat via two different mechanical procedures and the standard enzymatic method to evaluate their eligibility in a clinical context. In particular, we analyze cell viability (at 0 and after 72 h) as well as the expression of cluster differentiation (CD) for each sample and the differentiation in adipocytic, chondrocytic, osteocytic linage. The mechanical procedures yielded no significant difference in cell viability and cluster differentiation pattern expression, even if enzymatic procedure still remain the “gold standard.” We retain that clinical efficacy in treating ostheoarthrosis with SVF administration is probably related to his anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effect, rather than the ability to differentiate in specific cell lineage. However, further studies are required to support and improve our findings.</p>

<p>Over the past decades, there has been a major increase in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence in most regions of the world. Diabetic patients are more prone to cardiovascular complications. Accumulating evidence suggests that adipose tissue is not simply an energy storage tissue but it also functions as a secretory tissue producing a variety of bioactive substances, also referred to as adipokines. The balance between pro-inflammatory adipokines and protective adipokines is disturbed in type 2 diabetes, this can be regarded as adipose tissue dysfunction which partly promote the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. In this review, we not only discuss the favorable adipokines like adiponectin, omentin, C1q tumor necrosis factor-related proteins, but also unfavorable ones like resisitin and visfatin, in the aim of finding potential biomarkers recommended for the clinical use in the diagnosis, prognosis and follow up of patients with T2D at high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well as leading to new therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: Vaginal atrophy is characterized by thinning of vaginal epithelial layers and decreased local blood flow. We aimed to evaluate the regenerative effects of Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) and Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMDSC) on vaginal atrophy in rat menopause model.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into 4 (four) groups: sham, control, ADMSC, BMDSC. Vaginal epithelial thickness, structure of the lamina propria, blood vessels in the lamina propria, collagen deposition, and muscle structure were evaluated. Anti ER a, VEGF, VEGFR 1, Bax and bcl-2 antibodies were analyzed. Beta actin gene was used as endogenous control. Genetical differences among the groups were compared by using Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U test. p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.RESULTS: Epithelial thickness of ADMSC group was higher than control group, but less than sham group Epithelial thickness of BMDSC group was less than sham group. Lamina propria and muscle tissue of ADMSC and BMDSC groups were found to be similar to sham group. VEGFR-1, VEGF, Bax and ER-a staining levels were higher in ADMSC and BMDSC groups than control group. ADMSC group stained stronger with VEGFR-1 and VEGF than BMDSC group. Bcl-2 staining level was increased in ADMSC applied group. No statistically significant difference was detected in Bax and Bcl-2 genes and Bax-/Bcl-2 ratio.CONCLUSIONS: Although genetic expression might have ended and could not be significantly demonstrated, histological and immunohistochemical results favor ADMSC application in vaginal atrophy rather than BMDSC.</p>

<p>The obese brain is stressed and inflamed. This is mainly at the level of neurons and glial cells in the hypothalamus: a brain region where the adipokine leptin acts to control feeding and body weight. Relieving hypothalamic neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with the natural small molecule drugs celastrol or withaferin-A reverses the leptin resistance commensurate with obesity, producing a degree of weight loss found only with bariatric surgery. Here, recent evidence from rodent models of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is brought to the fore which suggests that this particular bariatric surgical procedure may work in a similar fashion to celastrol and withaferin-A alongside remedying hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis. Thus, restoring and preserving healthy hypothalamic neuronal and glial cell function, be it by pharmacological or surgical means, ensures a negative energy balance in an environment constructed to promote a one - possibly through re-establishing communication between adipose tissue and the brain.</p>

<p>Modulation of expression of adipose tissue-specific transcripts has been known to regulate adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Recently, adipose-specific expression patterns and developmental regulation of the gene-encoding retinol-binding protein 7 (RBP7) was identified. However, its expression in adipose tissue of the porcine species has yet to be explored. In this study, adipose tissue-specific expression of porcine RBP7 was identified and conservation of the fatty acid-binding domains and evolutionary relationship of the RBP7 gene were verified comparatively across mammalian species. Our in vitro and in vivo analysis of gene expression revealed that RBP7 expression was significantly high in fat cell fraction compared to stromal vascular cells (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) and increased during development (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). The level of RBP7 expression was upregulated during a 24-h short-term fasting intervention and restored 6 h after refeeding (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Taken together, these studies provide insights into the role of RBP7 in adipose tissue of pigs during development and nutritional intervention and pave the way for future studies on the regulation of retinol homeostasis in porcine adipose tissue.</p>

<p>CONTEXT: Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4) is expressed in adipose tissue and may impair glucose homeostasis and promote atherosclerotic processes.OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between serum FABP4 and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.DESIGN: Case-cohort study embedded within a sample of 27,548 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort.PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A randomly drawn subcohort (n=2194) of participants who were free of cardiovascular disease and T2D at study baseline and 728 incident T2D cases, 206 incident stroke cases, and 185 incident MI cases with an average 8.2 (±1.7) years of follow up.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident T2D, MI and stroke.RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted model taking into account age, sex, education and lifestyle factors, body mass index and waist circumference, the hazard ratios (HRs) in the highest versus lowest quartile of FABP4 were 1.81 (95% CI, 1.21-2.70; P for trend = 0.01) for T2D, 0.93 (95%CI, 0.55-1.55; P for trend =0.68) for MI and 1.41 (95% CI, 0.80-2.49; P for trend = 0.24) for stroke, respectively. Adjustment for HbA1c further attenuated the association for T2D. In analyses stratified by sex, no statistically significant differences could be seen for associations between FABP4 and T2D and MI (P-interaction by sex = 0.27 and 0.84, respectively), whereas a higher risk of stroke was observed in men (HR: 2.70, 95% CI 1.20-6.00; P-value =0.04), but not in women (HR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.31-1.60; P-value = 0.53; P for interaction = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: These data give support to the hypothesis that elevated FABP4 levels may contribute to T2D risk. In contrast, our data did not support the hypothesis that circulating FABP4 may be relevant for myocardial infarction, whereas the observed association with stroke in men may need further evaluation.</p>

<p>CONTEXT: Diabetes causes severe pathological changes to the microvasculature in many organs and tissues, and is at the same time associated with an increased risk of coronary and peripheral macrovascular events. We herein review alterations in angiogenesis observed in human and experimental diabetes and how they contribute to diabetes onset and development of vascular complications.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The English language medical literature was searched for articles reporting on angio/vasculogenesis abnormalities in diabetes, their clinical manifestations, mechanistic aspects, and possible therapeutic implications.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Angiogenesis is a complex process, driven by a multiplicity of molecular mechanisms and involved in several physiological and pathological conditions. Incompetent angiogenesis is pervasive to diabetic vascular complications, with both excessive and defective angiogenesis observed in various tissues. A striking different angiogenic response typically occurs in the retina versus the myocardium and peripheral circulation, but some commonalities in abnormal angiogenesis can explain the well-known association between micro- and macroangiopathy. Impaired angiogenesis can also affect endocrine islet and adipose tissue function, providing a link to diabetes onset. Exposure to high glucose itself directly affects angio/vasculogenic processes and the mechanisms include defective responses to hypoxia and pro-angiogenic factors, impaired nitric oxide bioavailability, shortage of pro-angiogenic cells, and loss of pericytes.CONCLUSIONS: Dissecting the molecular drivers of tissue-specific alterations of angio-/vasculogenesis is an important challenge to devise new therapeutic approaches. Angiogenesis-modulating therapies should be carefully evaluated in view of their potential off-target effects. At present, glycemic control remains the most reasonable therapeutic strategy to normalize angiogenesis in diabetes.</p>

<p>Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) is an essential therapeutic tool in periodontal plastic surgery and implantology. The aim of this preliminary study was to observe and make a histological and histomorphometric comparison of the composition of subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTGs) harvested from the palatal mucosa by two different harvesting techniques: mucoperiosteal (lamina propria and complete submucosa including periosteum) and mucosal (lamina propria and a portion of the submucosa). The main hypothesis proposes that SCTG harvested with the mucosal technique contains a greater proportion of connective tissue proper (CTP) and a lower proportion of adipose tissue (AT) than the mucoperiosteal technique. Twenty healthy patients who required SCTG for different purposes were selected and assigned to one of the two following groups: group A (n=10; mucoperiosteal harvesting technique) and group B (n=10, mucosal harvesting technique). The histological sample was obtained by removing a 2 mm thick slice from the most distal portion of the graft. The proportions of adipose tissue (AT), connective tissue proper (CTP) and vascular tissue (VT) were evaluated. In group A, histomorphometric analysis showed that CTP accounted for 58.2% of the graft while AT accounted for 32.64%. In group B, the proportions of CTP and AT were 79.86% and 11.93%, respectively. The differences between groups were statistically significant for both tissues (p&lt; .05). In contrast, no statistically significant difference was observed in the proportion of VT. Within the limitations of this study, the results show that the SCTGs harvested by the mucosal technique contain a greater proportion of CTP and a lower proportion of AT than those obtained by the mucoperiosteal technique, whereas the proportion of VT does not differ. Further long-term clinical and histological studies with more samples are needed to evaluate the clinical implications of SCTG composition.El injerto de tejido conectivo subepitelial (ITCSE) es una herramienta indispensable en la cirugía plástica periodontal y la implantología. El objetivo del presente estudio preliminar fue observar y comparar histológica e histomorfometricamente la composición de los injertos de tejido conectivo subepitelial (ITCSE) obtenidos de la mucosa palatina mediante dos técnicas diferentes: mucoperióstica (lamina propia y submucosa incluyendo el periostio) y mucosa (lámina propia y parte de la submucosa). La principal hipótesis postula que el ITCSE obtenido mediante la técnica mucosa contiene mayor proporción de tejido conectivo propiamente dicho (TCP) y menor proporción de tejido adiposo (TA) que el obtenido mediante la técnica mucoperióstica. El presente estudio incluyó veinte pacientes sanos que requerían ITCSE por diferentes motivos, los cuales fueron distribuidos de forma equitativa en dos grupos: grupo A (n=10; técnica de obtención mucoperióstica) y grupo B (n=10; técnica de obtención mucosa). La muestra histológica se obtuvo removiendo una porción de 2 mm de ancho de la parte más distal del injerto. Se evaluó la proporción (%) de tejido adiposo (TA), tejido conectivo propiamente dicho (TCP) y tejido vascular (TV). En el grupo A, el análisis histomorfométrico mostró que el TCP constituía el 58.2% del tejido mientras que el tejido adiposo constituía el 32.64%. En el grupo B, la proporción de TCP y AT fue 79.86%y 11.93%, respectivamente. Las diferencias observadas entre los grupos fueron estadísticamente significativas para ambos tejidos (p&lt; .05). En cambio, no se observaron diferencias estadísticamente significativas en la proporción de TV. Dentro de las limitaciones del presente estudio, los resultados mostraron que los ITCSE obtenidos mediante la técnica mucosa contienen mayor proporción de TCP y menor proporción de TA que los obtenidos con la técnica mucoperióstica, mientras que el TV permanece estable. Se requieren estudios longitudinales clínicos e histológicos a largo plazo con mayor cantidad de muestras para evaluar las implicancias clínicas de la composición del ITCSE.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A Body Shape Index (ABSI) and Body Roundness Index (BRI) are two new anthropometric adiposity indices that have shown to be associated better than BMI with adipose abdominal tissue, with the onset of diabetes and the risk of premature death. Little is known about the influence of ABSI and BRI on subclinical vascular damage. The study was aimed to assess the relationship between ABSI and BRI with carotid atherosclerosis damage in subjects with arterial hypertension.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 468 patients with arterial hypertension (30-80 years old) were enrolled; adiposity indices were calculated (BMI, WC, ABSI, BRI) and carotid ultrasonographic examination was performed to detect atherosclerotic damage (IMT or atherosclerotic plaque). BRI, but not ABSI, was higher in subjects with IMT&gt; 0.90 mm in comparison to those with a lower IMT (p &lt; 0.001), whereas patients with carotid plaques showed higher values of ABSI (p = 0.001), as well as of BRI (p = 0.003). Linear regression analysis disclosed significant correlation of IMT with ABSI, BRI and BMI (all p &lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, BRI was independently correlated with cIMT (p = 0.015). On the contrary, ABSI did not show any independent association with cIMT. However, ABSI was strongly associated with carotid plaques in multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for potential confounding factors. When BRI or BMI replaced ABSI into the multivariate models, they did not show any independent correlation with carotid plaques.CONCLUSIONS: ABSI may be proposed as a better correlate of carotid atherosclerosis than the traditional measures of adiposity.</p>

<p>Chronic, low-grade inflammation associated with obesity and diabetes result from the infiltration of adipose and vascular tissue by immune cells and contributes to cardiovascular complications. Despite an incomplete understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of immune cell differentiation and inflammation, O-GlcNAcylation, the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins by the two cycling enzymes, the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) and the O-GlcNAcase (OGA), may contribute to fine-tune immunity and inflammation in both physiological and pathological conditions. Early studies have indicated that O-GlcNAcylation of proteins play a pro-inflammatory role in diabetes and insulin resistance, whereas subsequent studies have demonstrated that this post-translational modification could also be protective against acute injuries. These studies suggest that diverse types of insults result in dynamic changes to O-GlcNAcylation patterns, which fluctuate with cellular metabolism to promote or inhibit inflammation. In this review, the current understanding of O-GlcNAcylation and its adaptive modulation in immune and inflammatory responses is summarized.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Our previous study proved that nanofat could enhance fat graft survival by promoting neovascularization. Fat extract (FE), a cell-free component derived from nanofat, also possesses proangiogenic activity.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether FE could improve fat graft survival and whether FE and nanofat could work synergistically to promote fat graft survival. The underlying mechanism was also investigated.METHODS: In the first animal study, human macrofat from lipoaspirate was co-transplanted into nude mice with FE or nanofat. The grafts were evaluated at 2, 4 and 12<U+2009>weeks post-transplantation. In the second animal study, nude mice were transplanted with a mixture of macrofat and nanofat, followed by intra-graft injection of FE at days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-transplantation. The grafts were evaluated at 12<U+2009>weeks post-transplantation. To detect the mechanism by which FE impacts graft survival, the proangiogenic, anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative activities of FE were analysed in grafts in vivo and in cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and fat tissue in vitro.RESULTS: In the first animal study, the weights of the fat grafts in the nanofat- and FE-treated groups were significantly higher than those of the fat grafts in the control group. In addition, higher fat integrity, more viable adipocytes, more CD31-positive blood vessels, fewer apoptotic cells and more Ki67-positive proliferating cells were observed in the nanofat- and FE-treated groups. In the second animal study, the weights of the fat grafts in the nanofat+FE group were significantly higher than those of the fat grafts in the control group. In vitro, FE showed proangiogenic effects on HUVECs, anti-apoptotic effects on fat tissue cultured under hypoxic conditions and an ability to promote ADSC proliferation and maintain their multiple differentiation capacity.CONCLUSIONS: FE could improve fat graft survival via proangiogenic, anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative effects on ADSCs. FE plus nanofat-assisted fat grafting is a new strategy that could potentially be used in clinical applications.</p>

<p>Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) are widely utilized, for example in manufacturing paints and in the cosmetic industry. In addition, there is raising interest in the application of NPs in stem cell research. However, cytotoxic, genotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects were shown for NPs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ZnO-NPs on cytokine secretion and differentiation properties of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs). Human ASCs were exposed to the subtoxic concentration of 0.2 µg/mL ZnO-NPs for 24 h. After four weeks of cultivation, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation procedures were performed. The multi-differentiation potential was confirmed histologically and using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, the gene expression of IL-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and caspase 3 was analyzed. Over the course of four weeks after ZnO-NPs exposure, no significant differences were detected in the gene expression of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF and caspase 3 compared to non-exposed cells. The differentiation was also not affected by the ZnO-NPs. These findings underline the fact, that functionality of ASCs is likely to be unaffected by ZnO-NPs, despite a long-term disposition of NPs in the cells, supposing that the starting concentration was safely in the non-toxic range. This might provide important information for single-use nanomedical applications of ZnO-NPs.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS: PAAT has distinctive anatomic features and developmental processes. Most PAAT adipocytes are originated from NCCs which derive from ectoderm. NCCs are progenitors not only of white adipocytes but also of brown adipocytes. This study indicates that the PAAT is derived from multiple cell lineages, the adipocytes derived from different origins have distinct transcriptional profiles, and PAAT plays a critical role in Ang II-induced common carotid artery inflammation and remodeling.Visual OvervieW: An online visual overview is available for this article.</p>

<p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic and chronic disorder, which is very common all over the world. Many genetic and nongenetic factors are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Meanwhile, the resistin gene is an important candidate in the pathogenesis of this complex condition. High levels of transcription of the resistin gene are associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, initiation and development of T2DM and atherosclerosis progression through induction of secretion of bioactive materials from adipocytes. Releasing adipose tissue-derived inflammatory cytokines is associated with inflammatory processes activation, which causes inhibition of insulin action via interference with insulin signaling, such that these disorders can contribute to insulin resistance. With the direct effect of resistin and other inflammatory mediators on vascular endothelial cells and arterial walls, the expression of cell adhesion molecules is increased. This process can lead to atherosclerosis and will result in coronary artery disease (CAD). In this review, we will explore the effects of resistin on inflammation and insulin resistance that may lead to type 2 diabetes and CAD.</p>

<p>Mutations in BSCL2 gene underlie human type 2 Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy (BSCL2) disease. Global Bscl2-/- mice recapitulate human BSCL2 lipodystrophy and develop insulin resistance and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The pathological mechanisms underlying the development of lipodystrophy and cardiomyopathy in BSCL2 are controversial. Here we report that Bscl2-/- mice develop cardiac hypertrophy due to increased basal IGF1 receptor (IGF1R)-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling. Bscl2-/- hearts exhibited increased adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) protein stability and expression causing drastic reduction of glycerolipids. Excessive fatty acid oxidation was overt in Bscl2-/- hearts, partially attributing to the hyperacetylation of cardiac mitochondrial proteins. Intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of ATGL could rescue adipocyte differentiation and lipodystrophy in Bscl2-/- cells and mice. Restoring a small portion of fat mass by ATGL partial deletion in Bscl2-/- mice not only reversed the systemic insulin resistance, but also ameliorated cardiac protein hyperacetylation, normalized cardiac substrate metabolism and improved contractile function. Collectively, our study uncovers novel pathways underlying lipodystrophy-induced cardiac hypertrophy and metabolic remodeling and pinpoints ATGL as a downstream target of BSCL2 in regulating the development of lipodystrophy and its associated cardiomyopathy.</p>

<p>AIM: The study aim was to analyze our own experience in treating patients with complex skull base defects accompanied by pneumocephalus and, based on the findings, to develop an optimal treatment approach for this pathology.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a series of 30 patients with complex skull base defects accompanied by pneumocephalus who underwent inpatient treatment at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in the period from 2001 to 2017. We analyzed demographic characteristics of patients (gender, age), clinical data (etiology, somatic and neuropsychiatric status, radiological data), and treatment aspects (conservative or surgical treatment, used approach, defect characteristics, reconstructive materials). Treatment outcomes were assessed based on analysis of changes in clinical manifestations, postoperative complications, and recurrences. The obtained data were compared to the results of literature review.RESULTS: In the series of 30 patients with complex skull base defects accompanied by pneumocephalus, the mean age was 41 years (range, 17-68 years); there were 17 (59%) males and 13 (41%) females. Etiologically, there were 17 (59%) traumatic cases, 11 (36%) iatrogenic cases, and 2 (5%) spontaneous cases. Clinically, the patients presented with the following manifestations: psycho-neurological symptoms (41%), nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (36%), impaired consciousness (27%), and meningitis (23%). Eight patients with acute injuries underwent complex conservative treatment that included infusion, and anti-edema, vascular, metabolic, anticonvulsant, and antibacterial therapy. In cases of conservative treatment failure or tension pneumocephalus accompanied by abrupt worsening of the patient’s condition, surgical treatment was used. A total of 24 interventions (including revision surgery) were performed in 22 patients. All patients underwent endoscopic endonasal reconstruction of complex skull base defects. Tissues used for reconstruction included the fascia lata and adipose tissue (77%), fascia lata and cartilage/bone from the nasal septum (14%), and a pedicled nasoseptal flap (9%). The success rate of reconstructive interventions was 91%. There were 2 (9%) recurrences. Postoperative complications in the form of meningitis occurred in 4 (18%) patients.CONCLUSION: In the case of a nasal cerebrospinal leak history and worsening of the patient’s condition accompanied by common cerebral and psychiatric symptoms, the development of pneumocephalus should be considered first, the early diagnosis of which will facilitate choosing the correct treatment approach. In the case of acute injury in patients with the established diagnosis of pneumocephalus caused by gas-forming infection, conservative therapy is indicated in the early period after neurosurgical interventions with opening of the meninges. Tension pneumocephalus together with a skull base bone defect (according to CT) and a nasal CSF leak history is the indication for surgical treatment. In this case, the endoscopic endonasal technique is the method of choice.</p>

<p>Obesity induces accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and ATM-driven inflammatory responses that promote the development of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. ClC-3 chloride channel/antiporter, encoded by the Clcn3, is critical for some basic cellular functions. Our previous work has shown significant alleviation of type 2 diabetes in Clcn3 knockout (Clcn3<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. In the present study we investigated the role of Clcn3 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and ATM inflammation. To establish the mouse obesity model, both Clcn3<sup>-/-</sup> mice and wild-type mice were fed a HFD for 4 or 16 weeks. The metabolic parameters were assessed and the abdominal total adipose tissue was scanned using computed tomography. Their epididymal fat pad tissue and adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were isolated for analyses. We found that the HFD-fed Clcn3<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed a significant decrease in obesity-induced body weight gain and abdominal visceral fat accumulation as well as an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism as compared with HFD-fed wild-type mice. Furthermore, the Clcn3 deficiency significantly attenuated HFD-induced ATM accumulation, HFD-increased F4/80<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>-</sup> SVF cells as well as HFD-activated TLR-4/NF-<U+03BA>B signaling in epididymal fat tissue. In cultured human THP-1 macrophages, adenovirus-mediated transfer of Clcn3 specific shRNA inhibited, whereas adenovirus-mediated cDNA overexpression of Clcn3 enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-<U+03BA>B and TLR-4. These results demonstrate a novel role for Clcn3 in HFD-induced obesity and ATM inflammation.</p>

<p>KEY POINTS: In vivo, uterine perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) potentiates uterine artery blood flow in pregnant rats, although not in non-pregnant rats. In isolated preparations, uterine PVAT has pro-contractile and anti-dilatory effects on uterine arteries. Pregnancy induces changes in uterine arteries that makes them responsive to uterine PVAT signalling.ABSTRACT: An increase in uterine artery blood flow (UtBF) is a common and necessary feature of a healthy pregnancy. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that adipose tissue surrounding uterine arteries (uterine perivascular adipose tissue; PVAT) is a novel local mediator of UtBF and uterine artery tone during pregnancy. In vivo experiments in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats showed that pregnant animals (gestational day 16, term = 22–23 days) had a three-fold higher UtBF compared to non-pregnant animals. Surgical removal of uterine PVAT reduced UtBF only in pregnant rats. In a series of ex vivo bioassays, we demonstrated that uterine PVAT had pro-contractile and anti-dilatory effects on rat uterine arteries. In the presence of PVAT-conditioned media, isolated uterine arteries from both pregnant and non-pregnant rats had reduced vasodilatory responses. In non-pregnant rats, these responses were mediated at the level of uterine vascular smooth muscle, whereas, in pregnant rats, PVAT-media reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Pregnancy increased adipocyte size in ovarian adipose tissue but had no effect on uterine PVAT adipocyte morphology. In addition, pregnancy down-regulated the gene expression of metabolic adipokines in uterine but not in aortic PVAT. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that uterine PVAT plays a regulatory role in UtBF, at least in part, as a result of its actions on uterine artery tone. We propose that the interaction between the uterine vascular wall and its adjacent adipose tissue may provide new insights for interventions in pregnancies with adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal UtBF.</p>

<p>Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are a recently discovered class of biologically active lipids. Here we identify the linoleic acid ester of 13-hydroxy linoleic acid (13-LAHLA) as an anti-inflammatory lipid. An oat oil fraction and FAHFA-enriched extract from this fraction showed anti-inflammatory activity in a lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine secretion assay. Structural studies identified three LAHLA isomers (15-, 13-, and 9-LAHLA) as being the most abundant FAHFAs in the oat oil fraction. Of these LAHLAs, 13-LAHLA is the most abundant LAHLA isomer in human serum after ingestion of liposomes made of fractionated oat oil, and it is also the most abundant endogenous LAHLA in mouse and human adipose tissue. As a result, we chemically synthesized 13-LAHLA for biological assays. 13-LAHLA suppresses lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of cytokines and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies identify LAHLAs as an evolutionarily conserved lipid with anti-inflammatory activity in mammalian cells.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are a promising candidates for cellular therapy in the field of regenerative medicine. ASCs are multipotent mesenchymal stem cell-like and reside in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue with the capacity to secrete a plethora of pro-regenerative growth factors. Future applications of ASCs may be restricted through (trans)national governmental policies that do not allow for use of nonhuman-derived (non-autologous) enzymes to isolate ASC. Besides, enzymatic isolation procedures are also time consuming. To overcome this issue, nonenzymatic isolation procedures to isolate ASCs or the SVF are being developed, such as the fractionation of adipose tissue procedure (FAT). This standardized procedure to isolate the stromal vascular fraction can be performed within 10-12 min. The short procedure time allows for intraoperative isolation of 1 mL of stromal vascular fraction derived from 10 mL of centrifuged adipose tissue. The stromal vascular fraction mostly contains blood vessels, extracellular matrix, and ASCs. However, based on the histological stainings an interdonor variation exists which might result in different therapeutic effects. The existing interdonor variations can be addressed by histological stainings and flow cytometry.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism. Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p&lt;0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic, deoxycholic and (iso)lithocholic acid after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.CONCLUSION: Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR4327.</p>

<p>Angiogenesis refers to blood vessel formation through endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Angiogenesis is crucial and beneficial for wound healing and tissue regeneration. In the current study, we prepared porous collagen and collagen/hyaluronan (Col/HA) scaffolds composed of collagen (7<U+202F>mg/mL) and hyaluronan (HA) (0.5 w%, 1 w%, and 1.5 w%) as culture vehicles for coculture of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These scaffolds were combined with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to investigate and evaluate angiogenesis in the coculture cell/scaffold constructs in vitro and in vivo. Scaffold porosity decreased (from 74.4% to 60.7%) and readily degraded after addition of various ratios of HA. The porous scaffolds all had high water content (~98%) and similar mechanical properties. The hADSCs alone and hADSCs cocultured with HUVECs exhibited stable proliferative profiles on the Col/HA scaffolds; furthermore, LIPUS significantly enhanced cell growth on the collagen and Col/0.5HA scaffolds by approximately 1.85- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with the cells that did not receive LIPUS treatment. In vivo immunohistochemistry results indicated stronger immunofluorescent CD31 presence and vascular endothelial cadherin messenger RNA expression in the hADSCs/HUVECs coculture/scaffold implantation in rats that received LIPUS treatment compared with those that received no such treatment. Our results demonstrated that the hADSCs/HUVECs cocultured on fabricated collagen and Col/HA scaffolds combined with LIPUS treatment had angiogenesis-promoting capability and therapeutic potential when angiogenesis is demanded.</p>

<p>Adipocyte development and adipose tissue expansion have many implications for human diseases, including obesity. Obesity is a debilitating disorder and a risk factor for metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, due in part to an overabundance of adipocytes and adipocyte dysfunction. In recent years, obesity has become a global pandemic with approximately one-third of US adults classified as obese. Adipose tissue has recently been identified as a major metabolic organ, classified into white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Other than lifestyle modifications and invasive surgeries, only a very limited number of drugs are available to treat obesity and overweight. P311 has been shown to play a key role in blood pressure regulation, vascular contractility and tissue remodeling. Here we present a role for P311 in adipogenesis using a 3T3-L1 cell culture model. P311 expression is initiated with the induction of adipogenesis and increased during adipogenesis. This increase correlates with an increase in the expression of the key adipogenic transcriptional factors PPAR<U+03B3>2 and C/EBPa. In addition, siRNA-mediated P311 knockdown inhibits adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Finally, P311 binds to the PPAR<U+03B3>2 promoter, implicating P311 mediates adipogenesis partly through PPAR<U+03B3> activation.</p>

<p>Evaluating cell migration after cell-based treatment is important for several disorders, including osteoarthritis (OA), as it might influence the clinical outcome. This research explores migrating expanded-adipose stromal cells (ASCs) and adipose niches after enzymatic and mechanical processes. Bilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection induced a mild grade of OA at eight weeks in adult male New Zealand rabbits. ASCs, enzymatic stromal vascular fraction (SVF), and micro fragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) were intra-articularly injected in the knee joint. Assessments of cell viability and expression of specific markers, including CD-163 wound-healing macrophages, were done. Cell migration was explored through labelling with PKH26 dye at 7 and 30 days alongside co-localization analyses for CD-146. All cells showed good viability and high percentages of CD-90 and CD-146. CD-163 was significantly higher in MFAT compared to SVF. Distinct migratory potential and time-dependent effects were observed among cell-based treatments. At day 7, both ASCs and SVF migrated towards synovium, whereas for MFAT versus cartilage, a different migration pattern was noticed at day 30. The long-term distinct cell migration of ASCs, SVF, and MFAT open interesting clinical insights on their potential use for OA treatment. Moreover, the highest expression of CD-163 in MFAT, rather than SVF, might have an important role in directly mediating cartilage tissue repair responses.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries, despite the evolution of treatments and revascularization strategies. Obesity, also accompanied by a chronic inflammatory process, is an independent risk factor for CVD. Abdominal adipose tissue is a complex, metabolically very active organ capable of producing different adipokines and hormones, responsible for endocrine-metabolic comorbidities. The epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has not been as extensively studied as the abdominal or subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, recent evidence associates it with an increased cardiometabolic risk due to its apposition with the heart. EAT stores triglycerides to provide energy to the myocardium and is characterized by its greater ability to release and capture free fatty acids. EAT strategic localization allows a singular cross talk with cardiomyocytes and vascular wall cells. The fact that EAT produces pro-inflammatory adipokines as well as metalloproteinases and pro-oxidant substances, highlights its possible direct impact on plaque vulnerability and heart failure, being still necessary further studies of EAT behavior in CVD.</p>

<p>This study explored the applicability, cellular efficacy, and osteogenic activities of porous nano-hydroxyapatite/Poly (glycerol sebacate)-grafted maleic anhydride (n-HA/PGS-g-M) composite scaffolds. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses indicated that approximately 43% of the hydroxide radicals in PGS were displaced by maleic anhydride. Resonance bands at 1036<U+2009>cm<sup>-1</sup> occurred in scaffolds containing nHA powders, and peak areas increased when n-HA weight increased in PGS-M-n-HA-0.4, PGS-M-n-HA-0.5, and PGS-M-n-HA-0.6 scaffolds. The n-HA/PGS-g-M composite scaffolds exhibited porous microstructure with average pore size of 150-300<U+2009>µm in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) identified the glass transition temperature (Tg) as -25-30<U+2009>°C, indicative of quality resilience. The modulus of compressibility increased when n-HA content increased. Interestingly, viability of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) in vitro and expression of the osteogenic related genes RUNX2, OCN, and COL1A1 was enhanced in the n-HA/PGS-g-M composite scaffolds compared to those factors observed in PGS-g-M scaffolds. Finally, simulated body fluid (SBF) tests indicated more apatite deposits on the surface of n-HA/PGS-g-M scaffolds compared to PGS-g-M scaffolds. Overall, porous n-HA/PGS-g-M composite scaffolds possessed acceptable biocompatibility and mechanical properties, and they stimulated hADSC cell proliferation and differentiation. Given these qualities, the composite scaffolds have potential applications in bone tissue engineering.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammation may underlie the association between obesity, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. We investigated to what extent markers of inflammation mediate associations between overall and visceral body fat and subclinical atherosclerosis.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that associations between measures of overall and visceral body fat and subclinical atherosclerosis are not mediated by inflammation as measured by CRP and GlycA. Obesity may exert cardiovascular risk via other markers of systemic inflammation.</p>

<p>Obesity-associated chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is partly attributed to hypoxia with insufficient microcirculation. Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, exerts an anti-inflammatory role in previous studies. Here, we investigate its effects on inflammation, hypoxia and microcirculation in white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice were injected intraperitoneally with exenatide or normal saline for 4 weeks, while mice on chow diet were used as normal controls. The mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, hypoxia-induced genes and angiogenic factors were detected. Capillary density was measured by laser confocal microscopy and immunochemistry staining. After 4-week exenatide administration, the dramatically elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and adipose tissue and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue of DIO mice were significantly reduced. Exenatide also ameliorated expressions of hypoxia-related genes in obese fat tissue. Proteins levels of endothelial markers and pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor and its recpetor 2 were augmented in accordance with increased capillary density by exenatide in DIO mice. Our results indicate that inflammation and hypoxia in adipose tissue can be mitigated by GLP-1 receptor agonist potentially via improved angiogenesis and microcirculation in obesity.</p>

<p>AIM: The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with hypertension on telomerase activity, visfatin and adipsine concentration in the blood and vascular endothelial function assessed by ultrasound measured flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMD).MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved a group of 106 people (average age: 54.79 years). The determination of telomerase activity and blood visfatin and adipsine concentrations, brachial artery ultrasound examination with endothelium-dependent dilatation evaluation (FMD) and polysomnography were carried out.RESULTS: Patients with hypertension without OSA were characterized by significantly greater FMD in comparison to patients with arterial hypertension and OSA (8.13<U+202F>±<U+202F>5.12 %vs. 6.82<U+202F>±<U+202F>5.36%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). Negative linear relationship between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and FMD (r<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.22, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05) has been demonstrated. Negative linear relationship between adipsine concentration in the blood and length of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep (r<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.21, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05) was found. Positive linear relationship between the concentration of visfatin in the blood and the length of REM sleep (r<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.22, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05) was also observed. Higher body mass index, higher total cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose levels have been shown to be independent predictors of higher AHI values, while greater telomerase activity, greater FMD and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are independent predicators for lower AHI values.CONCLUSION: Higher values of AHI index in polysomnography in hypertensive patients can be related to lower telomerase activity in the blood and impaired function of vascular endothelial function assessed using ultrasound.</p>

<p>miRNAs are important immune regulators in the control of the CD4<U+202F>+<U+202F>T cells phenotype. miR-326 regulates the differentiation towards Th17 cells and the inhibition of miR-155 is associated with low levels of Treg cells. However, miRNAs expression and transcription factors associated with these lymphocyte subsets in obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation is still unknown. The aim of this work was to identify Th17 cells in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), proinflammatory cytokine production and their association with the miRNAs and transcription factors involved. We collected SAT samples obtained by lipoaspiration from individuals with normal weight, overweight and obesity. We obtained the stromal vascular fractions and then a Ficoll gradient was performed to obtain adipose tissue mononuclear cells (ATMC). Th17 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and the expression of miR-326, miR-155, RORC2 and FOXP3 by qRT-PCR. We also analyzed cytokines from the supernatants of the ATMC culture and measured the FOXP3 methylation percentage by bisulfite conversion by PCR. According to the results, the frequency of Th17 cells and RORC2 expression was higher in individuals with obesity and associated with miR-326 expression. The ATMC from this group secreted a proinflammatory cytokine profile by in vitro assay. In contrast, lower levels of mRNA FOXP3 expression was detected in ATMC from individuals with obesity that correlated with methylation percentage of FOXP3 gene but no association with miR-155 was detected. Our results suggested that miR-326 participates in the polarization towards Th17 promoting the inflammatory state in the obesity-induced adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Petite Integration Factor 1 (PIF1) is a multifunctional helicase present in nuclei and mitochondria. PIF1 knock out (KO) mice exhibit accelerated weight gain and decreased wheel running on a normal chow diet. In the current study, we investigated whether Pif1 ablation alters whole body metabolism in response to weight gain. PIF1 KO and wild type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were fed a Western diet (WD) rich in fat and carbohydrates before evaluation of their metabolic phenotype. Compared with weight gain-resistant WT female mice, WD-fed PIF1 KO females, but not males, showed accelerated adipose deposition, decreased locomotor activity, and reduced whole-body energy expenditure without increased dietary intake. Surprisingly, PIF1 KO females did not show obesity-induced alterations in fasting blood glucose and glucose clearance. WD-fed PIF1 KO females developed mild hepatic steatosis and associated changes in liver gene expression that were absent in weight-matched, WD-fed female controls, linking hepatic steatosis to Pif1 ablation rather than increased body weight. WD-fed PIF1 KO females also showed decreased expression of inflammation-associated genes in adipose tissue. Collectively, these data separated weight gain from inflammation and impaired glucose homeostasis. They also support a role for Pif1 in weight gain resistance and liver metabolic dysregulation during nutrient stress.</p>

<p>Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation that contributes to development of cardiometabolic disorders. Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) antagonists attenuate diet-induced obesity (DIO) and related inflammation, although the precise anti-inflammatory mechanisms involved have not been fully explored. In the current study we used a mouse model of DIO intervention to determine the microRNA (miRNA, miR)-mediated anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory effects of the CB1 antagonist, AM251. DIO mice that were fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks were treated with AM251 (10 mg/kg) for an additional 4 weeks. HFD + AM251 mice experienced rapid and prolonged weight loss and reduced inflammatory M1 adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) infiltration. To investigate miRNA-mediated regulation of ATMs, F4/80+ cells from stromal vascular fractions (SVF) of epididymal fat were subjected to miR microarray analysis. Several miRs were differentially expressed in AM251-treated mice that were independent of calorie restriction. Prominently, miR-30e-5p was upregulated in ATMs from HFD + AM251 mice while the miR-30e-5p target, DLL4, was downregulated. Consistent with a decrease in DLL4-Notch signaling, fat storage and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was reduced following AM251 treatment. Furthermore, we found that AM251-treated macrophages can suppress DLL4-mediated Th1 polarization in CD4+ T cells. Together these data demonstrate that blocking CB1 receptors leads to upregulation of miR-30e-5p and down regulation of DLL4 in ATMs, which in turn suppress DLL4-Notch signaling-induced polarization of inflammatory Th1 cells and adipocyte energy storage. This combined effect of ATMs and T cells leads to an anti-inflammatory state and attenuation of DIO. These data support therapeutic potential of miR-30 in the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders.</p>

<p>The evaluation of stress-induced myocardial perfusion defects by non-invasive myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) modalities has a leading role in the identification of coronary artery disease, and has excellent diagnostic and prognostic value. Non-invasive MPI can be performed using conventional and novel gamma cameras or by PET/CT. New software has allowed novel parameters that may have a role in the identification of early marks of cardiac impairment to be evaluated. We aim to give an overview of niche parameters obtainable by single photon emission CT (SPECT) and PET/CT MPI that may help practitioners to detect initial signs of cardiac damage and identify new therapy targets. In particular, we summarise the role of left ventricular geometry indices for remodelling, phase analysis parameters to evaluate mechanical dyssynchrony, the concept of relative flow reserve in the evaluation of flow-limiting epicardial stenosis, vascular age and epicardial adipose tissue as early markers of atherosclerotic burden, and emerging parameters for the evaluation of myocardial innervation, such as the total defect score.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is an important endocrine organ with a role in many cardiometabolic diseases. It is comprised of a heterogeneous collection of cell types that can differentially impact disease phenotypes. Cellular heterogeneity can also confound -omic analyses but is rarely taken into account in analysis of solid-tissue transcriptomes. Here, we investigate cell-type heterogeneity in two population-level subcutaneous adipose-tissue RNA-seq datasets (TwinsUK, n = 766 and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project [GTEx], n = 326) by estimating the relative proportions of four distinct cell types (adipocytes, macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and micro-vascular endothelial cells). We find significant cellular heterogeneity within and between the TwinsUK and GTEx adipose datasets. We find that adipose cell-type composition is heritable and confirm the positive association between adipose-resident macrophage proportion and obesity (high BMI), but we find a stronger BMI-independent association with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived body-fat distribution traits. We benchmark the impact of adipose-tissue cell composition on a range of standard analyses, including phenotype-gene expression association, co-expression networks, and cis-eQTL discovery. Our results indicate that it is critical to account for cell-type composition when combining adipose transcriptome datasets in co-expression analysis and in differential expression analysis with obesity-related traits. We applied gene expression by cell-type proportion interaction models (G × Cell) to identify 26 cell-type-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 20 genes, including four autoimmune disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. These results identify cell-specific eQTLs and demonstrate the potential of in silico deconvolution of bulk tissue to identify cell-type-restricted regulatory variants.</p>

<p>Relatively few imaging and sensing technologies are employed to study human lactation physiology. In particular, human mammary development during pregnancy as well as mammary involution after lactation have been poorly described, despite their importance for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment during these phases. Our case study shows the potential of diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) to uniquely study the spatiotemporal changes in mammary tissue composition during the involution of the lactating breast toward its pre-pregnant state. At nine time intervals over a period of eight months after the cessation of breastfeeding, we reconstructed 2-D maps of mammary water content, lipid content, total hemoglobin (THb) concentration, oxygen saturation (StO2), and tissue optical scattering. Mammary lipid content in the nonareolar region showed a significant relative increase of 59%, whereas water content and THb concentration showed a significant relative decrease of 50% and 48%, respectively. Significant changes were also found in StO2 and tissue optical scattering. Our findings are consistent with the gradual replacement of fibroglandular tissue by adipose tissue and vascular regression during mammary involution. Moreover, our data provide unique insight into the dynamics of breast tissue composition and demonstrate the effectiveness of DOSI as a technique to study human lactation physiology.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is now on the top one of stem cell sources regarding its accessibility, abundance, and less painful collection procedure when compared to other sources. The adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) that it contains can be maintained and expanded in culture for long periods of time without losing their differentiation capacity, leading to large cell quantities being increasingly used in cell therapy purposes. Many reports showed that ADSCs-based cell therapy products demonstrated optimal efficacy and efficiency in some clinical indications for both autologous and allogeneic purposes, hence becoming considered as potential tools for replacing, repairing, and regenerating dead or damaged cells. In this review, we analyzed the therapeutic advancement of ADSCs in comparison to bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord (UC)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and designed the specific requirements to their best clinical practices and safety. Our analysis was focused on the ADSCs, rather than the whole stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell populations, to facilitate characterization that is related to their source of origins. Clinical outcomes improvement suggested that these cells hold great promise in stem cell-based therapies in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and auto-immunes diseases.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Heme oxygenase (HO-1) plays a critical role in adipogenesis and it is important to understand its function in obesity. Many studies have shown that upregulation of HO-1 can affect the biologic parameters in obesity-mediated diabetes, hypertension and vascular endothelial cell function. Thus, we aimed to explore the hypothesis that upregulation of HO-1, using a pharmacologic approach as well as gene targeting, would improve both adiposity and endothelial cell dysfunction by direct targeting of endothelial cells. Our second aim was to compare the short-term effect of a HO-1 inducer, cobalt-protoporphrin IX (CoPP), with the long-term effects of gene targeted therapy on vascular and adipocyte stem cells in obese mice.METHOD: We examined the effect of CoPP on fat pre-adipocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We also used a lentiviral construct that expressed heme oxygenase (HO-1) that was under the control of an endothelium specific promoter, vascular endothelium cadherin (VECAD) heme oxygenase (VECAD-HO-1). We targeted endothelial cells using vascular endothelium cadherin/green fluorescent protein fusion construct (VECAD-GFP) as the control. Conditioned media (CM) from endothelial cells (EC) was added to fat derived adipocytes. Additionally, we treated renal interlobar arteries with phenylephrine and dosed cumulative increments of acetylcholine both with and without exposure to CoPP. We did the same vascular reactivity experiments with VECAD-HO-1 lentiviral construct compared to the control.RESULTS: CoPP improved vascular reactivity and decreased adipogenesis compared to the control. MSCs exposed to CM from EC transfected with VECAD-HO-1 showed decreased adipogenesis, smaller lipid droplet size and decreased PPAR-<U+03B3>, C/EBP and increased Wnt 10b compared to the control. HO-1 upregulation had a direct effect on reducing adipogenesis. This effect was blocked by tin mesoporphrin (SnMP). EC treated with VECAD-HO-1 expressed lower levels of ICAM and VCAM compared to the control, suggesting improved EC function. This also improved ACH induced vascular reactivity. These effects were also reversed by SnMP. The effect of viral transfection was much more specific and sustained than the effects of pharmacologic therapy, CoPP.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a pharmacological inducer of HO-1 such as CoPP improves endothelial cell function while dampening adipogenesis, but long-term HO-1 expression by direct targeting of endothelial cells by gene transfer therapy may offer a more specific and ideal solution. This was evidenced by smaller healthier adipocytes that had improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting increased adiponectin levels. HO-1 upregulation reestablished the “crosstalk” between perivascular adipose tissue and the vascular system that was lost in the chronic inflammatory state of obesity. This study demonstrates that gene targeting of EC may well be the future direction in treating obesity induced EC dysfunction, with the finding that targeting the vasculature had a direct and sustained effect on adipogenesis.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Metabolic surgery has become an accepted option for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases like hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue dysfunction and ectopic storage of excess lipids are thought to be involved in the underlying pathophysiological process.OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to clarify the effect of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on adipose tissue microvasculature and health in an animal model of adipose type 2 diabetes.METHODS: After weaning, diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats were either fed on standard rat chow or high-calorie diet. At 4 months, animals on high-calorie diet were randomized to SG, sham surgery, or control group. Non-diabetic Wistar rats served as further controls. At 6 months, glucose and lipid metabolisms were studied in vivo. After sacrifice, periepididymal adipose tissue was collected for histology and analysis of parameters of adipose tissue metabolism and insulin sensitivity.RESULTS: SG decreased body and adipose tissue weight and improved glycemic and lipid profiles. Fasting glycemia, area under the curve after intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test, and insulin resistance were decreased in operated animals. SG also reduced circulating triglycerides and cholesterol while increasing serum adiponectin and adipose tissue peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR-<U+03B3>) and perilipin A. Additionally, surgery improved adipose tissue vascular function and markedly increased vascular endothelial growth factor, cluster of differentiation 31, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase.CONCLUSIONS: In our obese animal model of type 2 diabetes, SG significantly improved adipose tissue health and angiogenesis while reducing insulin resistance, involving PPAR-<U+03B3> and markers of sprouting angiogenesis and endothelial function.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly heart failure (HF) and coronary heart disease (CHD). The mechanisms through which obesity increases CVD risk involve changes in body composition that can affect hemodynamics and alters heart structure. Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the adipose tissue itself which can induce cardiac dysfunction and can promote the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. When obesity and HF or CHD coexist, individuals with class I obesity present a more favorable prognosis compared to individuals who are normal or underweight. This phenomenon has been termed the “obesity paradox.” Obesity is defined as an excess fat mass (FM), but individuals with obesity typically also present with an increased amount of lean mass (LM). The increase in LM may explain part of the obesity paradox as it is associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), a major determinant of clinical outcomes in the general population, but particularly in those with CVD, including HF. While increased LM is a stronger prognosticator in HF compared to FM, in patients with CHD excess FM can exert protective effects particularly when not associated with increased systemic inflammation. In the present review, we discuss the mechanisms through which obesity may increase the risk for CVD, and how it may exert protective effects in the setting of established CVD, with a focus on body composition. We also highlight the importance of measuring or estimating CRF, including body composition-adjusted measures of CRF (ie, lean peak oxygen consumption) for an improved risk status stratification in patients with CVD and finally, we discuss the potential non-pharmacologic therapeutics, such as exercise training and dietary interventions, aimed at improving CRF and perhaps clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (IFPSCs) are emerging as an alternative to adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from other sources. They are a reliable source of autologous stem cells obtained from medical waste that are suitable for use in cell-based therapy, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Such clinical applications require a vast number of high-quality IFPSCs. Unlike embryonic stem cells (ESCs), ADSCs and IFPSCs have limited population doubling capacity; however, in vitro expansion of primary IFPSCs through multiple passages (referred to as P) is a crucial step to acquire the desired population of cells. The present study investigated the effect of multiple passages on the stemness of IFPSCs during expansion and the possibility of predicting the loss of stemness using certain markers. IFPSCs were isolated from infrapatellar fat pad tissue resected during knee arthroplasty performed on aged patients (&gt;65 years old). These cells from the stromal vascular fraction were serially passaged to at least to P7, and their stemness characteristics were examined at each passage. It was observed that IFPSCs maintained their spindle-shaped morphology, self-renewability and homogeneity at P2-4. Furthermore, immunostaining revealed that these cells expressed mesenchymal stem cell (CD166, CD90 and CD105) and ESC markers [Sox2, Nanog, Oct4 and nucleostemin (NS)], whereas the hematopoietic stem cell marker CD45 was absent. These cells were also able to differentiate into the three germ layer cell types, thus confirming their ability to generate clinical grade cells. The findings indicated that prolonged culture of IFPSCs (P&gt;6) led to the loss of the stem cell proliferative marker NS, with an increased population doubling time and progression toward neuronal differentiation, acquiring a neurogenic phenotype. Additionally, IFPSCs demonstrated an inherent ability to secrete neurotrophic factors and express receptors for these factors, which is the cause of neuronal differentiation at later passages. Therefore, these findings validated NS as a prognostic indicator for impaired stemness and identified IFPSCs as a promising source for cell-based therapy, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue inflammation is a reproducible feature of obesity and obesity-linked insulin resistance. Although sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) deficiency has previously been implicated in diet-induced obesity and systemic insulin resistance, the adipocyte-specific role of Sirt6 in the regulation of adipose tissue inflammation and systemic metabolic dysfunction in mice fed normal chow and in humans remains elusive. Here, using Adipoq-Cre-mediated adipocyte-specific Sirt6 knockout (aS6KO) mice, we explored whether adipocyte Sirt6 inhibits adipose tissue inflammation and its underlying mechanism. aS6KO mice fed normal chow gained more body weight and fat mass than wild-type mice and exhibited glucose intolerance and systemic insulin resistance. Measurement of plasma and tissue cytokines and flow cytometric analysis of adipose stromal vascular cells indicated a decrease in alternatively activated M2 macrophages in the adipose tissue of aS6KO mice. Mechanistically, Sirt6 regulated the expression of the canonical type 2 cytokine IL-4 by adipocytes in a cell autonomous manner, which in turn affects M2 macrophage polarization. Consistent with animal experimental data, the degree of obesity and insulin resistance demonstrated by the body mass index, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c correlated negatively with the expression of Sirt6 in human visceral fat tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that adipocyte Sirt6 regulates body weight gain and insulin sensitivity independent of diet, and the increased IL-4 production by Sirt6 and resultant M2 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages may attenuate proinflammatory responses in adipose tissue.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Delivery of endothelial cells into the ischemic tissue is emerging as an alternative approach in revascularization of injured tissues by means of angiogenesis to restore organ function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a readily accessible source of the mesenchymal stem cell with rapid expansion and multidifferentiation potential. The view has emerged that endothelial cells (ECs) differentiated from ASCs is a step forward for adult vascular repair in regenerative medicine and construction of the blood vessel by tissue engineering approach.METHODS: In this study, differentiation of human ASCs (hASCs) into vascular EC lineage was induced by combined treatment of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) under hypoxia condition. The expression of CD31, VEGF-R2, and VE-cadherin was determined by immunofluorescent staining, real-time PCR, and western blot analysis. These differentiated cells acquired functional characteristics of mature ECs as determined by their tube formation ability, DiI-ac-LDL uptake, and nitric oxide secretion in vitro. The methylation status in the proximal promoter CpGs was determined by bisulfite sequencing.RESULTS: hASCs expressed endothelial cell markers including CD31, VEGF-R2, and VE-cadherin by combined treatment of VEGF and BMP4 under hypoxia condition. These differentiated cells exhibited the angiogenesis potential in vitro, and injection of these differentiated cells enhanced angiogenesis in the ischemic hindlimb of diabetic mice. Furthermore, it was found that hypoxia increased significantly EphrinB2 expression EC differentiation, which is greatly downregulated with EphrinB2 blockage. The methylation status in the proximal promoter CpG results showed that methylation of EphrinB2 promoter decreased in hASCs with exposure to hypoxia.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that hASCs can be efficiently induced to differentiate into vascular EC lineages which are mediated by demethylation of ephrinB2 under hypoxia condition.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Decellularized xenogenic vascular tissue has potential applications in small-diameter tissue engineering vascular grafts. Decellularization removes most xenogenic antigen and leaves most of the extracellular matrix for cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. Recellularization is recognized as an important step to improve the endothelialization of decellularized vascular grafts in vivo and most studies used endothelial cells for recellularization. However, there have been no studies on applying undifferentiated adipose stem cells (ASCs) in recellularization.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of decellularized porcine coronary artery (DPCA) with ASC recellularization as tissue-engineered vascular grafts by in vitro cell biocompatibility and in vivo aorta repair tests. Porcine coronary artery was decellularized with the enzyme-detergent method and characterized by histology and biochemical methods. In vitro biocompatibility was tested by human and rat adipose stem cells (hASCs/rASCs). In vivo, potential for endothelialization of ASC-seeded DPCA scaffolds were evaluated by rat aorta patch repair model.RESULTS: In vitro, hASCs and rASCs could adhere and maintain cell viability on DPCA scaffold. In vivo, rat abdominal aorta repair model revealed that DPCA with rat ASC seeding had a 100% patency rate. Grossly, there was integration between host tissue and graft tissue, and no leakage or rupture was observed. Histologically, DPCA with rat ASC seeding displayed endothelialization on the luminal side. In addition, the layer structure was preserved with collagen deposition. However, intimal hyperplasia was noted.CONCLUSION: This preliminary study indicates that DPCA with undifferentiated ASC seeding exhibited cell biocompatibility in vitro and endothelialization in vivo. DPCA with ASC recellularization has potential for use in the development of small-diameter tissue engineering vascular grafts.</p>

<p>A growing body of evidence is pointing out the pathophysiological role of fat accumulation in different organs. Ectopic fat depots within heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas as well as around blood vessels might be more associated to cardiometabolic risk than classical variables, such as body mass index. Among different mechanisms, lipid metabolism appears to be particularly influenced by ectopic fat depots. Indeed, intracellular accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids, and triglycerides promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial uncoupling, oxidative stress, and altered membrane composition/function, finally promoting inflammatory response and cell death. The dysfunctional adipose tissue was shown to induce both local and systemic effects, with relevant clinical consequences. Epicardial fat and myocardial steatosis have been associated with the development of atrial fibrillation and ventricular dysfunction. Similarly perivascular adipose tissue appears to trigger atherosclerosis and hypertension. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized both as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and as a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. Importantly, the renal sinus fat emerged as a potential player in kidney dysfunction. Finally, both skeletal muscle and pancreatic fat depots have been indicated as potential endocrine modulators of insulin resistance. Considering the global rise in the prevalence of obesity, the understanding of mechanisms underlying ectopic fat accumulation represents an urgent need, with potential clinical implications for CV risk stratification. Here, we attempt to update the current knowledge of the different ectopic fat depots, focusing on underlying mechanisms and potential clinical implications.</p>

Previous studies reported a relation between valve diseases and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness. The aim of this study was to verify the possible relationship between the molecular pattern of EAT related to IL-13 fibrogenic cytokine expression and valve dysfunction.METHODS AND RESULTS: A valvular heart disease (VHD) population was stratified according to their median EAT thickness (7<U+202F>mm). The molecular expression of IL-13 in EAT is directly related to the molecular expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, macrophage infiltration and promotion of the formation of ectopic calcific nodules involved in aorta coarctation and calcification.CONCLUSION: IL-13 gene expression in altered EAT is directly related to the expression of genes involved in ECM turnover and the formation of ectopic calcific nodules, suggesting measurements of EAT as a stratification risk factor for valve instability in the VHD patients.</p>

<p>The purpose of the work was to study the dynamics of changes in the histological parameters of the pancreas traumatic tissues in various types of mechanical injuries depending on the prescription of caused injuries. The material for the study included tissues of 64 male and female pancreases, aged from 20 to 60 who died at a known and an unknown time of injury with and without alcohol in blood. These people were subjected to autopsy in anatomical department of Forensic Medical Examination Bureau in Lugansk region. In the conducted research we used histological and histochemical techniques to detect dynamic processes of regeneration histological parameters of pancreas injured tissues and performed statistical analysis of the results. According to our data, the thoraco-abdominal injury from the pancreas damage showed at the histological examination (up to 6 hours from the moment of injury) red blood cells with clear contours, leukostasis in vessels, leukocyte accumulation perivascularly, and leukocyte hemorrhages located in diffuse spaces of the injury zone. Stromal edema was also detected. Symptoms of fatty necrosis began to appear. 6-12 hours after injury, the hemorrhage got the form of a cluster of erythrocytes with clear contours, but erythrocytes in the center of hemorrhages were fuzzy, the number of leukocytes in the blood vessels and tissues increased, and concentrated perifocally. In some cases, hemorrhages were detected in the adipose tissue, which was located around the pancreas, with neuroticism of the parenchyma of the pancreas, which was adjacent to the aforementioned zone. After 12-24 hours, erythrocytes turned into granular masses; cells of necrotic tissues appeared on the spot. In the foci of perifocal inflammation, leukocytes reveal macrophages, lymphoid cells that contained intracellular granular pigment (hemosiderin). Edema was distributed. Inflammatory infiltration increased simultaneously and the number of fatty necrosis, on the contrary, decreased. On the 2-3 days, the demarcation line around the parenchymal necrosis and surrounding adipose tissue was well distinguished. In this period there was a well-developed widespread leukocyte infiltration, a large number of fatty necrosis, and the swelling was spreading. In infiltrates among leukocytes there were lymphocytes, macrophages, isolated histiocytes. In the period of 4-6 days after the injury the number of fatty necrosis continued to increase, the number of lymphocytes, macrophages, histiocytes in the infiltration zone increased. This was the moment of the demarcation line emerging. After 6 days the exclusion of necrotic tissue began in the injury zone with the transformation of the peripheral cell infiltration into the lymphostiocyte. There was proliferation of fibroblasts in the walls of capillaries, which lasted for 1-2 weeks. After the first 2 weeks, we could observe a consistent proliferation of fibroblasts, and the formation of delicate connective tissue fibers. Young blood vessels started to appear. The obtained research results indicate that our data coincide with literary sources, which indicate that traumatic damage to the pancreas is characterized by high lethality ranging from 15 to 40% (literary data) and up to 28% according to our data. In the course of the study, we established natural changes in histological parameters of pancreatic tissue, depending on the prescription of injury, taking into account the time of death, the presence of a traumatic illness, etc. These parameters help the forensic investigator in solving the urgent issues of deciding the prescription of injury and the sequences of events causing damage to the injured and dead people with mechanical trauma.</p>

<p>The use of stem cells has been reported to improve hair regrowth in several therapeutic strategies, including reversing the pathological mechanisms, that contribute to hair loss, regeneration of hair follicles, or creating hair using the tissue-engineering approach. Although various promising stem cell approaches are progressing via pre-clinical models to clinical trials, intraoperative stem cell treatments with a one-step procedure offer a quicker result by incorporating an autologous cell source without manipulation, which may be injected by surgeons through a well-established clinical practice. Many authors have concentrated on adipose-derived stromal vascular cells due to their ability to separate into numerous cell genealogies, platelet-rich plasma for its ability to enhance cell multiplication and neo-angiogenesis, as well as human follicle mesenchymal stem cells. In this paper, the significant improvements in intraoperative stem cell approaches, from in vivo models to clinical investigations, are reviewed. The potential regenerative instruments and functions of various cell populaces in the hair regrowth process are discussed. The addition of Wnt signaling in dermal papilla cells is considered a key factor in stimulating hair growth. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived signaling and growth factors obtained by platelets influence hair growth through cellular proliferation to prolong the anagen phase (FGF-7), induce cell growth (ERK activation), stimulate hair follicle development (ß-catenin), and suppress apoptotic cues (Bcl-2 release and Akt activation).</p>

<p>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetic disorder characterized by the progressive substitution of functional myocardium with noncontractile fibro-fatty tissue contributing to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a ubiquitous protein involved in several pathological mechanisms, which also characterize ACM (i.e., fibrosis, inflammation, and adipogenesis). Nevertheless, the involvement of CyPA in ACM cardiac remodeling has not been investigated yet. Thus, we first evaluated CyPA expression levels in the right ventricle (RV) tissue specimens obtained from ACM patients and healthy controls (HC) by immunohistochemistry. Then, we took advantage of ACM- and HC-derived cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells (C-MSC) to assess CyPA modulation during adipogenic differentiation. Interestingly, CyPA was more expressed in the RV sections obtained from ACM vs. HC subjects and positively correlated with the adipose replacement extent. Moreover, CyPA was upregulated at early stages of C-MSC adipogenic differentiation and was secreted at higher level over time in ACM- derived C-MSC. Our study provides novel ex vivo and in vitro information on CyPA expression in ACM remodeling paving the way for future C-MSC-based mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.</p>

<p>Obesity is closely associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, including dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Adipose tissue (AT) is identified as a complex endocrine organ, with a wide range of regulatory functions at the cellular, tissue and systemic levels. Various terms, including paracardiac, epicardial and pericardial, are used to describe the fatty deposits surrounding the heart. Among all the fat depots, perivascular AT (PVAT) is of great biological significance for the cardiovascular system due to its anatomical proximity to the vessels. Recent studies have shown the presence of a complex, bidirectional paracrine and vasocardial signaling system between the vascular wall and PVAT. In the review, we will discuss the biological role of PVAT in both the physiological state and cardiovascular pathology, emphasizing its dual proatherogenic and antiatherogenic role. Let us consider PVAT as a target for various therapeutic agents in cardiovascular diseases. We will also analyze data on the role of non-invasive techniques as a diagnostic tool for assessing coronary artery inflammation.</p>

<p>Butein is a plant flavonoid chalcone, with presumed anti-adipogenic properties. It was reported to impair preadipocyte differentiation, limit adipose tissue (AT) development and enhance white AT browning in rodents. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that these effects of butein may occur via reduction of ADAMTS5 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin motifs 5) expression. Murine 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes in the presence of butein or vehicle. At regular time intervals RNA was collected for gene expression studies. Male hemizygous mice for Tg(Ucp1-luc2,-tdTomato)1Kajim (ThermoMouse) were exposed to butein or vehicle, after which ATs were analyzed for Adamts5 and uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp-1) mRNA level changes. During preadipocyte differentiation, butein (25 - 50 mM) did not affect Adamts5 or Ucp-1 expression. Oil Red O analysis and monitoring of differentiation markers failed to demonstrate effects of butein on the differentiation extent. Furthermore, butein administration to the ThermoMouse (10 or 20 mg/kg, 4 days) or to the C57BL6/Rj mice (20 mg/kg, 4 weeks) did not enhance Adamts5 or Ucp-1 expression. Thus, we could not demonstrate marked effects of butein on the preadipocyte differentiation extent or AT development and browning, nor on Adamts5 or Ucp-1 gene expression during these processes.</p>

<p>AIM: Studies showed an increased visceral adipose tissue and peritoneal angiogenesis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, the relationship between the visceral adipose expands and peritoneal angiogenesis remains unclear.METHODS: Pref-1 (preadipocyte factor-1) recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) and control AAV were constructed. Mice were divided into four groups, mice in control and PD group were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, mice in control-AAV-PD were injected intraperitoneally with plaque-forming unit (PFU) control AAV and mice in pref-1-AAV-PD group were injected with PFU recombinant AAV. Two weeks later, control group was injected intraperitoneally with normal saline while other groups were injected intraperitoneally with 4.25% peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF). Thirty days later, viscerall adipose tissue was collected and weighed. Pref-1 protein expression was measured by Western blot, and peritoneal permeability was measured by Evans blue. Cluster of differentiation 31(CD31) immunohistochemical staining was used to detect mesenteric blood vessel number, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Pref-1 protein expression increased in pref-1-AAV-PD group. Visceral adipose expanded in PD and control-AAV-PD group while decreased in pref-1-AAV-PD group, which approves PD fluid enhance visceral adipogensis, and the process could be inhibited by Pref-1 recombinant AAV. The reduction of peritoneal vessel number and the decrease of vascular permeability as well as down-regulation of serum vascular endothelial growth factor observed in pref-1-AAV-PD group suggested peritoneal angiogenesis could be inhibited following visceral adipose tissue reduction.CONCLUSION: Visceral adipose expands is associated with peritoneal angiogenesis in PD treatment, and prevention of visceral adipogenesis may be an alternative way to protect the validity of peritoneum.

<p>The increasing prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents is a serious public health concern. Hypertriglyceridemia is common in obese children and adolescents, and elevated triglyceride (TG) level is a known biomarker of cardiometabolic risk. Results from genetic studies suggest that TG and TG-rich lipoproteins and, more specifically, remnant cholesterol are in the causal pathway of cardiovascular disease. However, simultaneous measurement of all remnants has not yet been established, and plasma TG level can be used as a useful marker of remnant cholesterol. Adipose tissue dysfunction, including impaired adipocyte TG storage and release of fatty acids, mediates the development of obesity-related complications. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia increases in overweight or obese children and is associated with other cardiometabolic risk factors. Recently, the TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio was recognized as a marker of structural vascular changes and insulin resistance in obese youth. Recent guidelines recommend universal lipid screening with nonfasting non-HDL-C measurement in children at 9-11 years of age; however, fasting lipid profiles should be measured in obese children and overweight adolescents and in those with high non-HDL-C in universal screening. The primary approach to lower TG in children includes dietary and lifestyle modifications; however, children with severe hypertriglyceridemia should also be referred to a pediatric lipid specialist.</p>

<p>Aging is an independent risk factor for vascular diseases. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), an active component of the vasculature, contributes to vascular dysfunction during aging. Identification of underlying cell types and their changes during aging may provide meaningful insights regarding the clinical relevance of aging-related vascular diseases. Here, we take advantage of single-cell RNA sequence to characterize the resident stromal cells in the PVAT (PVASCs) and identified different clusters between young and aged PVASCs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed decreased endothelial and brown adipogenic differentiation capacities of PVASCs during aging, which contributed to neointimal hyperplasia after perivascular delivery to ligated carotid arteries. Mechanistically, in vitro and in vivo studies both suggested that aging-induced loss of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator-1 a (PGC1a) was a key regulator of decreased brown adipogenic differentiation in senescent PVASCs. We further demonstrated the existence of human PVASCs (hPVASCs) and overexpression of PGC1a improved hPVASC delivery-induced vascular remodeling. Our finding emphasizes that differentiation capacities of PVASCs alter during aging and loss of PGC1a in aged PVASCs contributes to vascular remodeling via decreased brown adipogenic differentiation.</p>

<p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) function may depend on its anatomical location and developmental origin. Interscapular BAT (iBAT) regulates acute macronutrient metabolism, whilst perivascular BAT (PVAT) regulates vascular function. Although phenotypically similar, whether these depots respond differently to acute nutrient excess is unclear. Given their distinct anatomical locations and developmental origins and we hypothesised that iBAT and PVAT would respond differently to brief period of nutrient excess. Sprague-Dawley rats aged 12 weeks (n=12) were fed either a standard (10% fat, n=6) or high fat diet (HFD: 45% fat, n=6) for 72h and housed at thermoneutrality. Following an assessment of whole body physiology, fat was collected from both depots for analysis of gene expression and the proteome. HFD consumption for 72h induced rapid weight gain (c. 2.6%) and reduced serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) with no change in either total adipose or depot mass. In iBAT, an upregulation of genes involved in insulin signalling and lipid metabolism was accompanied by enrichment of lipid-related processes and functions, plus glucagon and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathways. In PVAT, HFD induced a pronounced down-regulation of multiple metabolic pathways which was accompanied with increased abundance of proteins involved in apoptosis (e.g. Hdgf and Ywaq) and toll-like receptor signalling (Ube2n). There was also an enrichment of DNA-related processes and functions (e.g. nucleosome assembly and histone exchange) and RNA degradation and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, we show that iBAT and PVAT elicit divergent responses to short-term nutrient excess highlighting early adaptations in these depots before changes in fat mass.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The degree of intravascular enhancement influences the diagnosis of plaque in coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA).PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the protocol tailored to body surface area (BSA) achieving identical enhancement in different habitus patients receiving different concentration contrast agents (CA) in coronary CTA.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary CTA randomly received a different concentration of CA with a protocol adapted to BSA. Attenuation and standard deviation were measured at ascending aorta (AAo), left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), paraspinal muscle and peri-coronary adipose tissue. Attenuation and Contrast-to-Noise-Ratio (CNR) were compared among CA groups and BMI-subgroups. Data were compared using ANOVA one-way test, paired Student t test, chi-square test and Kappa test.RESULTS: In different CA concentration groups, there were no significant differences in attenuation of AAo (477.72, 486.98, 474.50 HU, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.29), LAD proximal (478.47, 487.50, 476.21 HU, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25) and distal portion (448.81, 451.94, 443.83 HU, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.28), RCA proximal (463.11, 465.60, 479.66 HU, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.09) and distal portion (438.90, 441.36, 448.49 HU, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.27). The enhancement of coronary distal portion were lower than proximal portion (all P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). No significant differences in CNR of LAD (43.24, 47.37, 44.47, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.12) and RCA (51.74, 50.86, 51.86, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.77) were found among CA groups. There were no significant differences in vascular enhancement among BMI-subgroups (all P<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>0.05). Overall subjective image quality and agreement were good.CONCLUSION: With the CA injection protocol tailored to BSA, it is feasible to obtain consistent contrast enhancement and image quality in coronary CTA, regardless of CA concentration and patient habitus.</p>

<p>The critical role of the left atrium (LA) in cardiovascular homoeostasis is mediated by its reservoir, conduit, systolic, and neurohormonal functions. Atrial fibrillation is generally a reflection of underlying disease of the LA, especially in patients with heart failure. Disease-related LA remodelling leads to a decline in both atrial contractility and distensibility along with an impairment in the control of neurohormonal systems that regulate intravascular volume. Catheter ablation can lead to further injury to the atrial myocardium, as evidenced by post-procedural troponin release and tissue oedema. The cardiomyocyte loss leads to replacement fibrosis, which may affect up to 30-35% of the LA wall. These alterations further impair atrial force generation and neurohormonal functions; the additional loss of atrial distensibility can lead to a ‘stiff LA syndrome’, and the fibrotic response predisposes to recurrence of the atrial arrhythmia. Although it intends to restore LA systole, catheter ablation often decreases the chamber’s transport functions. This is particularly likely in patients with long-standing atrial fibrillation and pre-existing LA fibrosis, especially those with increased epicardial adipose tissue (e.g. patients with obesity, diabetes and/or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction). Although the fibrotic LA in these individuals is an ideal substrate for the development of atrial fibrillation, it may be a suboptimal substrate for catheter ablation. Such patients are not likely to experience long-term restoration of sinus rhythm, and catheter ablation has the potential to worsen their haemodynamic and clinical status. Further studies in this vulnerable group of patients are needed.</p>

<p>Native human subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) is well organized into unilocular adipocytes interspersed within dense vascularization. This structure is completely lost under standard culture conditions and may impair the comparison with native tissue. Here, we developed a 3-D model of human white AT reminiscent of the cellular architecture found in vivo. Starting with adipose progenitors derived from the stromal-vascular fraction of human subcutaneous white AT, we generated spheroids in which endogenous endothelial cells self-assembled to form highly organized endothelial networks among stromal cells. Using an optimized adipogenic differentiation medium to preserve endothelial cells, we obtained densely vascularized spheroids containing mature adipocytes with unilocular lipid vacuoles. In vivo study showed that when differentiated spheroids were transplanted in immune-deficient mice, endothelial cells within the spheroids connected to the recipient circulatory system, forming chimeric vessels. In addition, adipocytes of human origin were still observed in transplanted mice. We therefore have developed an in vitro model of vascularized human AT-like organoids that constitute an excellent tool and model for any study of human AT.</p>

<p>Statins may precipitate the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk patients. In contrast, only the subset of individuals with insulin resistance and/or diabetes receives cardiovascular benefits with fibrates. In this context, previous observations from our laboratory suggested that atorvastatin induced an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), whereas fenofibrate had the opposite effects in rabbits. Therefore, we determined the mass, morphology, and vascularization of VAT in New Zealand white rabbits (n = 6/group) that received 0.33 or 2.6 mg/kg/d of atorvastatin or fenofibrate, respectively, during 2 months. As expected, the cholesterol from the atorvastatin group was lower after treatment, while triglycerides decreased in the fenofibrate group. The mass of VAT from the fenofibrate group was 46% lower compared to the controls, meanwhile atorvastatin was associated with a larger diameter of adipocytes (+65%) than that of the control and fenofibrate groups. Fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2) gene expression was lower in the fenofibrate group than in the control group (-54%). By contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) gene expression in fenofibrate-treated rabbits was 110% higher than in the control group. In agreement with the gene expression, the marker of angiogenesis platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 was slightly but significantly higher (+10%) in rabbits treated with fenofibrate than in controls, as determined by immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that fenofibrate is associated with a favorable remodeling of VAT, that is, reduced mass and increased vascularization in normolipemic rabbits; in contrast, atorvastatin induced a nonfavorable remodeling of VAT. These results may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of fenofibrate and the increased risk of T2D in high-risk patients induced by atorvastatin.</p>

<p>Lameness and body condition are closely related. Recent studies have shown that cows with low body condition score (BCS) have a greater risk for developing lameness than cows with higher BCS. Among other reasons, this relationship might be related to the reduced thickness of the digital fat cushion in lean cows. The digital cushion is not a homogeneous structure but consists of different fat pads and connective tissue. We hypothesized that either high or low BCS will result in concordant adipocyte sizes in the fat pads of the digital cushion and subcutaneous tailhead fat irrespective of the localization of the latter. Right front claws were collected from 18 Holstein Friesian cows. Cows were selected according to their BCS: 9 cows with BCS &lt;3 (low BCS) and 9 cows with BCS =3 (high BCS). After dissecting the horn capsule of the lateral claw, samples of the axial and abaxial fat pads were prepared for histomorphological examinations (adipocyte size measurement) and protein abundance of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) via Western blotting. In addition, fat samples were excised from the tailhead of all cows and used for the same purposes. Adipocyte size in tailhead fat was greater in high-BCS than in low-BCS cows. Similar differences between the BCS groups were apparent for adipocytes from the axial fat pad, although adipocytes in tailhead fat were larger than those in the digital cushion. In contrast to that in the axial fat pad and tailhead fat, adipocyte size in the abaxial fat pad was similar in cows from both BCS groups. A relationship between adipocyte size and VEGF-A protein was only confirmed for the axial fat pad, not for the other fat depots. When comparing BCS groups, differences in VEGF-A protein abundance between high-BCS and low-BCS cows were also limited to the axial fat pad, being absent in tailhead fat and the abaxial fat pad. Taken together, our results show that the fat pads from the digital cushion should not be considered uniform adipose tissue locations but rather discrete units reacting differently to fat mobilization.</p>

<p>Obesity is well-known as the second factor for tumorigenesis after smoking and is bound up with the malignant progression of several kinds of cancers, including esophageal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, and ovarian cancer. The increased morbidity and mortality of obesity-related cancer are mostly attributed to dysfunctional adipose tissue. The possible mechanisms connecting dysfunctional adipose tissue to high cancer risk mainly focus on chronic inflammation, obesity-related microenvironment, adipokine secretion disorder, and browning of adipose tissue, and so forth. The stromal vascular cells in adipose tissue trigger chronic inflammation through secreting inflammatory factors and promote cancer cell proliferation. Hypertrophic adipose tissues lead to metabolic disorders of adipocytes, such as abnormal levels of adipokines that mediate cancer progression and metastasis. Cancer patients often show adipose tissue browning and cancerous cachexia in an advanced stage, which lead to unsatisfied chemotherapy effect and poor prognosis. However, increasing evidence has shown that adipose tissue may display quite opposite effects in cancer development. Therefore, the interaction between cancers and adipose tissue exert a vital role in mediates adipose tissue dysfunction and further leads to cancer progression. In conclusion, targeting the dysfunction of adipose tissue provides a promising strategy for cancer prevention and therapy.</p>

<p>Resveratrol increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells by upregulating the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), stimulating eNOS enzymatic activity, and preventing eNOS uncoupling. At the same time, resveratrol inhibits the synthesis of endothelin-1 and reduces oxidative stress in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Pathological stimuli-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, and arterial stiffness can be ameliorated by resveratrol as well. In addition, resveratrol also modulates immune cell function, inhibition of immune cell infiltration into the vascular wall, and improves the function of perivascular adipose tissue. All these mechanisms contribute to the protective effects of resveratrol on vascular function and blood pressure in vivo. Sirtuin 1, AMP-activated protein kinase, and estrogen receptors represent the major molecules mediating the vascular effects of resveratrol.</p>

<p>Obesity is an important preventable risk factor for morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic disease. Oxidative stress (including in visceral adipose tissue) and chronic low-grade inflammation are the major underlying pathomechanisms. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) has recently emerged as an important source of cardiovascular oxidative stress. The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of MAO as contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in white adipose tissue and vessels harvested from patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. To this aim, visceral adipose tissue and mesenteric artery branches were isolated from obese patients with chronic inflammation and used for organ bath, ROS production, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistology studies. The human visceral adipose tissue and mesenteric artery branches contain mainly the MAO-A isoform, as shown by the quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistology experiments. A significant upregulation of MAO-A, the impairment in vascular reactivity, and increase in ROS production were found in obese vs. non-obese patients. Incubation of the adipose tissue samples and vascular rings with the MAO-A inhibitor (clorgyline, 30 min) improved vascular reactivity and decreased ROS generation. In conclusion, MAO-A is the predominant isoform in human abdominal adipose and vascular tissues, is overexpressed in the setting of inflammation, and contributes to the endothelial dysfunction.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The metabolic syndrome is a pathological state in which one of the key components is insulin resistance. A wide spectrum of body compartments is involved in its pathophysiology. Genetic and environmental factors such as diet and physical activity are both related to its etiology. Reversible modulation of gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, known as epigenetic modifications, has been shown to drive this complex metabolic cluster of conditions. Here, we aim to examine some of the recent research of specific epigenetically mediated mechanisms and microbiota-induced epigenetic modifications on the development of adipose tissue and obesity, ß-cell dysfunction and diabetes, and hepatocytes and non-alcoholic fatty disease.RECENT FINDINGS: DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications have been identified in this context; the integrated analysis of genome, epigenome, and transcriptome is likely to expand our knowledge of epigenetics in health and disease. Epigenetic modifications induced by diet-related microbiota or metabolites possibly contribute to the insulin-resistant state. The identification of epigenetic signatures on diabetes and obesity may give us the possibility of developing new interventions, prevention measures, and follow-up strategies.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue, as the main energy storage organ and through its endocrine activity, is interconnected with all physiological functions. It plays a fundamental role in energy homeostasis and in the development of metabolic disorders. Up to now, this tissue has been analysed as a pool of different cell types with very little attention paid to the organization and putative partitioning of cells. Considering the absence of a complete picture of the intimate architecture of this large soft tissue, we developed a method that combines tissue clearing, acquisition of autofluorescence or lectin signals by confocal microscopy, segmentation procedures based on contrast enhancement, and a new semi-automatic image analysis process, allowing accurate and quantitative characterization of the whole 3D fat pad organization. This approach revealed the unexpected anatomic complexity of the murine subcutaneous fat pad. Although the classical picture of adipose tissue corresponds to a superposition of simple and small ellipsoidal lobules of adipose cells separated by mesenchymal spans, our results show that segmented lobules display complex 3D poly-lobular shapes. Despite differences in shape and size, the number of these poly-lobular subunits is similar from one fat pad to another. Finally, investigation of the relationships of these subunits between each other revealed a never-described organization in two clusters with distinct molecular signatures and specific vascular and sympathetic nerve densities correlating with different browning abilities. This innovative procedure reveals that subcutaneous adipose tissue exhibits a subtle functional heterogeneity with partitioned areas, and opens new perspectives towards understanding its functioning and plasticity.</p>

<p>This Special Topics Issue of the journal “Microcirculation” presents seven manuscripts spanning multiple perspectives of investigation. The first two manuscripts present technical/analytical approaches to determining and quantifying vascular network structure, and the third presents a methodology for determining intravascular hemodynamics within the in situ microvascular network. The fourth manuscript utilizes complexity analyses to determine changes in microvascular perfusion as a predictor of disease severity, while the fifth study links the changes to perfusion complexity to tissue metabolic demand and potential limitations on mitochondrial metabolism within skeletal muscle. The sixth manuscript further addresses this critical topic, providing a state-of-the-art discussion of skeletal muscle oxygen kinetics and the factors that impact this vital process. The final manuscript outlines the impact of the deletion of Robo4 on the vascular endothelium on microvascular function in white adipose tissue and the potentially beneficial effects for anti-obesity treatment. We hope that this presentation of issues of “Complexity in the Microcirculation” will be beneficial to the reader.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) can differentiate into beige adipose tissue by the browning process. Some polyphenols, including isoflavones, particularly genistein, are suggested to increase the expression of browning markers. There is evidence that consumption of genistein can attenuate body weight gain and improve glucose tolerance and blood lipid levels. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential mechanisms of stimulation by which genistein activates the browning of WAT. We studied the stimulation of the expression of browning markers in the following models: mice fed genistein; preadipocytes from 3 T3-L1 cells; and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from the inguinal adipose tissue of mice. The results indicated that genistein can stimulate the browning process by at least two mechanisms. An indirect mechanism was involved in the induction of PGC-1a/FNDC5 in skeletal muscle leading to an increase in the myokine irisin. In preadipocytes, irisin was able to increase the expression of Ucp1 and Tmem26, markers of browning, to increase energy expenditure. Interestingly, genistein was also able to activate browning by a direct mechanism. Incubation of preadipocytes with genistein increased UCP1 expression as well as some biomarkers of browning in a concentration-dependent manner, possibly via phosphorylation of AMPK. The effect of genistein was accompanied by an increase in the number of mitochondria as well as in the maximum respiration rate of the adipocytes. In conclusion, this study indicated that genistein can increase energy expenditure by stimulating the browning process directly in preadipocytes and indirectly by increasing the circulating levels of irisin.</p>

<p>Bone tissue engineering is an area of regenerative medicine that attempts to repair bone defects. Seed cells such as dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are two of the most well-characterized cells for bone regeneration because their use involves few ethical constraints and they have the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, secreting growth factors and depositing mineral. However, bone regeneration ability of these cells remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the bone formation capacity of DPSCs and ADSCs in vitro and in vivo. Studies revealed that DPSCs had enhanced colony-forming ability, higher proliferative ability, stronger migration ability and higher expression of angiogenesis-related genes. They also secreted more vascular endothelial growth factor compared to ADSCs. In contrast, ADSCs grew more slowly compared to DPSCs but exhibited greater osteogenic differentiation potential, higher expression of osteoblast marker genes, and greater mineral deposition. Furthermore, after DPSCs and ADSCs were implanted into a mandibular defect of a rat for 6<U+2009>weeks, ADSCs showed visible bone tissue as early as week 1 and promoted faster and greater bone regeneration compared to the DPSC group. These results suggest that ADSCs might be more useful than DPSCs for bone regeneration.</p>

<p>Exercise mitigates chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity; however, the molecular mechanisms governing protection from these diseases are not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that exercise rescues metabolically compromised high fat diet (HFD) fed mice, and reprograms subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). Using transcriptomic profiling, scWAT was analyzed for HFD gene expression changes that were rescued by exercise. Gene networks involved in vascularization were identified as prominent targets of exercise, which led us to investigate the vasculature architecture and endothelial phenotype. Vascular density in scWAT was found to be compromised in HFD, and exercise rescued this defect. Similarly, angiogenic capacity as measured by ex vivo capillary sprouting was significantly promoted with exercise. Together, these data demonstrate that exercise enhances scWAT vascularization and functional capacity for angiogenesis, and can prevent the detrimental effects of HFD. The improvement in these indices correlates with improvement of whole-body metabolism, suggesting that scWAT vascularization may be a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disease.</p>

<p>Leptin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue, has been linked to many regulatory pathways. Its role in the complex relationship between obesity and CVD is not yet clear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether leptin interferes directly with cardiac function regulation, altering its contractile force character, and hence contributing to different pathological processes. Muscle samples were obtained from human atrial myocardium. Each trial included two samples from the same patient. They were simultaneously electrically stimulated under sustained perfusion to perform isometric contractions. One sample was treated with a high concentration of human recombinant leptin (1 µg/ml). The other was treated with placebo and served as a control. The exhibited contraction forces (CF) and the contraction duration (CD) after 20 min of treatment were normalised by dividing them by the values before the treatment and reported as a percentage. A total of ten successful trials were conducted. Exposure to leptin did not yield a statistically significant variation in both CF and CF. In the treatment group, CF% measured 108 (95 % CI 91, 125) % and CD% measured 95 (95 % CI 90, 101) % after 20 min. In the control group, CF% measured 105 (90 % CI 84, 126) % and CD% measured 92 (95 % CI 80, 105) % after 20 min. We concluded that leptin does not alter the contractile character of human atrial tissues, even in supraphysiological dosage. These results suggest that leptin does not play a role in short-term cardiac regulation.</p>

<p>Based on the obesity paradox, people with a normal body mass index (BMI) may have a higher risk of mortality than those with a BMI that falls within the obese range. Despite the availability of other anthropometric measures, obesity is commonly evaluated based on BMI. A body shape index (ABSI) and body roundness index (BRI) have recently been proposed as new anthropometric measures that are calculated with height, weight, and waist circumference. This study investigated the associations between the traditional and new body composition indices and arterial stiffness using the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). Overall, 3512 individuals (1228 men and 2284 women) were enrolled and were divided into two groups according to BMI. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between baPWV and body composition. baPWV was significantly associated with ABSI (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.087, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002), visceral adipose tissue (VAT; ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.081, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002), and the visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) ratio (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.108, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) in non-obese men. In non-obese women, baPWV was significantly associated with several variables but not the VAT/SAT ratio. Similarly, baPWV was significantly associated with BMI (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.103, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.038), BRI (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.104, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.036), VAT (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.167, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001), and the VAT/SAT ratio (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.106, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.028) in obese women. ABSI can be used with high accuracy to evaluate fat distribution in non-obese men to predict arterial stiffness. However, the BRI should be used in addition to BMI to assess the body composition of women more accurately. ABSI and the BRI can be used to identify predictors of vascular remodeling or organic vascular dysfunction.</p>

<p>Objective- Insulin resistance and inflammation in pregnancy are risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus. Increased plasma HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and apo (apolipoprotein) A-I levels have been reported to improve glucose metabolism and inhibit inflammation in animals and humans. This study asks whether increasing plasma apoA-I levels improves insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation in insulin-resistant pregnant rats. Approach and Results- Insulin-resistant pregnant rats received intravenous infusions of lipid-free apoA-I (8 mg/kg) or saline on days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 of pregnancy. The rats were then subjected to a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Glucose uptake was increased in white and brown adipose tissue by 57±13% and 32±10%, respectively ( P&lt;0.05 for both), and in quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscle by 35±9.7% and 47±14%, respectively ( P&lt;0.05 for both), in the apoA-I-treated pregnant rats relative to saline-infused pregnant rats. The pregnant rats that were treated with apoA-I also had reduced plasma TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor-a) levels by 57±8.4%, plasma IL (interleukin)-6 levels by 67±9.5%, and adipose tissue macrophage content by 54±8.2% ( P&lt;0.05 for all) relative to the saline-treated pregnant rats. Conclusions- These studies establish that apoA-I protects against pregnancy-induced insulin resistance in rats by increasing insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and inhibiting inflammation. This identifies apoA-I as a potential target for preventing pregnancy-induced insulin resistance and reducing the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus.</p>

<p>Adult stem cell-based therapy has been regarded as a promising treatment for tissue ischemia because of its ability to promote new blood vessel formation. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are the most used angiogenic cells for therapeutic neovascularization, yet the side effects and low efficacy have limited their clinical application. Adipose stromal vascular fraction is an easily accessible, heterogeneous cell system comprised of endothelial, stromal, and hematopoietic cell lineages, which has been shown to spontaneously form robust, patent, and functional vasculatures in vivo. However, the characteristics of each cell population and their specific roles in neovascularization remain an area of ongoing investigation. In this review, we summarize the functional capabilities of various stromal vascular fraction constituents during the process of neovascularization and attempt to analyze whether the cross-talk between these constituents generates a synergetic effect, thus contributing to the development of new potential therapeutic strategies to promote neovascularization.</p>

<p>Adipose stem cells (ASCs) are the basis of procedures intended for tissue regeneration. These cells are heterogeneous, owing to various factors, including the donor age, sex, body mass index, and clinical condition; the isolation procedure (liposuction or fat excision); the place from where the cells were sampled (body site and depth of each adipose depot); culture surface; type of medium (whether supplemented with fetal bovine serum or xeno-free), that affect the principal phenotypic features of ASCs. The features related to ASCs heterogeneity are relevant for the success of therapeutic procedures; these features include proliferation capacity, differentiation potential, immunophenotype, and the secretome. These are important characteristics for the success of regenerative tissue engineering, not only because of their effects upon the reconstruction and healing exerted by ASCs themselves, but also because of the paracrine signaling of ASCs and its impact on recipient tissues. Knowledge of sources of heterogeneity will be helpful in the standardization of ASCs-based procedures. New avenues of research could include evaluation of the effects of the use of more homo1geneous ASCs for specific purposes, the study of ASCs-recipient interactions in heterologous cell transplantation, and the characterization of epigenetic changes in ASCs, as well as investigations of the effect of the metabolome upon ASCs behavior in culture.</p>

<p>This study was designed to determine the influence of microvesicles (MVs) derived from multipotent stromal cells isolated from human adipose tissue (hASCs) on retinal functionality in dogs with various types of retinal degeneration. The biological properties of hASC-MVs were first determined using an in vitro model of retinal Muller-like cells (CaMLCs). The in vitro assays included analysis of hASC-MVs influence on cell viability and metabolism. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was also determined. Evaluation of the hASC-MVs was performed under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Preliminary clinical studies were performed on ten dogs with retinal degeneration. The clinical studies included behavioral tests, fundoscopy and electroretinography before and after hASC-MVs intra-vitreal injection. The in vitro study showed that CaMLCs treated with hASC-MVs were characterized by improved viability and mitochondrial potential, both under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Additionally, hASC-MVs under oxidative stress conditions reduced the number of senescence-associated markers, correlating with the increased expression of BDNF. The preliminary clinical study showed that the intra-vitreal administration of hASC-MVs significantly improved the dogs’ general behavior and tracking ability. Furthermore, fundoscopy demonstrated that the retinal blood vessels appeared to be less attenuated, and electroretinography using HMsERG demonstrated an increase in a- and b-wave amplitude after treatment. These results shed promising light on the application of cell-free therapies in veterinary medicine for retinal degenerative disorders treatment.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether brown adipose tissue (BAT) or skeletal muscle activity mediates the relationship between personal level of environmental temperature (Personal-ET) and wrist skin temperature (WT). Moreover, we examined whether BAT and skeletal muscle have a mediating role between Personal-ET and WT (as a proxy of peripheral vasoconstriction/vasodilation).RESULTS: The study found that BAT volume and metabolic activity played a positive and significant role (up to 25.4%) in the association between Personal-ET and WT. In addition, at the coldest temperatures, the participants with lower levels of WT (inducing higher peripheral vasoconstriction) had higher levels of BAT outcomes, whereas in warm temperatures, participants with higher levels of WT (inducing higher peripheral vasodilation) had lower levels of BAT outcomes. The study did not find any mediating role of skeletal muscle activity.CONCLUSIONS: BAT volume and metabolic activity play a role in the relationship between Personal-ET and WT. Moreover, the data suggest that there are two distinct phenotypes: individuals who respond better to the cold, both through nonshivering thermogenesis and peripheral vasoconstriction, and individuals who respond better to the heat.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The susceptibility to abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome is determined to a substantial extent during childhood and adolescence, when key adipose tissue characteristics are established. Although the general impact of postnatal nutrition is well known, it is not clear how specific dietary components drive adipose tissue growth and how this relates to the risk of metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.METHODS: Adipose tissue growth including cell proliferation was analyzed in juvenile mice upon dietary manipulation with in vivo nucleotide labeling. The proliferative response of progenitors to specific fatty acids was assayed in primary cultures. Long-term metabolic consequences were assessed through transient dietary manipulation post-weaning with a second obesogenic challenge in adulthood.RESULTS: Dietary lipids stimulated adipose tissue progenitor cell proliferation in juvenile mice independently of excess caloric intake and calorie-dependent adipocyte hypertrophy. Excess calories increased mitogenic IGF-1 levels systemically, whereas palmitoleic acid was able to enhance the sensitivity of progenitors to IGF-1, resulting in synergistic stimulation of proliferation. Early transient consumption of excess lipids promoted hyperplastic adipose tissue expansion in response to a second dietary challenge in adulthood and this correlated with abdominal obesity and hyperinsulinemia.CONCLUSIONS: Dietary lipids and calories differentially and synergistically drive adipose tissue proliferative growth and the programming of the metabolic syndrome in childhood.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue plays a role in energy storage and metabolic balance and is composed of different cell types. The metabolic activity of the tissue itself has been a matter of research for a long time, but comparative data about the energy metabolism of different cell types of human subcutaneous adipose tissue are sparse. Therefore, we compared the activity of major energy metabolic pathways of adipocytes and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) separated from the same tissue. This CD34<sup>+</sup> cell fraction is enriched with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitors, as they account for the largest proportion of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells of the SVF. Adipocytes displayed significantly higher mitochondrial enzyme capacities compared to CD34<sup>+</sup> SVF-cells, as shown by the higher activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase and ß-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Inversely, the CD34<sup>+</sup> SVF-cells showed higher capacities for cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism, represented by the activity of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, the CD34<sup>+</sup> SVF-cells may ensure the provision of pentose phosphates and reduction equivalents for the replication of DNA during proliferation. The data indicate that these two cell fractions of the human adipose tissue vary in their metabolic configuration adapted to their physiological demands regarding proliferation and differentiation in vivo.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue and its derivatives, including adipose-derived stem cells, stromal vascular fraction (SVF), and SVF-gel, have been used in the treatment of many ischemic disorders. However, the use of these products is limited in clinical applications by concerns related to the presence of cells in these derivatives.OBJECTIVES: This study aims to isolate a cell-free fat extract (FE) from fat tissue and to evaluate its proangiogenic ability in vitro as well as its protective effects on skin flap survival in vivo.METHODS: FE was isolated from human fat via a mechanical approach. The concentrations of several growth factors in the FE were determined by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). The proangiogenic ability of FE was evaluated using assays of the proliferation, migration, and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. The protective effects of FE on the survival of random pattern skin flaps were investigated by subcutaneous injection into rats.RESULTS: ELISA results revealed that FE contained proangiogenic growth factors that promoted proliferation, migration, and tube formation in HUVECs in vitro. In addition, FE reduced skin flaps necrosis and increased their survival, as demonstrated by macroscopic measurements and blood flow analysis. Histological analysis revealed that FE treatment increased the capillary density.CONCLUSIONS: FE is a cell-free, easy-to-prepare, and growth-factor-enriched liquid derived from human adipose tissue that possesses proangiogenic activity and improves skin flap survival by accelerating blood vessel formation. FE may be potentially used for treating ischemic disorders.</p>

<p>Adipose derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a method of cell therapy potentially applicable for treatment of full thickness burns. Here we investigated if the association of photobiomodulation (PBM) with SVF therapy could improve wound healing in experimentally induced full thickness burn wounds in rats compared to the topical agent 2% silver sulfadiazine in a dose-dependent manner. Sixty-six male Wistar rats were divided in 4 groups containing 5 animals each which received the following treatments: 2% sulfadiazine (SD), SVF, SVF plus PBM at 30<U+202F>mW (SVFL30), and SVF plus PBM at 100<U+202F>mW (SVFL100). Two donor animals were used for each experimental series with 3, 7 and 30<U+202F>days. Digital photography, microscopic analysis with Hematoxilin and Eosin (H&amp;E), quantification of collagen type I by picrosirius red staining analysis and wound contraction evaluation were performed in order to quantify the results. At day 3 SVF alone or combined with PBM promoted increased early inflammatory response compared to SD. At day 7 SVFL30 and SVFL100 enhanced inflammatory cells infiltration, angiogenesis and fibroblast content compared to SVF and SD groups. At day 30 collagen concentration and wound contraction were higher in SVFL30 when compared to the other groups. In conclusion PBM promotes a synergistic outcome with SVF therapy with a dose dependent effect potentializing wound healing of experimental full thickness burns in rats through amplification of early inflammatory response, enhanced angiogenesis, fibroblast content, accentuated wound contraction and collagen concentration.</p>

<p>Adiponectin (APN), released mainly from adipose tissue, is a well-known homeostatic factor for regulating glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. A recent study showed that human hair follicles express APN receptors and the presence of APN-mediated hair growth signaling, thereby suggesting that APN is a potent hair growth-promoting adipokine. Previously, kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives (KCEDs) were synthesized in our institute as new anti-aging or adiponectin-/adipogenesis-inducing compounds. Here, we tested the activity of these derivatives to induce endogenous APN secretion. Among the derivatives, KCED-1 and KCED-2 showed improved activity in inducing APN mRNA expression, secretion of APN protein, and adipogenesis in human subcutaneous fat cells (hSCFs) when compared with the effects of Seletinoid G, a verified APN inducer. When human follicular dermal papilla cells were treated with the culture supernatant of KCED-1- or KCED-2-treated hSCFs, the mRNA expression of APN-induced hair growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor was upregulated compared with that in the control. Taken together, our study shows that among kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives, KCED-1, KCED-2, as well as Seletinoid G are effective inducers of endogenous APN production in subcutaneous fat tissues, which may in turn contribute to the promotion of hair growth in the human scalp.</p>

<p>Rudmann, Colleton</p>
<p>The choroid plexus (CP) produces cerebrospinal fluid and has epithelial, interstitial, and vascular compartments. The CP is a potential site of toxicity, and recognizing the normal microanatomy in different animal models is important for the pathologist. In preclinical studies with beagle dog and New Zealand white rabbits, we observed variable numbers of adipocytes in the CP interstitium of control and xenobiotic-treated animals. The adipocytes were unilocular and consistent morphologically with white adipose tissue. There was a striking variability in the number of adipocytes; however, the presence of adipocytes was not associated with other microscopic findings that would suggest a pathologic process. The morphology of adipocytes was reminiscent of what is observed normally in the interstitium of other tissues like skeletal muscle, bone marrow, and the subcutis. Therefore, we propose that the interstitial adipocytes not be recorded as a finding in preclinical studies unless the adipocytes are altered spontaneously (ie, lipoma) or after xenobiotic treatment.</p>

<p>In this study, the potential of vascularized tissue-engineered bone constructed by a double cell-sheet (DCS) complex and polylysine (PLL)-modified coralline hydroxyapatite (CHA) to repair large radius bone defects was investigated in rabbits. Firstly, the DCS complex was obtained after rabbit adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) culture was induced. Secondly, PLL-CHA composite scaffolds with different concentrations of PLL were prepared by the soaking and vacuum freeze-drying methods, and then the scaffolds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, compression performance testing and cytocompatibility evaluation. Thirdly, DCS-PLL-CHA vascularized tissue-engineered bone was constructed in vitro and transplanted into a large radius bone defect model in rabbits. Finally, the potential of the DCS-PLL-CHA vascularized tissue-engineered bone to repair the large bone defect was evaluated through general observations, laser speckle imaging, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histological staining, radiography observations and RT-PCR. The in vitro experimental results showed that the DCS complex provided a very large cell reserve, which carried a large number of osteoblasts and vascular endothelial cells that were induced in vitro. When the DCS complex was combined with the PLL-CHA scaffold in vitro, the effects of PLL on cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation led to a situation similar to the chemotaxis of the body, making the combined complex more conducive to graft cellularization than the DCS complex alone. The in vivo experiments showed blood supply on the surface of the callus in each group, and the amount of blood perfusion on the surface of the defect area was almost equal among the groups. At 12<U+202F>weeks, the surface of the DCS-PLL-CHA group was completely wrapped by bone tissue and osteoids, the cortical bone image was basically continuous, and the medullary cavity was mainly perforated. A large amount of well-arranged lamellar bone was formed, a small amount of undegraded CHA exhibited a linear pattern, and a large amount of bone filling could be seen in the pores. At 12<U+202F>weeks, the expression levels of BGLAP, SPP1 and VEGF were similar in each group, but PECAM1 expression was higher in the DCS-PLL-CHA group than in the autogenous bone group and CHA group. The results showed that PLL could effectively promote the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of ADSCs and that DCS-PLL-CHA vascularized tissue-engineered bone has potential for bone regeneration and bone reconstruction and can be used to repair large bone defects. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 1. PLL-CHA composite scaffolds with different concentrations of PLL were prepared by the soaking and vacuum freeze-drying methods. 2. The vascularized tissue-engineered bone was constructed by the double cell sheet (DCS) complex combined with PLL-CHA scaffolds. 3. The DCS-PLL-CHA vascularized tissue-engineered bone has potential for bone regeneration and bone reconstruction and can be used to repair large bone defects.</p>

<p>n-3 PUFA may exert favourable effects on several processes that may inhibit the atherosclerotic process. However, the role of n-3 PUFA in lowering the risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) has been fiercely debated. In the present paper, we summarise the main findings from previous follow-up studies of intake and studies using adipose tissue as an objective biomarker to investigate exposure to n-3 PUFA in relation to ASCVD risk and discuss some perspectives for further research. The majority of previous studies investigating intake of marine- and plant-based n-3 PUFA have focused on CHD while other ASCVD such as ischaemic stroke and peripheral artery disease have been less studied. However, recent data from Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort suggest that marine n-3 PUFA may be inversely associated with risk of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease caused by atherosclerosis. The effect of the plant-derived n-3 PUFA a-linolenic acid on ASCVD is less clear and several gaps in the literature remain to be explored.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cellular therapeutic agents may benefit trauma patients by modulating the immune response to injury, and by reducing inflammation and vascular leakage. Administration of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) shows some benefit in preclinical and clinical trials, but less testing has been performed with other cell types. Human primary fibroblasts (FBs) were compared to MSCs in assays designed to evaluate MSCs to determine if these assays actually evaluate properties unique to MSCs or whether related cell types perform similarly.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MSC-related surface marker expression, tissue factor, and human leukocyte antigen-D related were evaluated by flow cytometry, and in vitro adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential were determined. Procoagulant activity was determined by thromboelastography. Two potency assays correlated with immunomodulation potential were utilized: the mixed lymphocyte reaction and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme activity assays.RESULTS: Human primary FBs performed similarly to MSCs in assays designed to evaluate MSC characteristics and potency. Although similar for MSC-positive cell surface marker expression, FBs did not show robust adipose differentiation and expressed some level of markers not expected on MSCs.CONCLUSIONS: Human primary FBs are very similar to human MSCs, at least in assays currently used to evaluate MSC potency. Preclinical and clinical testing are required to determine if FBs show similar activity to MSCs in vivo. If FBs show inferior activity in vivo, development of new MSC-specific potency assays will be necessary to evaluate properties relevant to their unique clinical benefits.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Higher perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes to adverse physiologic alterations in the vascular wall, and thus could potentially limit normal physical function later in life. We hypothesize that higher PVAT volume at midlife is prospectively associated with slower gait speed later in life, independent of overall adiposity and other risk factors.METHODS: Participants from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) cardiovascular fat ancillary study were included. PVAT volume around the descending aorta was quantified using existing CT scans at midlife, while gait speed was measured after an average of 10.4 ± 0.7 years.RESULTS: 276 women (age 51.3±2.8 years at PVAT assessment) were included. Mean gait speed was 0.96 ± 0.21 m/s. Adjusting for study-site, race, education-level, menopausal status, and length of descending aorta at PVAT assessment, and age, body mass index, difficulty paying for basics, overall health and smoking status at gait speed assessment, a higher midlife PVAT volume was associated with a slower gait speed later in life (P=0.03). With further adjustment for presence of any comorbid conditions by the time of gait speed assessment, the association persisted; every 1-SD increase in log-PVAT was associated with 3.3% slower gait speed (95% CI: 0.3%-6.3%; P=0.03).CONCLUSION: Greater PVAT in midlife women may contribute to poorer physical function in older age supporting a potential role of midlife PVAT in multiple domains of healthy aging. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the physiologic changes associated with PVAT that may underlie the observed associations.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a heterogeneous population of cells that yields a homogeneous population of plastic-adherent adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASC) when culture-expanded. SVF and ASC have been used clinically to improve tendon healing, yet their mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential for ASC to act as trophic mediators for tendon healing. Flexor digitorum superficialis tendons and adipose tissue were harvested from adult horses to obtain SVF, ASC, and tenocytes. Growth factor gene expression was quantified in SVF and ASC in serial passages and growth factors were quantified in ASC-conditioned medium (CM). Microchemotaxis assays were performed using ASC-CM. Tenocytes were grown in co-culture with autologous ASC or allogeneic SVF. Gene expression for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a), transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1) and TGF-ß3 was significantly higher in SVF compared to ASC. Concentrations were significantly increased in ASC-CM compared to controls for IGF-1 (4-fold) and SDF-1a (6-fold). Medium conditioned by ASC induced significant cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression for collagen types I and III, decorin, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein was modestly, but significantly increased following co-culture of tenocytes with autologous ASC. Our findings support the ability of SVF and ASC to act as trophic mediators in tendon healing, particularly through chemotaxis, which stands to critically impact the intrinsic healing response. In vivo studies to further delineate the potential for SVF and/or ASC to improve tendon healing are warranted. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<p>Most of the systemic blood vessels are surrounded by the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Healthy PVAT is anticontractile and anti-inflammatory, but a dysfunctional PVAT has been suggested to link cardiometabolic risk factors to vascular dysfunction. Vascular oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological event in cardiometabolic complications of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. PVAT-derived adipocytes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide that might signal to vascular wall. Therefore, an abnormal generation of ROS by PVAT emerges as a potential pathophysiological mechanism underlying vascular injury. This review summarizes new findings describing ROS production in PVAT of several vascular beds, major sources of ROS in this tissue including mitochondria, NADPH oxidase and eNOS uncoupled, and finally, changes in ROS production affecting vascular function in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Adiponectin is a cytokine secreted from adipose tissue that regulates energy homeostasis, inflammation, and cell proliferation. Obesity is associated with increased risk of various cancers, including ovarian cancer. Adipokines, including adiponectin, have been implicated as a factor linking obesity and carcinogenesis. The oncogenic role of adiponectin is not known with regard to various cancer types. We sought to determine the role of adiponectin in angiogenesis in ovarian cancer in vitro.METHODS: We transfected SKOV3 cells with vascular endothelial growth factor small interfering RNA in order to identify the independent angiogenic role of adiponectin in ovarian cancer. The vascular endothelial growth factor knockdown SKOV3 cell lines were treated with adiponectin for 48<U+2009>h. The cytokines involved in adiponectin-mediated angiogenesis were explored using the human angiogenesis cytokine array and were verified with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The angiogenic effect of adiponectin was evaluated using the human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay. We also investigated the effects of adiponectin treatment on the migration and invasion of SKOV3 cells.RESULTS: The number of tubes formed by human umbilical vein endothelial cell decreased significantly after knockdown of vascular endothelial growth factor (via transfection of vascular endothelial growth factor small interfering RNA into SKOV3 cells). When these vascular endothelial growth factor knockdown SKOV3 cells were treated with adiponectin, there was an increase in the number of tubes in a tube formation assay. Following adiponectin treatment, the CXC chemokine ligand 1 secretion increased in a cytokine array. This was confirmed by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The increased secretion of CXC chemokine ligand 1 by adiponectin occurred regardless of vascular endothelial growth factor knockdown. In addition, the induction of migration and invasion of SKOV3 cells were significantly stronger with adiponectin treatment than they were without.CONCLUSION: Adiponectin treatment of ovarian cancer cells induces angiogenesis via CXC chemokine ligand 1 independently of vascular endothelial growth factor. These findings suggest that adiponectin may serve as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSCs) exhibited high potential in tissue repair and regeneration, and it has been proved that ADSCs could protect brain cells from apoptosis and maintaining blood-brain barrier stability after cerebral vascular disease. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential and mechanism of ADSCs stereotactic transplantation in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mice model and hemin-treated astrocytes. Mice were divided into three groups: sham group, ICH<U+2009>+<U+2009>PBS group, and ICH<U+2009>+<U+2009>ADSC group. Mice in ICH<U+2009>+<U+2009>ADSC group received ADSCs cell suspension stereotactic transplantation into the area beside the bleeding region. Astrocytes were divided into three groups: control group, hemin group, and hemin<U+2009>+<U+2009>ADSC group. Astrocytes in hemin<U+2009>+<U+2009>ADSC group were cultured in ADSCs-astrocyte no-contact coculture system and treated with 30<U+2009>µM hemin solution. The results showed that ADSCs stereotactic transplantation improved functional outcomes and reduced cell apoptosis after ICH. Moreover, ADSCs stereotactic transplantation could alleviate brain edema and inflammation and AQP4 protein expression contributed to the alleviation of brain edema. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including p38/MAPK pathway and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, were involved in AQP4 modulation by ADSCs transplantation in ICH. In conclusion, ADSCs transplantation could alleviate the nervous tissue injury, reduce cell apoptosis, and relieve brain edema in ICH. And the edema regulation effect of ADSCs transplantation is associated with inhibition of inflammation and AQP4 protein expression.</p>

<p>Over the past few decades, there has been growing interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis and progression, as it is still associated with high morbidity and mortality. Current management of large bone sarcomas typically includes the complex therapeutic approach of limb salvage or sacrifice combined with pre- and postoperative multidrug chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and is still associated with high recurrence rates. The development of cellular strategies against specific characteristics of tumour cells appears to be promising, as they can target cancer cells selectively. Recently, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have been the subject of significant research in orthopaedic clinical practice through their use in regenerative medicine. Further research has been directed at the use of MSCs for more personalized bone sarcoma treatments, taking advantage of their wide range of potential biological functions, which can be augmented by using tissue engineering approaches to promote healing of large defects. In this review, we explore the use of MSCs in bone sarcoma treatment, by analyzing MSCs and tumour cell interactions, transduction of MSCs to target sarcoma, and their clinical applications on humans concerning bone regeneration after bone sarcoma extraction.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epicardial adipose tissue has been associated with the development/progression of cardiovascular disease. We appraise the strength of the association between epicardial adipose tissue and development/progression of cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.RECENT FINDINGS: Cross-sectional clinical and translational correlative studies have established an association between epicardial adipose tissue and progression of coronary artery disease. Recent studies question this association and underline the need for longitudinal studies. Epicardial adipose tissue also plays a definite role in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation and its recurrence after ablation. In contrast to an early paradigm, epicardial adipose tissue does not appear to play a key role in the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in obese patients. The association of epicardial adipose tissue with atrial fibrillation is robust. In contrast, the association of epicardial adipose tissue with coronary artery disease and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is tenuous. Additional research, including longitudinal studies, is needed to confirm or refute these proposed associations.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding the human coronary arteries, secretes a wide range of adipocytokines affecting the biology of the adjacent vascular wall in a paracrine way. However, we have recently found that PVAT also behaves as a sensor of signals coming from the vascular wall, to which it reacts by changing its morphology and secretory profile. Indeed, vascular inflammation, a key feature of vascular disease pathogenesis, leads to the release of inflammatory signals that disseminate into local fat, inducing local lipolysis and inhibiting adipogenesis. This ability of PVAT to sense inflammatory signals from the vascular wall, can be used as a “thermometer” of the vascular wall, allowing for non-invasive detection of coronary inflammation. Vascular inflammation induces a shift of PVAT’s composition from lipid to aqueous phase, resulting into increased computed tomography (CT) attenuation around the inflamed artery, forming a gradient with increasing attenuation closer to the inflamed coronary artery wall. These spatial changes in PVAT’s attenuation are easily detected around culprit lesions during acute coronary syndromes. A new biomarker designed to captured these spatial changes in PVAT’s attenuation around the human coronary arteries, the Fat Attenuation Index (FAI), has additional predictive value in stable patients for cardiac mortality and non-fatal heart attacks, above the prediction provided by the current state of the art that includes risk factors, calcium score and presence of high risk plaque features. The use of perivascular FAI in clinical practice may change the way we interpret cardiovascular CT angiography, as it is applicable to any coronary CT angiogram, and it offers dynamic information about the inflammatory burden of the coronary arteries, providing potential guidance for preventive measures and invasive treatments.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-secreted packages that deliver cargo to target cells to effect functional and phenotypic changes. They are secreted by many different cell types, including adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which are a promising field of study in regenerative medicine. Our aim was to perform a systematic review of the literature to summarize the scientific work that has been conducted on ADSC EVs to date.METHODS: The Pubmed database was queried with keywords (and variations of) “adipose derived stem cell,” “stromal vascular fraction,” and “extracellular vesicles.” We excluded review papers, then manually screened articles based on title and abstract. Full-text articles were assessed for eligibility to include in final review.RESULTS: While an extensive body of research exists on EVs, a much smaller proportion of that is original research on ADSC EVs. Of 44 manuscripts that met our database search criteria, 21 articles were selected for our systematic review.CONCLUSION: ADSC EVs were found to exert effects on angiogenesis, cell survival and apoptosis, inflammation, tissue regeneration, and reduction of disease pathology. Further studies examine characteristics of ADSC EVs. Future work should aim to further detail the safety profiles of ADSC EVs given their potential for cell-based therapies. The body of research studies characterizing ADSC EVs continues to expand, and much work remains to be done before human pilot studies can be considered. To our knowledge, we offer the first systematic review summarizing the research on ADSC EVs and their determined roles to date.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: To determine the effects of left gastric artery embolization (LGAE) on computed tomography (CT) body composition change.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 1.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.8 months. Following LGAE, patients experienced significantly decreased body weight (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003), BMI (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005), EBW (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003), BFI (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03), SFI (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03), and SMI (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Changes in VFI and IMFI did not significantly change (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.13 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.83, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent LGAE had significant unintended weight loss as a result of decreased body fat and skeletal muscle. Body composition analysis can readily assess the extent of fat loss and identify muscle wasting.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the state of the art on the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in the microcirculation of patients with obesity, focusing on the complex relationship between the consolidated and the novel mechanisms involved in this alteration.RECENT FINDINGS: Human obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, caused by a reduced nitric oxide availability secondary to an enhanced oxidative stress production. Pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, secreted by perivascular adipose tissue, is a major mechanism whereby obesity is associated with a reduced vascular NO availability. Vasculature also represents a source of low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress which contribute to endothelial dysfunction in obese patients. Recently, a direct influence of arginase on endothelial function by reducing nitric oxide availability was demonstrated in small vessels from patients with severe obesity. This effect is modulated by ageing and related to the high levels of vascular oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and enzymatic pathways are important players in the pathophysiology of obesity-related vascular disease. The identification of new therapeutic approaches able to interfere with these mechanisms will result in more effective prevention of the cardiovascular complications associated with obesity.</p>

<p>Human adipose-derived stem cells localize in the stromal-vascular portion, and can be ex vivo isolated using a combination of washing steps and enzymatic digestion. For this study, we undertook a histological evaluation of traditional fat graft compared with fat graft enriched with stromal vascular fraction cells isolated by the Celution™ system to assess the interactions between cells and adipose tissue before the breast injection. In addition, we reported on histological analyses of biopsies derived from fat grafted (traditional or enriched with SVFs) in the breast in order to assess the quality of the adipose tissue, fibrosis and vessels. The hASCs derived from enzymatic digestion were systematically characterized for growth features, phenotype and multi-potent differentiation potential. They fulfill the definition of mesenchymal stem cells, albeit with a higher neural phenotype profile. These cells also express genes that constitute the core circuitry of self-renewal such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and neurogenic lineage genes such as NEUROD1, PAX6 and SOX3. Such findings support the hypothesis that hASCs may have a potential usefulness in neurodegenerative conditions. These data can be helpful for the development of new therapeutic approaches in personalized medicine to assess safety and efficacy of the breast reconstruction.</p>

<p>Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has become a regenerative tool for various diseases; however, legislation strictly regulates the clinical application of cell products using collagenase. Here, we present a protocol to generate an injectable mixture of SVF cells and native extracellular matrix from adipose tissue by a purely mechanical process. Lipoaspirates are put into a centrifuge and spun at 1,200 x g for 3 min. The middle layer is collected and separated into two layers (high-density fat at the bottom and low-density fat on the top). The upper layer is directly emulsified by intersyringe shifting, at a rate of 20 mL/s for 6x to 8x. The emulsified fat is centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 3 min, and the sticky substance under the oil layer is collected and defined as the extracellular matrix (ECM)/SVF-gel. The oil on the top layer is collected. Approximately 5 mL of oil is added to 15 mL of high-density fat and emulsified by intersyringe shifting, at a rate of 20 mL/s for 6x to 8x. The emulsified fat is centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 3 min, and the sticky substance is also ECM/SVF-gel. After the transplantation of the ECM/SVF-gel into nude mice, the graft is harvested and assessed by histologic examination. The result shows that this product has the potential to regenerate into normal adipose tissue. This procedure is a simple, effective mechanical dissociation procedure to condense the SVF cells embedded in their natural supportive ECM for regenerative purposes.</p>

<p>Implementation of tubular endothelial cell networks is a prerequisite for 3D tissue engineering of constructs with clinically relevant size as nourishment of cells is challenged by the diffusion limit. In vitro generation of 3D networks is often achieved under conditions using serum containing cell culture medium and/or animal derived matrices. Here, 3D endothelial cell networks were generated by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in combination with human adipose tissue derived stromal cells (hASCs) employing human collagen I as hydrogel and decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa as starter matrix. Matrigel/rat tail collagen I hydrogel was used as control. Resulting constructs were cultivated either in serum-free medium or in endothelial growth medium-2 serving as control. Endothelial cell networks were quantified, tested for lumen formation, and interaction of HUVECs and hASCs. Tube diameter was slightly larger in constructs containing human collagen I compared to Matrigel/rat tail collagen I constructs under serum-free conditions. All other network parameters were mostly similar. Thereby, the feasibility of generating 3D endothelial cell networks under serum-free culture conditions in human collagen I as hydrogel was demonstrated. In summary, the presented achievements pave the way for the generation of clinical applicable constructs.</p>

<p>Blood pressure (BP) is a highly heritable trait and a major cardiovascular disease risk factor. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated a number of susceptibility loci for systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. However, a large portion of the heritability cannot be explained by the top GWAS loci and a comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we utilized an integrative genomics approach that leveraged multiple genetic and genomic datasets including (a) GWAS for SBP and DBP from the International Consortium for Blood Pressure (ICBP), (b) expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from genetics of gene expression studies of human tissues related to BP, (c) knowledge-driven biological pathways, and (d) data-driven tissue-specific regulatory gene networks. Integration of these multidimensional datasets revealed tens of pathways and gene subnetworks in vascular tissues, liver, adipose, blood, and brain functionally associated with DBP and SBP. Diverse processes such as platelet production, insulin secretion/signaling, protein catabolism, cell adhesion and junction, immune and inflammation, and cardiac/smooth muscle contraction, were shared between DBP and SBP. Furthermore, “Wnt signaling” and “mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling” pathways were found to be unique to SBP, while “cytokine network”, and “tryptophan catabolism” to DBP. Incorporation of gene regulatory networks in our analysis informed on key regulator genes that orchestrate tissue-specific subnetworks of genes whose variants together explain ~20% of BP heritability. Our results shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying BP regulation and highlight potential novel targets and pathways for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Stem cells are defined by their potential for self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into numerous cell types, including cartilage and bone cells. Although basic laboratory studies demonstrate that cell therapies have strong potential for improvement in tissue healing and regeneration, there is little evidence in the scientific literature for many of the available cell formulations that are currently offered to patients. Numerous commercial entities and ‘regenerative medicine centres’ have aggressively marketed unproven cell therapies for a wide range of medical conditions, leading to sometimes indiscriminate use of these treatments, which has added to the confusion and unpredictable outcomes. The significant variability and heterogeneity in cell formulations between different individuals makes it difficult to draw conclusions about efficacy. The ‘minimally manipulated’ preparations derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue that are currently used differ substantially from cells that are processed and prepared under defined laboratory protocols. The term ‘stem cells’ should be reserved for laboratory-purified, culture-expanded cells. The number of cells in uncultured preparations that meet these defined criteria is estimated to be approximately one in 10 000 to 20 000 (0.005% to 0.01%) in native bone marrow and 1 in 2000 in adipose tissue. It is clear that more refined definitions of stem cells are required, as the lumping together of widely diverse progenitor cell types under the umbrella term ‘mesenchymal stem cells’ has created confusion among scientists, clinicians, regulators, and our patients. Validated methods need to be developed to measure and characterize the ‘critical quality attributes’ and biological activity of a specific cell formulation. It is certain that ‘one size does not fit all’ - different cell formulations, dosing schedules, and culturing parameters will likely be required based on the tissue being treated and the desired biological target. As an alternative to the use of exogenous cells, in the future we may be able to stimulate the intrinsic vascular stem cell niche that is known to exist in many tissues. The tremendous potential of cell therapy will only be realized with further basic, translational, and clinical research. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2019;101-B:361-364.</p>

<p>Fat-related traits have great influences on pork quality. As different fat tissues have different biochemical profiles depending on their location, intramuscular fat contributes to gustatory qualities, while subcutaneous fat is considered as a negative factor associated with growth performance. In this study, both primary intramuscular and subcutaneous vascular stem cells (IVSCs and SVSCs) could be differentiated into mature adipocytes, though the IVSC differentiation efficiency was lower. By comparative analysis of transcriptomes, 2524 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found between two VSCs before differentiation, while only 551 DEGs were found and enriched in two pathways including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids after differentiation. This result indicated that differentiated VSCs were more similar. During differentiation, more DEGs existed in IVSCs than that in SVSCs, suggesting that adipogenesis of IVSCs might be more complex. Additionally, the expression level of DEGs involved in the adipogenic process helps to explain the difference of differentiation efficiency between IVSCs and SVSCs.</p>

<p>Obesity has many deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, mediated by changes in insulin sensitivity, dyslipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. Current therapies mainly focus on caloric intake suppression and bariatric surgery, however the efficacy of these approaches remains elusive as most patients regain their body weight within the next 5<U+202F>years. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity is of paramount importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent vascular complications. Autophagy has emerged as key self-degrading process responsible for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Defects in autophagy homeostasis are implicated in metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Most importantly, autophagy regulates animal lifespan. Albeit ample preclinical evidence supports the therapeutic promise of autophagy modulators for the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases, the clinical efficacy of pharmacological modulation of autophagy remains to be proven. Recent work has shown that GLP-1-based therapeutic approaches may positively affect autophagy in perivascular adipose tissue, thus improving obesity-related endothelial dysfunction. In the present review we discuss current evidence on the role of autophagy in obesity, with a specific focus on DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) as modulators of this process. Experimental evidence on GLP-1-based approaches is critically discussed in light of recent clinical trials with DPP-4i and GLP-1 RA.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: There are no known treatments that halt or reverse chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats. In rodent models, stem cell treatment has been associated with improvement in renal function parameters, especially when stem cells were delivered intra-arterially to the kidney. To date, only IV and intrarenal stem cell infusions have been studied in cats with CKD with no clinically relevant improvement noted.OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and feasibility of intra-arterial delivery of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) to the kidney in cats with CKD.ANIMALS: Five client-owned domestic cats with International Renal Interest Society stage III CKD.METHODS: Prospective cohort study (phase I clinical trial). Adipose tissue was harvested from study animals on day 0. On days 2 and 14, an infusion of MSC in SVF was administered into the renal artery via the femoral or carotid artery using fluoroscopic guidance. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentration, plasma iohexol clearance, and quality of life assessments were monitored between days 0 and 90.RESULTS: The procedure was performed successfully in all cats. No severe adverse events were observed in any cat during the study period.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Intra-arterial infusion of MSC into the renal artery in CKD cats was feasible and safe within a 3-month postoperative period. Efficacy and long-term safety have yet to be established. This procedure requires careful technique and training.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Synthetic implants are being used to restore injured or damaged tissues following cancer resection and congenital diseases. However, the survival of large tissue implant replacements depends on their ability to support angiogenesis that if limited, causes extrusion and infection of the implant. This study assessed the beneficial effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on synthetic biomaterials in combination with argon plasma surface modification to enhance vascularisation of tissue-engineered constructs.METHODS: Non-biodegradable polyurethane scaffolds were manufactured and modified with plasma surface modification using argon gas (PM). Donor rats were then used to extract ADSCs and PRP to modify the scaffolds further. Scaffolds with and without PM were modified with and without ADSCs and PRP and subcutaneously implanted in the dorsum of rats for 3<U+2009>months. After 12<U+2009>weeks, the scaffolds were excised and the degree of tissue integration using H&amp;E staining and Masson’s trichrome staining, angiogenesis by CD31 and immune response by CD45 and CD68 immunohistochemistry staining was examined.RESULTS: H&amp;E and Masson’s trichrome staining showed PM+PRP+ADSC and PM+ADSC scaffolds had the greatest tissue integration, but there was no significant difference between the two scaffolds (p &lt;<U+2009>0.05). The greatest vessel formation after 3<U+2009>months was shown with PM+PRP+ADSC and PM+ADSC scaffolds using CD31 staining compared to all other scaffolds (p &lt;<U+2009>0.05). The CD45 and CD68 staining was similar between all scaffolds after 3<U+2009>months showing the ADSCs or PRP had no effect on the immune response of the scaffolds.CONCLUSIONS: Argon plasma surface modification enhanced the effect of adipose-derived stem cells effect on angiogenesis and tissue integration of polyurethane scaffolds. The combination of ADSCs and argon plasma modification may improve the survival of large tissue implants for regenerative applications.</p>

<p>Furlow palatoplasty is increasingly used both for primary palatoplasty and for secondary correction of velopharyngeal insufficiency. Although Furlow palatoplasty offers the advantage of lengthening the palate, the most tenuous component of the oral mucosal repair is anterior transposition of the oral mucosal Z-plasty flap, with superficial separation of the oral mucosa observed in up to 53 percent of cases of secondary Furlow palatoplasty. To mitigate this problem, the authors prophylactically placed pedicled buccal fat pad flaps to provide an additional vascular layer to promote healing of the overlying oral mucosal Z-plasty flap. The authors report their experience comprising seven patients who underwent Furlow palatoplasty with buccal fat flap augmentation. Four of these patients had secondary Furlow palatoplasty procedures; one of them experienced oral mucosal separation that healed uneventfully. No patients developed an oronasal fistula. The authors’ experience suggests that buccal fat flaps may minimize vascular compromise and dehiscence of the oral mucosal Z-plasty following Furlow palatoplasty.

<p>BACKGROUND: Several methods to prepare the recipient site in fat grafting have been proposed in recent decades. However, to date, these procedures have never been reviewed exhaustively. The purpose of the present study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the different techniques to prepare the recipient site for fat grafting as they were investigated in preclinical studies, with resulting outcomes and underlying mechanisms of action.METHODS: The PubMed/MEDLINE database was queried to search for preclinical investigations on the preparation of the recipient site in fat grafting using the following algorithm: ((recipient site) AND (fat grafting) OR (lipofilling) OR (lipograft)). A priori criteria were applied to review the resulting articles.RESULTS: Thirteen animal studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, five techniques were identified: external volume expansion, implantation of alloplastic material (silicone sheets), administration of cell-proliferation factors (i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor, adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction, and interleukin-8), ischemia, and microneedling. A positive effect on cellular activity (cell proliferation and angiogenesis) was demonstrated by all studies and achieved with all techniques. Seven of the eight authors who examined this aspect reported enhancement of fat graft survival.CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of fat grafting surgical outcomes is documented preclinically using different recipient-site preparation techniques, particularly through enhancement of vascularization and soft-tissue expansion. This understanding will lead to further clinical research, especially for those cases where improvement of the recipient site is recommended, such as contracted scars or preirradiated tissues.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Nanofat and fat graft survival is an important clinical problem. The authors of this study investigated whether PRP has an impact on fat and nanofat graft survival and vascularization in a mouse model.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fat was harvested from a 50-year-old healthy woman by vacuum suction, and nanofat was obtained by emulsification and centrifugation procedures. PRP was collected after two rounds of centrifugation from an autologous blood sample. Twenty male nude mice were divided into four treatment groups: PRP/nanofat, PRP/fat, saline/nanofat and saline/fat. After 1 month and 3 months, the grafts were extracted and weighed. The microstructure of the fat and nanofat was examined with a scanning electron microscope. HE and immunohistochemical staining was applied to observe neovascularization. Western blot analysis was used to analyse the expression of CD31 and VEGF.RESULTS: In fat tissue, fat cells had normal connections; the fat structure was complete and fibre networks were visible. In nanofat, the extracellular matrix vascular components were visible and their structures were intact. At 1 month and 3 months, the graft weights in the PRP/fat group were significantly higher than those in the other groups. Further, a higher degree of neovascularization was observed in the PRP/nanofat group, and the expression of CD31 and VEGF in the PRP/nanofat group was higher than that in the other groups.CONCLUSION: PRP can promote nanofat and fat graft survival and vascularization.NO LEVEL ASSIGNED: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

<p>Obesity is already a major global public health issue, implicated in a vast array of conditions affecting multiple body systems. It is now also firmly established as an independent risk factor in the incidence and progression of AF. The rapidly rising morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with AF despite implementation of the three pillars of AF management - anticoagulation, rate control and rhythm control - suggest other strategies need to be considered. Compelling data has unveiled novel insights into adipose tissue biology and its effect on arrhythmogenesis while secondary prevention strategies targeting obesity as part of a comprehensive risk factor management programme have been demonstrated to be highly effective. Here, the authors review the epidemiological basis of the obesity-AF relationship, consider its underlying pathophysiology and discuss new therapeutic opportunities on the horizon.</p>

<p>Background Overweight and obese individuals have a reduced life expectancy due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, stroke and cancer. Systemic inflammation and premature telomere shortening have been discussed as potential mechanisms linking these conditions. We investigated the relation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) distribution to leukocyte relative telomere length (RTL). Methods We measured RTL in 375 participants of the observational STYJOBS/EDECTA cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00482924) using a qPCR based method. SAT distribution was determined by lipometry yielding a percent body fat value and SAT thicknesses at 15 standardized locations across the entire body. A correlation analysis between RTL, age, sex, lipometry data and conventional body measures (body mass index [BMI], waist-, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio) was calculated. The strongest determinants of RTL were determined by a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results RTL was not associated with age or sex. RTL was significantly negatively correlated with BMI, percent body fat, waist-, hip circumference and waist-to-height ratio. Furthermore, RTL correlated with SAT at the following locations: neck, triceps, biceps, upper back, front chest, lateral chest, upper abdomen, lower abdomen, lower back, hip, front thigh, lateral thigh, rear thigh and calf. Stepwise regression analysis revealed nuchal and hip SAT as the strongest predictors of RTL. No significant association was seen between RTL and waist-to-hip ratio. Conclusions RTL is negatively associated with parameters describing body fat composure. Nuchal and hip SAT thicknesses are the strongest predictors of RTL. Central obesity appears to correlate with premature genomic aging.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is a rich source of multi-potent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) capable of differentiating into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Adipogenic differentiation of progenitor cells is a major mechanism driving adipose tissue expansion and dysfunction in response to obesity. Understanding changes to perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is thus clinically relevant in metabolic disease. However, previous studies have been predominately performed in the mouse and other animal models. This protocol uses human thoracic PVAT samples collected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Adipose tissue from the ascending aorta was collected and used for explantation of the stromal vascular fraction. We previously confirmed the presence of adipose progenitor cells in human PVAT with the capacity to differentiate into lipid-containing adipocytes. In this study, we further analyzed the differentiation potential of cells from the stromal vascular fraction, presumably containing multi-potent progenitor cells. We compared PVAT-derived cells to human bone marrow MSC for differentiation into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Following 14 days of differentiation, specific stains were utilized to detect lipid accumulation in adipocytes (Oil red O), calcific deposits in osteogenic cells (Alizarin Red), or glycosaminoglycans and collagen in chondrogenic cells (Masson’s Trichrome). While bone marrow MSC efficiently differentiated into all three lineages, PVAT-derived cells had adipogenic and chondrogenic potential, but lacked robust osteogenic potential.</p>

<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary arterial endothelial hyperproliferation and dysfunction. Restoration of endothelial function is a common goal of available treatments. In the present study, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) were co-cultured with monocrotaline pyrrole-treated human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs); increased proliferation of HPAECs and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed. High throughput sequencing results showed that six microRNAs (miMNAs) of ASCs were significantly dysregulated. In monocrotaline-induced PAH rat models, ASC transplantation improved the right ventricle systolic pressure, right ventricle hypertrophy and pulmonary endothelium hyperproliferation, and four of the six miRNAs were validated in the lung tissue samples. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that these dysregulated miRNAs were involved in the regulation of transcription, signal transduction, negative regulation of cell proliferation through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling pathway and P53 signaling pathway. Our data indicates that the unique six miRNA expression signature could be involved in the PAH endothelial repair by ASCs.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: The characterization of atherosclerotic carotid plaque plays a key role in the identification of patients at risk. The aim of our work was to evaluate the potentialities of carotid computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in assessing composition of atherosclerotic plaque.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 29 patients (7 women and 22 men, age range 54-81; mean age 69) who underwent carotid endarterectomy. All patients underwent pre-surgical CCTA using a 320-slice scanner. Post-processing reconstructions and analysis were performed using a specific software. Percentage of three different components of the atherosclerotic plaque (adipose, fibrotic and calcific) were classified based on Hounsfield unit values. Post-processing results were compared with histological analysis. Vessel and plaque parameters were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Bland-Altman plots with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for correlation. McNemar’s test was used for comparison of dichotomous variables.RESULTS: A significant correlation between histology and CCTA was found with respect to the areas corresponding to adipose, fibrotic and calcified plaques. The existence of proportional bias was observed between the two quantifying methods with lower discrepancies found for the adipose and fibrotic plaque areas. The Bland-Altman analyses showed a mean bias of 3.2%, 2.5% and 0.6% between histology and CCTA, for adipose, fibrotic and calcified plaque areas, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Multi-detector CT angiography represents a valuable technique to assess quantitatively the composition of atherosclerotic plaques, with particular reference to the prevalence of fibrotic tissue, and is a useful diagnostic tool to improve risk stratification of patients for cerebral stroke.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Adipose tissue acts as an active endocrine organ and may be involved in the biological mechanism of stroke. Adipokines can serve as key messenger of central energy and metabolic homeostasis and can contribute to the crosstalk between adipose tissue and brain. Recent research has offered vague data on the relationships between adipose tissue, adipokines, and vascular disorders. We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of serum leptin, adiponectin and visfatin levels and functional outcomes in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular diseases.METHODS: Thirty-five patients with acurte intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), 35 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. A sandwich ELISA was developed to measure the presence of serum adiponectin, leptin and visfatin levels.RESULTS: Serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, leptin, visfatin levels and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher and serum adiponectin levels were lower in patients at admission compared with healthy volunteers.CONCLUSION: According to the novel study, it was suggested that elevated serum leptin as well as visfatin and decreased adiponectin levels may be a sign of cerebrovascular disease and as part of the response occurring in stroke patients.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability across the world, which its prevalence is relatively high in elder population. Current accepted therapies such as exercise, anti-inflammatory drugs and intra-articular inoculation of corticosteroids are aimed at controlling symptoms in the affected patients. Surgical options including arthroplasty, osteotomy and joint replacement are other choices of treatment, which are invasive and can be applied in case of failure of conventional therapies. In the last few decades, efforts to treat musculoskeletal diseases are being increasingly focused on regenerative cellular therapies. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which obtained from adipose tissue, contains a variety of cells include mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and has shown to be effective in cartilage repair. Autologous blood products such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) act as an adjuvant of surgical treatment and its intra-articular delivery has shown beneficial effects for OA treatment. Given the efficacy of such treatment approaches in OA, this paper discusses both preclinical and clinical evidence with major focus on clinical trials.</p>

<p>Besides being an energy storage, adipose tissue is an endocrine organ closely associated with vascular system. Human relevant in vitro models are needed to study adipose tissue and related diseases. Vasculature plays a central role in the development and inhibition of adipose tissue related diseases. Here, adipocyte culture was established from hASC (human adipose stromal cells), and a vascularized adipose tissue model was established from hASC and HUVEC (human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell) co-culture, utilizing the same differentiation procedure. Using these models together allowed analysis of the effect of vascularization on adipocytes. Adipocyte culture and Vascularized adipose tissue model were characterized on gene (adipocyte and vasculature-related), protein (von Willebrand factor, CollagenIV, CD140b and CD144, secretion of leptin, adiponectin and FABP4) and functional (triglyceride accumulation, glucose uptake and lipolysis) levels. Additionally, vascularized adipose tissue model was exposed to chemicals with known effects on adipogenesis and angiogenesis (rosiglitazone, chlorpyrifos, prochloraz, mancozeb, butylparaben, 15-deoxy-d12,14-prostaglandin j2, bisphenol a, bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, tributyltin chloride) to compare their effects to the literature. The in vitro vascularized adipose tissue model showed presence of functional adipocytes and extensive vascular network. Adipocytes and the vasculature showed relevant gene and protein markers. Insulin induced glucose uptake, inhibited lipolysis and influenced vasculature-related genes. The results showed that vasculature led to faster insulin response in lipolysis inhibition and modulated responses to chemicals. This novel thoroughly characterized vascularized adipose tissue model is a promising new tool for studying adipose tissue as well as effect of chemicals on adipogenesis and angiogenesis in adipose tissue.</p>

<p>The medial collateral ligament of the knee joint is one of the most commonly injured ligaments of the knee. Recent data have shown that the thin layer of connective tissue covering the ligament, known as the epiligament, is essential for its nutrition and normal function, as well as its healing after injury. The aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the changes in the epiligament of the medial collateral ligament which occurred during operative and non-operative treatment throughout the first month after injury. We used 27 male Wistar rats randomly allocated to three groups. In the 9 rats belonging to the first group, the medial collateral ligament was fully transected and left to heal spontaneously without suture. In the 9 rats belonging to the second group, the transected ends were marked with a 9-0 nylon monofilament suture. The 9 rats in the third group were used as normal controls. Three animals from each group were sacrificed on days 8, 16, and 30 after injury. Light microscopic analysis was performed on semi-thin sections stained with 1% methylene blue, azure II, and basic fuchsin. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study and compare the ultrastructural changes in the epiligament. The statistical analysis of the obtained data was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mood’s median test. The normal structure of the epiligament of the medial collateral ligament was presented by fibroblasts, fibrocytes, adipose cells, mast cells, collagen fibers, and neuro-vascular bundles. On days 8 and 16 postinjury, the epiligament appeared hypercellular and returned to its normal appearance on the thirtieth day postinjury. The electron microscopic study revealed the presence of different types of fibroblasts with the typical ultrastructural features of collagen-synthetizing cells. The comparative statistical analysis on the respective day showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of cells between spontaneously healing animals and animals recovering with suture application. These data further prove that spontaneous healing of the medial collateral ligament yields similar results to surgical treatment and may be used as a basis for the development of treatment regimens with improved patient outcome.</p>

<p>Obese adipose tissue expansion is an inflammatory process that results in dysregulated lipolysis, increased circulating lipids, ectopic lipid deposition, and systemic insulin resistance. Lymphatic vessels provide a route of fluid, macromolecule, and immune cell clearance, and lymphangiogenesis increases this capability. Indeed, inflammation-associated lymphangiogenesis is critical in resolving acute and chronic inflammation, but it is largely absent in obese adipose tissue. Enhancing adipose tissue lymphangiogenesis could, therefore, improve metabolism in obesity. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of murine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D under a tightly controlled Tet-On promoter were crossed with adipocyte-specific adiponectin-reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator mice (Adipo-VD) to stimulate adipose tissue-specific lymphangiogenesis during 16-week high-fat diet-induced obesity. Adipose VEGF-D overexpression induced de novo lymphangiogenesis in murine adipose tissue, and obese Adipo-VD mice exhibited enhanced glucose clearance, lower insulin levels, and reduced liver triglycerides. On ß-3 adrenergic stimulation, Adipo-VD mice exhibited more rapid and increased glycerol flux from adipose tissue, suggesting that the lymphatics are a potential route of glycerol clearance. Resident macrophage crown-like structures were scarce and total F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages were reduced in obese Adipo-VD s.c. adipose tissue with evidence of increased immune trafficking from the tissue. Augmenting VEGF-D signaling and lymphangiogenesis specifically in adipose tissue, therefore, reduces obesity-associated immune accumulation and improves metabolic responsiveness.</p>

<p>AIMS: Secreted factors produced by adipose tissue are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We previously identified adipolin, also known as C1q/Tnf-related protein 12, as an insulin-sensitizing adipokine. However, the role of adipolin in vascular disease remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether adipolin modulates pathological vascular remodeling.METHODS AND RESULTS: Adipolin-knockout (APL-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to wire-induced injury of the femoral artery. APL-KO mice showed increased neointimal thickening after vascular injury compared with WT mice, which was accompanied by an enhanced inflammatory response and vascular cell proliferation in injured arteries. Adipolin deficiency also led to a reduction in TGF-ß1 protein levels in injured arteries. Treatment of cultured macrophages with adipolin protein led to a reduction in LPS-stimulated expression of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL) 6, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1. These effects were reversed by inhibition of transforming growth factor-ß receptor II (TGF-ßRII)/Smad2 signaling. Adipolin also reduced platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-stimulated proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through a TGF-ßRII/Smad2-dependent pathway. Furthermore, adipolin treatment significantly increased TGF-ß1 concentration in media from cultured VSMCs and macrophages.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that adipolin protects against the development of pathological vascular remodeling by attenuating macrophage inflammatory responses and VSMC proliferation.</p>

<p>Studies have implicated the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose tissue in insulin resistance. The proteoglycan decorin, a component of ECM, has been associated with glucose tolerance, but possible causal effects on metabolism remain to be explored. We here sought to determine metabolic consequences of loss of decorin in mice (DcnKO). DcnKO mice were fed a low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet for 10 weeks and body weight and food intake was recorded. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed after eight weeks. Blood samples and adipose, liver and muscle tissues were collected at sacrifice. Global gene expression was measured in adipose tissue, and expression of decorin was also analyzed in human adipose samples. DcnKO mice showed increased feed efficiency during overfeeding and impaired glucose tolerance. Adipose leptin mRNA and circulating leptin levels were elevated in DcnKO mice, along with a downregulation of genes involved in ECM organization and triglyceride biosynthesis, and an upregulation of adipose genes involved in complement and coagulation cascades. Consistent with a protective metabolic role for decorin, in obese patients we found increased adipose decorin expression after profound fat loss, particularly in the stromal vascular fraction. Loss of decorin in mice caused impaired glucose tolerance in association with increased feed efficiency and altered gene expression in adipose tissue. Our data provide evidence that decorin is an important factor for maintaining glucose tolerance.</p>

<p>METHODS: The study included 88 obese patients (BMI<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>35<U+2009>kg/m2) treated at the Kaliningrad Region Hospital. The control group consisted of 20 healthy donors. To measure mtDNA copy number we used droplet digital PCR. The concentrations of molecules (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) were measured in plasma using the following sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Quantitative determination of leptin was evaluated by flow-fluorimetry on a «Bio-Plex Protein Assay System». Statistical analysis and graphs were obtained in R Statistical Software (version 3.3.1).RESULTS: The systemic character of chronic subclinical inflammation in obesity is established, and an increase in the level of endothelial dysfunction molecules was observed in the blood plasma. The levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 were positively correlated with increases in BMI, serum glucose and cholesterol levels.CONCLUSIONS: The copy number of mtDNA in various fat stores was higher in obese patients with type 2 diabetes than in obese patients without diabetes or in the control subjects and was related to the levels of leptin and proinflammatory cytokines.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The adipose tissue (AT) is a secretory organ producing a wide variety of factors that participate in the genesis of metabolic disorders linked to excess fat mass. Weight loss improves obesity-related disorders.OBJECTIVES: Transcriptomic studies on human AT, and a combination of analyses of transcriptome and proteome profiling of conditioned media from adipocytes and stromal cells isolated from human AT, have led to the identification of apolipoprotein M (apoM) as a putative adipokine. We aimed to validate apoM as novel adipokine, investigate the relation of AT APOM expression with metabolic syndrome and insulin sensitivity, and study the regulation of its expression in AT and secretion during calorie restriction-induced weight loss.METHODS: We examined APOM mRNA level and secretion in AT from 485 individuals enrolled in 5 independent clinical trials, and in vitro in human multipotent adipose-derived stem cell adipocytes. APOM expression and secretion were measured during dieting.RESULTS: APOM was expressed in human subcutaneous and visceral AT, mainly by adipocytes. ApoM was released into circulation from AT, and plasma apoM concentrations correlate with AT APOM mRNA levels. In AT, APOM expression inversely correlated with adipocyte size, was lower in obese compared to lean individuals, and reduced in subjects with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Regardless of fat depot, there was a positive relation between AT APOM expression and systemic insulin sensitivity, independently of fat mass and plasma HDL cholesterol. In human multipotent adipose-derived stem cell adipocytes, APOM expression was enhanced by insulin-sensitizing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists and inhibited by tumor necrosis factor a, a cytokine that causes insulin resistance. In obese individuals, calorie restriction increased AT APOM expression and secretion.CONCLUSIONS: ApoM is a novel adipokine, the expression of which is a hallmark of healthy AT and is upregulated by calorie restriction. AT apoM deserves further investigation as a potential biomarker of risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are rare benign tumors derived from mesenchymal tissue and composed of varying degrees of adipose tissue, muscle and blood vessels. Renal AMLs (RAMLs) are the result of a sporadic event, and, in most of cases, the diagnosis is usually incidental, but hemorrhage and shock may be present. During pregnancy, the size of AMLs may increase and they may rupture, probably due to the high expression of hormone receptors, and the increase in maternal circulation and abdominal pressure. The authors present a case of a woman with ruptured RAML submitted to urgent endovascular treatment four days after giving birth by cesarean section.Angiomiolipomas (AMLs) são tumores benignos raros derivados do tecido mesenquimal, compostos em graus variados de tecido adiposo, muscular e de vasos sanguíneos. Os AMLs renais (AMLRs) resultam de um evento esporádico e, na maioria dos casos, o diagnóstico costuma ser fortuito, mas quadros de hemorragia e choque podem estar presentes. Durante a gestação, os AMLs podem aumentar de tamanho e romper, provavelmente pela alta expressão de receptores hormonais, e pelo aumento da circulação materna e da pressão abdominal. Os autores apresentam um caso de uma paciente com AMLR roto submetida a tratamento endovascular de urgência no quarto dia pós-operatório de uma cesariana.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSCs) are multipotent stromal cells. The cells secrete a number of cytokines and growth factors and show immunoregulatory and proangiogenic properties. Their properties may be used to repair damaged tissues. The aim of our work is to explain the muscle damage repair mechanism with the utilization of the human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hADSCs).CONCLUSIONS: The proposed mechanism for the repair of the damaged muscle using hADSCs is based on the activity of IL-6. In our opinion, the cytokine, secreted by the hADSCs, stimulates the M2 macrophages responsible for repairing damaged muscle and forming new blood vessels.</p>

<p>Chronic low-grade inflammation and increased serum levels of the cytokine IL-6 accompany obesity. For brain-produced IL-6, the mechanisms by which it controls energy balance and its role in obesity remain unclear. Here, we show that brain-produced IL-6 is decreased in obese mice and rats in a neuroanatomically and sex-specific manner. Reduced IL-6 mRNA localized to lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN) astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, including paraventricular hypothalamus-innervating lPBN neurons. IL-6 microinjection into lPBN reduced food intake and increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis in male lean and obese rats by increasing thyroid and sympathetic outflow to BAT. Parabrachial IL-6 interacted with leptin to reduce feeding. siRNA-mediated reduction of lPBN IL-6 leads to increased weight gain and adiposity, reduced BAT thermogenesis, and increased food intake. Ambient cold exposure partly normalizes the obesity-induced suppression of lPBN IL-6. These results indicate that lPBN-produced IL-6 regulates feeding and metabolism and pinpoints (patho)physiological contexts interacting with lPBN IL-6.</p>

<p>Angiolipoma, a subtype of lipoma, is a benign adypocytic soft tissue tumor composed of mature adipose tissue and small vascular proliferations. This entity makes up 5-17% of all lipomas. The diagnosis is made by clinical and pathological examination, ultrasonography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is generally an encapsulated tumor (noninfiltrative), but rarely has an infiltrative form. Angiolipoma mostly occurs on the trunk and extremities with male predominance. The forearm is the most frequent location for angiolipomas. It is very rarely seen on the fingers. Herein, we report a patient with solitary noninfiltrating angiolipoma on a finger. The patient was treated with surgical excision and no recurrence has been noted over one year of observation.</p>

<p>Thyroid carcinoma (TC) is rare in children, particularly in those aged &lt; 10 years. Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between neoplasms and hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are often associated with a higher risk for and/or aggressiveness of the neoplasm. Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) with autosomal recessive inheritance is a rare disease and is characterized by the lack of adipose tissue, severe insulin resistance, and early metabolic disturbances. Here, we reported a rare case of a type 2 CGL in a girl who presented with a papillary TC (PTC) at the age of 7 years. She had no family history of TC or previous exposure to ionizing radiation. She had a generalized lack of subcutaneous fat, including the palmar and plantar regions, muscle hypertrophy, intense acanthosis nigricans, hepatomegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, severe insulin resistance, and hypoleptinemia. A genetic analysis revealed a mutation in the BSCL2 gene (p.Thr109Asnfs* 5). Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic solid nodule measuring 1.8 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm, and fine needle aspiration biopsy suggested malignancy. Total thyroidectomy was performed, and a histopathological examination confirmed PTC with vascular invasion and parathyroid lymph node metastasis (pT3N1Mx stage). This is the first report to describe a case of differentiated TC in a child with CGL. Severe insulin resistance that is generally observed in patients with CGL early in life, especially in those with type 2 CGL, may be associated with this uncommon presentation of aggressive PTC during childhood.</p>

<p>Obesity has become a global health-threat for every age group. It is well known that young mice (10-12 weeks of age) fed a western-type diet (WD) become obese and develop higher cholesterol levels and liver steatosis whereas insulin sensitivity is reduced. Less is known, however, about the effect of a WD on advanced-age mice. Therefore, 10 week-old (young) and 22 month-old (advanced-age), male C57BL/6JRj mice were kept on either a WD or a control diet (SFD) for 15 weeks. In contrast to young mice, advanced-age mice on WD did not show a higher body weight or adipose tissue (AT)-masses, suggesting a protection against diet-induced obesity. Furthermore, plasma adiponectin and leptin levels were not affected upon WD-feeding. A WD, however, did induce more hepatic lipid accumulation as well as increased hepatic expression of the macrophage marker F4/80, in advanced-age mice. There were no significant differences in mRNA levels of uncoupling protein-1 or F4/80 in brown AT (BAT) or of several intestinal integrity markers in colon suggesting that the protection against obesity is not due to excessive BAT or to impaired intestinal absorption of fat. Thus, advanced-age mice, in contrast to their younger counterparts, appeared to be protected against diet-induced obesity.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the use of cryopreserved fat tissue for soft tissue augmentation is common, except for its unpredictable fat graft absorption, and the toxicity of the cryoprotective agent remains a limitation. In this study, the effects of freezing stored fat tissue without a cryoprotector, and the addition of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) on the survival of cryopreserved transplants was studied.METHODS: Lipoaspirates from six donors were processed and cryopreserved at -<U+2009>20 °C, -<U+2009>80 °C and -<U+2009>196 °C, respectively. The authors evaluated the lipoaspirates in vitro, on the basis of fat tissue and SVF viability after cryopreservation. In vivo fat grafting was performed in nude mice. Six trenches were injected on the backs of mice. Cryopreserved tissues (-<U+2009>20 °C, -<U+2009>80 °C and -<U+2009>196 °C) were injected on the right side, and the other side received the SVF combination. At 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation, the authors examined the weight, volume and morphology of the tissue and analyzed histochemical staining and immunohistochemistry (i.e., DIL, CD31 and VWF) to evaluate the survival of the fat grafts.RESULTS: After cryopreservation without the cryoprotective agent, adipose tissue maintained its morphology better in -<U+2009>80 °C than -<U+2009>20 °C and -<U+2009>196 °C. SVF cells can retain their adhesive and proliferative properties after cryopreservation. Although cryopreservation caused damage to fat tissue, all explants showed intact adipocytes and vascular ingrowth. Most of all, the -<U+2009>80 °C group had less graft resorption and fibrosis than the other temperature groups. There was increased survival of fat grafts in the SVF group compared with the control group.CONCLUSION: In this study, the authors demonstrated that the storage temperature of -<U+2009>80 °C was promising for 3 months of adipose tissue cryopreservation without a cryoprotective agent, and SVF could increase the survival rate of cryopreserved fat tissue.NO LEVEL ASSIGNED: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

<p>Wrist osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common conditions encountered by hand surgeons with limited efficacy of non-surgical treatments. The purpose of this study is to describe the Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) mixed-microfat biological characteristics of an experimental Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) needed for clinical trial authorization and describe the clinical results obtained from our first three patients 12 months after treatment (NCT03164122). Biological characterization of microfat, PRP and mixture were analysed in vitro according to validated methods. Patients with stage four OA according to the Kellgren Lawrence classification, with failure to conservative treatment and a persistent daily painful condition &gt;40 mm according to the visual analog scale (VAS) were treated. Microfat-PRP ATMP is a product with high platelet purity, conserved viability of stromal vascular fraction cells, chondrogenic differentiation capacity in vitro and high secretion of IL-1Ra anti-inflammatory cytokine. For patients, the only side effect was pain at the adipose tissue harvesting sites. Potential efficacy was observed with a pain decrease of over 50% (per VAS score) and the achievement of minimal clinically important differences for DASH and PRWE functional scores at one year in all three patients. Microfat-PRP ATMP presented a good safety profile after an injection in wrist OA. Efficacy trials are necessary to assess whether this innovative strategy could delay the necessity to perform non-conservative surgery.</p>

<p>AIMS: We studied the effect of metformin on the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in a fructose-rich-fed model, focusing on BAT proliferation, differentiation, and thermogenic markers.MAIN METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice received isoenergetic diets for ten weeks: control (C) or high-fructose (F). For additional eight weeks, animals received metformin hydrochloride (M, 250<U+2009>mg/kg/day) or saline. After sacrifice, BAT and white fat pads were prepared for light microscopy and molecular analyses.KEY FINDINGS: Body mass gain, white fat pads, and adiposity index were not different among the groups. There was a reduction in energy intake in the F group and energy expenditure in the F and FM groups. Metformin led to a more massive BAT in both groups CM and FM, associated with a higher adipocyte proliferation (ß1-adrenergic receptor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and vascular endothelial growth factor), and differentiation (PR domain containing 16, bone morphogenetic protein 7), in part by activating 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. Metformin also enhanced thermogenic markers in the BAT (uncoupling protein type 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha) through adrenergic stimuli and fibroblast growth factor 21. Metformin might improve mitochondrial biogenesis in the BAT (nuclear respiratory factor 1, mitochondrial transcription factor A), lipolysis (perilipin, adipose triglyceride lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase), and fatty acid uptake (lipoprotein lipase, cluster of differentiation 36, adipocyte protein 2).SIGNIFICANCE: Metformin effects are not linked to body mass changes, but affect BAT thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and fatty acid uptake. Therefore, BAT may be a metformin adjuvant target for the treatment of metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>Exercise promotes adipose remodeling and improves obesity-induced metabolic disorders through mechanisms that remain obscure. Here, we identify the FGF21 signaling in adipose tissues as an obligatory molecular transducer of exercise conferring its metabolic benefits in mice. Long-term high fat diet-fed obese mice exhibit compromised effects of exogenous FGF21 on alleviation of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied with markedly reduced expression of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) and ß-Klotho (KLB) in adipose tissues. These impairments in obese mice are reversed by treadmill exercise. Mice lacking adipose KLB are refractory to exercise-induced alleviation of insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, and ectopic lipid accumulation due to diminished adiponectin production, excessive fatty acid release, and enhanced adipose inflammation. Mechanistically, exercise induces the adipose expression of FGFR1 and KLB via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-mediated transcriptional activation. Thus, exercise sensitizes FGF21 actions in adipose tissues, which in turn sends humoral signals to coordinate multi-organ crosstalk for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.</p>

<p>Grafts and prosthetic materials used for the repair of bone defects are often accompanied by comorbidity and rejection. Therefore, there is an immense need for novel approaches to combating the issues surrounding such defects. Because of their accessibility, substantial proportion, and osteogenic differentiation potential, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) make for an ideal source of bone tissue in regenerative medicine. However, efficient induction of ASCs toward an osteoblastic lineage in vivo is met with challenges, and many signaling pathways must come together to secure osteoblastogenesis. Among them are bone morphogenic protein, wingless-related integration site protein, Notch, Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and extracellular regulated-signal kinase. The goal of this literature review is to conglomerate the present research on these pathways to formulate a better understanding of how ASCs are most effectively transformed into bone in the context of tissue engineering.</p>

<p>Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (hADSC) represent an attractive source of the cells for numerous therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine. These cells are also an efficient model to study biological pathways of stem cell action, tissue injury and disease. Like any other primary somatic cells in culture, industrial-scale expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) leads to the replicative exhaustion/senescence as defined by the “Hayflick limit.” The senescence is not only greatly effecting in vivo potency of the stem cell cultures but also might be the cause and the source of clinical inconsistency arising from infused cell preparations. In this light, the characterization of hADSC replicative and stressor-induced senescence phenotypes is of great interest.This chapter summarizes some of the essential protocols and assays used at our laboratories and clinic for the human fat procurement, isolation, culture, differentiation, and characterization of mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue and the stromal vascular fraction. Additionally, we provide manuals for characterization of hADSC senescence in a culture based on stem cells immunophenotype, proliferation rate, migration potential, and numerous other well-accepted markers of cellular senescence. Such methodological framework will be immensely helpful to design standards and surrogate measures for hADSC-based therapeutic applications.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on radiation-induced skin injury in SD rats.<U+2029> Methods: Radioactive particles 192Ir were used to irradiate the left medial thigh skin of SD rats, and the irradiation dose was at 90 Gy. Then, the rats were randomly allocated into a control group and a treatment group (each n=9). After the irradiation, the control group was injected with 60 µL PBS and the treatment group was injected with 60 µL ADSCs in irradiated skin. The progress of skin damage and healing was observed and photographed every day. Twenty-eighth days after the irradiation, the irradiated skin tissue was taken from the left thigh, and then fixed with formaldehyde fixative solution. At the same time, the skin tissue of the corresponding part of the normal group (n=9) that was not irradiated was also taken. After sampling, embedding and slicing, immunohistochemical staining was used to compare the levels of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), and HE staining was used to compare pathological features of the skin.<U+2029> Results: Radioactive particle 192Ir caused the development of III or IV radioactive skin damage. The score of the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group. The wounds of the treatment group were basically healed at 28 days, while the ulcer of the control group was unhealed. So, the healing time was shorter in the treatment group. The expression of a-SMA in the skin of the two groups was increased after the radiotherapy. By analyzing the pathological microstructure image, we found that the thickness of epidermis in the control group was greater than that in the treatment group, while the vascular density in the treatment group was greater than that in the control group (all P&lt;0.05).<U+2029> Conclusion: Radioactive particles 192Ir can cause skin damage, while the adipose-derived stem cells might alleviate radiation-induced skin injury and promote ulcer healing by promoting angiogenesis.</p>

<p>Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of angiogenesis and sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue remodeling during the development of obesity. Therefore, developing an easy and efficient method to document the dynamic changes in adipose tissue is necessary. Here, we describe a modified immunofluorescent approach that efficiently co-stains blood vessels and nerve fibers in adipose tissues. Compared to traditional and recently developed methods, our approach is relatively easy to follow and more efficient in labeling the blood vessels and nerve fibers with higher densities and less background. Moreover, the higher resolution of the images further allows us to accurately measure the area of the vessels, amount of branching, and length of the fibers by open source software. As a demonstration using our method, we show that brown adipose tissue (BAT) contains higher amounts of blood vessels and nerve fibers compared to white adipose tissue (WAT). We further find that among the WATs, subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) has more blood vessels and nerve fibers compared to epididymal WAT (eWAT). Our method thus provides a useful tool for investigating adipose tissue remodeling.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence suggests the vascular endothelium plays a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of obesity by regulating the functional status of white adipose and systemic metabolism. Robo4 is expressed specifically in endothelial cells and increases vascular stability and inhibits angiogenesis. We sought to determine the role of Robo4 in modulating cardiometabolic function in response to high-fat feeding.METHODS: We examined exercise capacity, glucose tolerance, and white adipose tissue artery gene expression, endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), and angiogenesis in wild type and Robo4 knockout (KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) or a high-fat diet (HFD).RESULTS: We found Robo4 deletion enhances exercise capacity in NC-fed mice and HFD markedly increased the expression of the Robo4 ligand, Slit2, in white adipose tissue. Deletion of Robo4 increased angiogenesis in white adipose tissue and protected against HFD-induced impairments in white adipose artery vasodilation and glucose intolerance.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a novel functional role for Robo4 in endothelial cell function and metabolic homeostasis in white adipose tissue, with Robo4 deletion protecting against endothelial and metabolic dysfunction associated with a HFD. Our findings suggest that Robo4-dependent signaling pathways may be a novel target in anti-obesity therapy.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) have multilineage differentiation potential, proangiogenic properties, and the ability to enhance vascularization in xenografted human ovarian tissue. The aim of the present study was to identify the mechanisms behind the proangiogenic effects of ASCs. For this purpose, severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were grafted with frozen-thawed human ovarian tissue. ASCs were labeled by lentiviral transfection for expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), and human ovarian tissue was grafted using a previously described two-step procedure. In the control group, ovarian tissue was transplanted using the standard one-step approach. Samples were collected and analyzed after 7 days. Detection of the eGFP antigen by immunofluorescence showed ASCs surrounding and infiltrating ovarian tissue grafts. Significantly higher vessel density was observed in the ASC group (P = 0.0182 versus control) on Day 7. Co-expression of eGFP, CD34 and CD31 was demonstrated in human vessels, confirming ASC differentiation into human endothelial cell lineages. Increased gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was also shown in the ASC group (P = 0.0182 versus control). Immunohistochemistry targeting anti-human VEGF revealed significantly higher expression levels in the ASC group (P = 0.033 versus control), while VEGF and eGFP immunofluorescence showed greater growth factor expression in areas surrounding ASCs. In conclusion, ASCs differentiate into human vessels and promote secretion of VEGF when transplanted together with human ovarian tissue to SCID mouse peritoneum using a two-step ovarian tissue grafting procedure. This is a promising step towards potentially improving ovarian tissue quality and lifespan. Long-term studies should be conducted to investigate ASC safety and efficacy in the context of ovarian tissue transplantation.</p>

<p>The prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome is reaching pandemic proportions worldwide, thus warranting an intensive search for novel preventive and treatment strategies. Recent studies have identified a number of soluble factors secreted by adipocytes and myocytes (adipo-/myokines), which link sedentary life style, abdominal obesity, and impairments in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In this review, we discuss the metabolic roles of the recently discovered myokine ß-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), which is produced by skeletal muscle during physical activity. In addition to physical activity, the circulating levels of BAIBA are controlled by the mitochondrial enzyme alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), which is primarily expressed in the liver and kidneys. Recent studies have shown that BAIBA can protect from diet-induced obesity in animal models. It induces transition of white adipose tissue to a “beige” phenotype, which induces fatty acids oxidation and increases insulin sensitivity. While the exact mechanisms of BAIBA-induced metabolic effects are still not well understood, we discuss some of the proposed pathways. The reviewed data provide new insights into the connection between physical activity and energy metabolism and suggest that BAIBA might be a potential novel drug for treatment of the metabolic syndrome and its cardiovascular complications.</p>

<p>AIMS: We investigated the effects of physical detraining on lipogenesis/lipolysis and cellularity (apoptosis/adipogenesis) in rat subcutaneous (inguinal; SC) and visceral (retroperitoneal; RP) white adipose depots.MAIN METHODS: Three groups of male Wistar rats (6-wk old) were studied: (1) (T) trained for 12<U+202F>weeks; (2) (D) trained for 8<U+202F>weeks and detrained for 4<U+202F>weeks; and (3) (S) age-matched sedentary. Training consisted of treadmill running sessions (1<U+202F>h/day, 5<U+202F>days/week, 50-60% maximal race capacity).KEY FINDINGS: Physical detraining increased glucose oxidation, lipogenesis, and adipocyte size in the SC and RP depots. The number of apoptotic SC adipocytes was reduced by 53% in the T (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.0001) and by 43% in the D (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001) as compared with S. RP adipocyte apoptosis in the T and D was 9.48% and 10.9% greater compared to the S, respectively (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). In the SC stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of D rats, adiponectin, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>), and Perilipin A mRNA expressions were more pronounced than S group, suggesting a more intense adipogenesis. This putative adipogenic effect was not observed in the RP depot. The physical detraining promoted rapid increase in the SC and RP depots however not through the same mechanisms.SIGNIFICANCE: Physical detraining induced fat cell hypertrophy (increase of lipogenesis) in both SC and RP whereas hyperplasia (increase of adipogenesis and reduction of apoptosis) was found in SC only. These results indicate the mechanism associated with obesogenic effects of detraining varies with the fat depot.</p>

<p>Obesity results in the chronic activation of innate immune system and subsequently sets in diabetes. Aim of the study was to investigate the immunometabolic role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the obesity. We performed both BAT transplantation as well as extirpation experiments in the mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We carried out immune cell profiling in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). BAT transplantation reversed HFD-induced increase in body weight gain and insulin resistance without altering diet intake. Importantly, BAT transplantation attenuated the obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in terms of decreased pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages, cytotoxic CD8a T-cells and restored anti-inflammatory regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the eWAT. BAT transplantation also improved endogenous BAT activity by elevating protein expression of browning markers (UCP-1, PRDM16 and PGC1a) in it. In addition, BAT transplantation promoted the eWAT expression of various genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (such as Elvol3 and Tfam,). In contrast, extirpation of the interscapular BAT exacerbated HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation (by increasing M1 macrophages, CD8a T-cell and decreasing Tregs in eWAT). Taken together, our results suggested an important role of BAT in combating obesity-associated metabolic complications. These results open a novel therapeutic option to target obesity and related metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Bone is a vascularized tissue that is comprised of collagen fibers and calcium phosphate crystals such as hydroxyapatite (HAp) and whitlockite (WH). HAp and WH are known to elicit bone regeneration by stimulating osteoblast activities and osteogenic commitment of stem cells. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is shown to promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis which is considered as an essential process in bone repair by providing nutrients. In this study, VEGF-secreting human adipose-derived stem cells (VEGF-ADSCs) are developed by transducing ADSCs with VEGF-encoded lentivirus. Additionally, WH-reinforced gelatin/heparin cryogels (WH-C) are fabricated by loading WH into gelatin/heparin cryogels. VEGF-ADSC secrete tenfold more VEGF than ADSC and show increased VEGF secretion with cell growth. Also, incorporation of WH into cryogels provides a mineralized environment with ions secreted from WH. When the VEGF-ADSCs are seeded on WH-C, sustained release of VEGF is observed due to the specific affinity of VEGF to heparin. Finally, the synergistic effect of VEGF-ADSC and WH on osteogenesis is successfully confirmed by alkaline phosphatase and real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. In vivo bone formation is demonstrated via implantation of VEGF-ADSC seeded WH-C into mouse calvarial bone defect model, resulted in enhanced bone development with the highest bone volume/total volume.</p>

Significant improvements in reliability have been made in the last 2 decades and there is a large body of literature pertaining to extraction, processing and injection methods to obtain more lasting effects. However, volume loss and graft resorption remain a major challenge in the long term and lead to unpredictability in results. Enriching adipose graft with stromal vascular fraction, ex vivo cultured adipose stem cells and platelet-derived growth factor among others is one method under active investigation which may assist graft survival through a range of mechanisms including increased angiogenesis. Breaking adipose graft into smaller fragments such that engrafted cells have greater access to donor-site oxygenation and nutrition is another method which in theory may promote survival. Presently, adipose grafting in the face is usually for the addition of volume to fill defects. However, the stem-cell containing fraction of adipose grafting (stromal vascular fraction) appears to exert a rejuvenating effect on overlying skin and soft tissue when administered alone. The application of these low-volume injections represents a significant shift in thinking away from mere volume expansion. These techniques have been tested in a range of animal models and some human studies. In this review, the authors provide a broad overview of present research and highlight both limitations in previous research and current areas of investigation.</p>

<p>Vascular tissue engineering of the middle layer of natural arteries requires contractile smooth muscle cells (SMC) which can be differentiated from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) by treatment with transforming growth factor-ß, sphingosylphosphorylcholine and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (TSB). Since mechanical stimulation may support or replace TSB-driven differentiation, we investigated its effect plus TSB-treatment on SMC orientation and contractile protein expression. Tubular fibrin scaffolds with incorporated ASC or pre-differentiated SMC were exposed to pulsatile perfusion for 10 days with or without TSB. Statically incubated scaffolds served as controls. Pulsatile incubation resulted in collagen-I expression and orientation of either cell type circumferentially around the lumen as shown by alpha smooth muscle actin (aSMA), calponin and smoothelin staining as early, intermediate and late marker proteins. Semi-quantitative Westernblot analyses revealed strongly increased aSMA and calponin expression by either pulsatile (12.48-fold; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01 and 38.15-fold; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.07) or static incubation plus TSB pre-treatment (8.91-fold; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05 and 37.69-fold; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). In contrast, contractility and smoothelin expression required both mechanical and TSB stimulation since it was 2.57-fold increased (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) only by combining pulsatile perfusion and TSB. Moreover, pre-differentiation of ASC prior to pulsatile perfusion was not necessary since it could not further increase the expression level of any marker.</p>

<p>Thermogenic adipocytes burn nutrients in order to produce heat. Upon activation, brown adipose tissue (BAT) clears vast amounts of lipids and glucose from the circulation and thus substantially lowers plasma lipid levels. As a consequence, BAT activation protects from the development of atherosclerosis. However, it is unclear if pharmacologic activation of BAT can be exploited therapeutically to reduce plaque burden in established atherosclerotic disease. Here we study the impact of thermogenic adipose tissues on plaque regression in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Thermogenic adipocytes in atherosclerotic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice were pharmacologically activated by dietary CL316,243 (CL) treatment for 4 weeks and the outcomes on metabolically active tissues, plasma lipids and atherosclerosis were analyzed. While the chronic activation of thermogenic adipocytes reduced adiposity, increased browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), altered liver gene expression, and reduced plasma triglyceride levels, atherosclerotic plaque burden remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that despite improving adiposity and plasma triglycerides, pharmacologic activation of thermogenic adipocytes is not able to reverse atherosclerosis in LDLR-deficient mice.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have shown effectiveness in treating diabetic bladder dysfunction (DBD). In the present study, ADSCs pretreated by defocused low-energy shock wave (DLSW) were first used to achieve better therapeutic effect. ADSCs were treated by DLSW prior to each passage. Secretions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were tested. Proliferation ability was examined by staining 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) and assessing expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki67. DBD rat model was created and subgrouped via therapeutic options of phosphate-buffered saline, ADSCs, pretreated ADSCs, and ADSCs lysate. Afterward, voiding functions were evaluated, and tissues were examined by histology. Neonatal rats received intraperitoneal injection of EdU. All rats were subgrouped and treated as narrated above. Bladder tissues were stained with EdU, Stro-1, and CD34. Results showed that shocked ADSCs were activated by secreting more VEGF and NGF, by higher EdU-retaining cells ratios, and by higher expressions of PCNA and Ki67 compared with unshocked ADSCs. Shocked ADSCs had the most effective efficacy in treating DBD by secreting the most VEGF and NGF to accelerate regenerations of revascularization and innervation. Migrations of EdU<sup>+</sup> Stro-1<sup>+</sup> CD34<sup>-</sup> endogenous stem cells to bladders were enhanced by injecting ADSCs. In conclusion, ADSCs pretreated by DLSW had potent therapeutic effect in treating DBD by secreting VEGF and NGF. Recruitment of endogenous stem cells was considered as an important mechanism in this regenerative process.</p>

<p>Angiotensin II plays important functions in cardiovascular system mediating actions leading to inflammatory responses such as activation of VSMC in order to produce ROS, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Changes in angiotensin II production could stimulate the recruitment and activation of myeloid cells initiating local inflammatory response without effect on BP. We aimed to verify if angiotensin II induces an inflammatory response in the aorta and if it correlates with variations in BP. C57Bl/6 mice treated with saline solution (0.9%, control group) or angiotensin II (30ng/kg, Ang II group) were used. BP and HR levels were measured. Immunohistochemistry for IL1-<i>ß</i>, TGF-<i>ß</i>, iNOS, CD45, and <i>a</i>-actin was performed in the aorta. BP and HR do not change. A biphasic response was observed both for IL1-<i>ß</i> and TGF-<i>ß</i> expression and also for the presence of CD45 positive cells, with an acute increase (between 30 and 60 minutes) and a second increase, between 24 and 48 hours. Positive staining for iNOS increased in the earlier period (30 minutes) in perivascular adipose tissue and in a longer period (48 hours) in tunica adventitia. Immunoblotting to <i>a</i>-actin showed no alterations, suggesting that the applied dose of angiotensin II does not alter the aortic VSMCs phenotype. The results suggest that angiotensin II, even at doses that do not alter BP, induces the expression of inflammatory markers and migration of inflammatory cells into the aorta of normotensive mice. Thus, angiotensin II may increase the propensity to develop a cardiovascular injury, even in normotensive individuals.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: A positive energy balance is considered to be the primary cause of the development of obesity-related diseases. Treatment often consists of a combination of reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure. Here we use an existing computational modelling framework describing the long-term development of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in APOE3L.CETP mice fed a high-fat diet containing cholesterol with a human-like metabolic system. This model was used to analyze energy expenditure and energy balance in a large set of individual model realizations.RESULTS: We developed and applied a strategy to select specific individual models for a detailed analysis of heterogeneity in energy metabolism. Models were stratified based on energy expenditure. A substantial surplus of energy was found to be present during MetS development, which explains the weight gain during MetS development. In the majority of the models, energy was mainly expended in the peripheral tissues, but also distinctly different subgroups were identified. In silico perturbation of the system to induce increased peripheral energy expenditure implied changes in lipid metabolism, but not in carbohydrate metabolism. In silico analysis provided predictions for which individual models increase of peripheral energy expenditure would be an effective treatment.CONCLUSION: The computational analysis confirmed that the energy imbalance plays an important role in the development of obesity. Furthermore, the model is capable to predict whether an increase in peripheral energy expenditure - for instance by cold exposure to activate brown adipose tissue (BAT) - could resolve MetS symptoms.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: The toxic effects of mercury (Hg) are involved in homeostasis of energy systems such as lipid and glucose metabolism, and white adipose tissue dysfunction is considered as a central mechanism leading to metabolic disorders.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic inorganic Hg exposure at low doses on the lipid and glycemic metabolism.RESULTS: Hg exposure reduced the absolute and relative eWAT weights, adipocyte size, plasma insulin levels, glucose tolerance, antioxidant defenses and increased plasma glucose and triglyceride levels. In addition, CHOP, GRP78, PPARa, PPAR<U+03B3>, leptin and adiponectin mRNA expressions were increased in Hg-treated animals. No differences in Hg concentration were found in eWAT between the untreated and Hg groups. These results suggest that the reduction in adipocyte size is related to the impaired antioxidant defenses, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the disrupted PPARs and adipokines mRNA expression induced by the metal in eWAT. These disturbances possibly induced a decrease in circulating insulin levels, an imbalance between lipolysis and lipogenesis mechanisms in eWAT, with an increase in fatty acids mobilization, a reduction in glucose uptake and an activation of pro-apoptotic pathways, leading to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.CONCLUSIONS: Hg is a powerful environmental WAT disruptor that influences signaling events and impairs metabolic activity and hormonal balance of adipocytes.</p>

<p>Systemic sclerosis is a multiorgan autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and tissue fibrosis of unknown etiology. Recently, adipokines (cell signaling proteins secreted by adipose tissue) have attracted much attention as a cytokine family contributing to the various pathological processes of systemic sclerosis. Adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, adipsin, visfatin or chemerin are a heterogenic group of molecules. Adiponectin exhibits anti-fibrotic features and affects inflammatory reactions. Leptin promotes fibrosis and inflammation. Resistin was linked to vascular involvement in systemic sclerosis. Visfatin was associated with regression of skin lesions in late-stage systemic sclerosis. Chemerin appears as a marker of increased risk of impaired renal function and development of skin sclerosis in the early stage of systemic sclerosis. Vaspin was indicated to have a protective role in digital ulcers development. Novel adipokines-adipsin, apelin, omentin and CTRP-3-are emerging as molecules potentially involved in SSc pathogenesis. Serum adipokine levels may be used as predictive and diagnostic factors in systemic sclerosis. However, further investigations are required to establish firm correlations between distinct adipokines and systemic sclerosis.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) from livestock are valuable resources for animal reproduction and veterinary therapeutics. Previous studies have shown that hypoxic conditions were beneficial in maintaining the physiological activities of ASCs. However, the effects of hypoxia on buffalo ASCs (bASCs) remain unclear. In this study, the effects of hypoxia on proliferation, stemness, and reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of bASCs were examined. The results showed that the hypoxic culture conditions (5% oxygen) enhanced the proliferation and colony formation of bASCs. The expression levels of proliferation-related genes, and secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly enhanced in hypoxia. Hypoxic culture conditions activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), thereby contributing to the secretion of bFGF and VEGF, which in turn enhanced the expression of HIF-1a and promoted the proliferation of bASCs. Furthermore, in hypoxic culture conditions, bASCs exhibited the main characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells, and the expression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4, NANOG, C-MYC, and the differentiation capacity of bASCs were significantly enhanced. Finally, bASCs were more efficiently and easily reprogrammed into iPSCs in hypoxic culture conditions and these iPSCs exhibited some characteristics of naïve pluripotent stem cells. These findings provide the theoretical guidance for elucidating the detailed mechanism of hypoxia on physiological activities of bASCs including proliferation, stemness maintenance, and reprogramming.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and its vasomodulatory effects play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of blood vessels. Alterations in PVAT associated with reduction in its anticontractile influence are proven to contribute to vascular dysfunction in hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine whether the changes in PVAT properties could participate in progression of vascular abnormalities in developing spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR, both in 5th and in 12th week of age, were used. Systolic blood pressure was similar between WKY rats and SHR in 5th week of age; however, in 12th week, it was significantly increased in SHR comparing to WKY rats. The amount of retroperitoneal fat was higher in WKY rats in both age groups, whereas body weight was higher in WKY rats only in 12th week, when compared to age-matched SHR. From isolated superior mesenteric arteries, two ring preparations were prepared for isometric tension recording, one with PVAT intact and other with PVAT removed. In WKY rats as well as in SHR, arterial contractile responses to noradrenaline, applied cumulatively on rings, were significantly inhibited in the presence of intact PVAT. In both age groups, anticontractile effect of PVAT was higher in WKY rats than in SHR. Neurogenic contractions, induced by electrical stimulation of perivascular sympathoadrenergic nerves, were significantly attenuated in the presence of PVAT in WKY mesenteric arteries from both age groups; however, in arteries from SHR, intact PVAT had no influence on this type of contractile responses. The results suggest that in SHR impairment of anticontractile effect of PVAT precedes hypertension and might contribute to its development.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVEStem cell therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of severe cerebral ischemia. However, targeting sufficient grafted cells to the affected area remains challenging. Choosing an adequate transplantation method for the CNS appears crucial for this therapy to become a clinical reality. The authors used a scaffold-free cell sheet as a translational intervention. This method involves the use of cell sheet layers and allows the transplantation of a large number of cells, locally and noninvasively. The authors evaluated the effectiveness of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell sheets in a rat model of stroke.METHODSThe animals, subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, were randomly divided in two groups: one in which a cell sheet was transplanted and the other in which a vehicle was used (n = 10/group). Over a period of 14 days after transplantation, the animals’ behavior was evaluated, after which brain tissue samples were removed and fixed, and the extent of angiogenesis and infarct areas was evaluated histologically.RESULTSCompared to the vehicle group, in the cell sheet group functional angiogenesis and neurogenesis were significantly increased, which resulted in behavioral improvement. Transplanted cells were identified within newly formed perivascular walls as pericytes, a proportion of which were functional. Newly formed blood vessels were found within the cell sheet that had anastomosed to the cerebral blood vessels in the host.CONCLUSIONSThe transplantation approach described here is expected to provide not only a paracrine effect but also a direct cell effect resulting in cell replacement that protects the damaged neurovascular unit. The behavioral improvement seen with this transplantation approach provides the basis for further research on cell sheet-based regenerative treatment as a translational treatment for patients with stroke.</p>

<h4>Role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</h4>

<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its complications are an expanding health problem associated with the metabolic syndrome. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly specialized endothelial cells localized at the interface between the blood derived from the gut and the adipose tissue on the one side, and other liver cells on the other side. In physiological conditions, LSECs are gatekeepers of liver homeostasis. LSECs display anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic properties by preventing Kupffer cell and hepatic stellate cell activation and regulating intrahepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure. This review focusses on changes occurring in LSECs in NAFLD and on their consequences on NAFLD progression and complications. Capillarization, namely the loss of LSEC fenestrae, and LSEC dysfunction, namely the loss of the ability of LSECs to generate vasodilator agents in response to increased shear stress both occur early in NAFLD. These LSEC changes favour steatosis development and set the stage for NAFLD progression. At the stage of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, altered LSECs release inflammatory mediators and contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, thus promoting liver injury and inflammation. Altered LSECs also fail to maintain hepatic stellate cell quiescence and release fibrogenic mediators, including Hedgehog signalling molecules, promoting liver fibrosis. Liver angiogenesis is increased in NAFLD and contributes to liver inflammation and fibrosis, but also to hepatocellular carcinoma development. Thus, improving LSEC health appears to be a promising approach to prevent NAFLD progression and complications.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are at risk of overweight and obesity, two major health problems, though underweight can be a negative prognostic factor too. Awareness of the body mass index (BMI) in ACHD is very limited. The present study describes the use and prevalence of BMI in Italian symptomatic hospitalized ACHD patients in relation to complexity by Bethesda system classification, diagnosis, sex and age.METHODS AND RESULTS: We classified 1388 ACHD patients, aged 18-69 years, on the basis of their BMI, and compared them to the Italian reference population. In our total ACHD population we found a significantly higher prevalence of underweight compared to the Italian reference population (6.34% vs 3.20%). ACHD women were more underweight than men. Underweight decreased with age. Overweight was significantly less frequent in the total ACHD population (26.73% compared to 31.70%) in the Italian reference population. Men were more likely to be overweight than women. In statistical terms obesity was similar in the Italian reference population (10.50%) and our ACHD population (9.58%). Both overweight and obesity increased with age. Results were comparable using a diagnostic anatomical-functional classification and the Bethesda system classification.CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of ACHD the prevalence of underweight was double that of the Italian reference population. The prevalence of overweight was lower, while obesity was similar. Since BMI does not account for differences in body fat distribution, a future aim will be to quantify the visceral component of the adipose tissue in ACHD patients and examine their body composition in order to reflect their risk of acquired cardiovascular disease better, and either to maintain or achieve an adequate visceral component.</p>

<p>The prerequisite for a successful clinical use of autologous adipose-tissue-derived cells is the highest possible regenerative potential of the applied cell population, the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Current isolation methods depend on high enzyme concentration, lysis buffer, long incubation steps and mechanical stress, resulting in single cell dissociation. The aim of the study was to limit cell manipulation and obtain a derivative comprising therapeutic cells (microtissue-SVF) without dissociation from their natural extracellular matrix, by employing a gentle good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade isolation. The microtissue-SVF yielded larger numbers of viable cells as compared to the improved standard-SVF, both with low enzyme concentration and minimal dead cell content. It comprised stromal tissue compounds (collagen, glycosaminoglycans, fibroblasts), capillaries and vessel structures (CD31+, smooth muscle actin+). A broad range of cell types was identified by surface-marker characterisation, including mesenchymal, haematopoietic, pericytic, blood and lymphatic vascular and epithelial cells. Subpopulations such as supra-adventitial adipose-derived stromal/stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells were significantly more abundant in the microtissue-SVF, corroborated by significantly higher potency for angiogenic tube-like structure formation in vitro. The microtissue-SVF showed the characteristic phenotype and tri-lineage mesenchymal differentiation potential in vitro and an immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic secretome. In vivo implantation of the microtissue-SVF combined with fat demonstrated successful graft integration in nude mice. The present study demonstrated a fast and gentle isolation by minor manipulation of liposuction material, achieving a therapeutically relevant cell population with high vascularisation potential and immunomodulatory properties still embedded in a fraction of its original matrix.</p>

<p>Pulmonary hypertension is an umbrella term including many different disorders causing an increase of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) = 25 mmHg. Recent data revealed a strong association between obesity and pulmonary hypertension. Adiponectin is a protein synthetized by the adipose tissue with pleiotropic effects on inflammation and cell proliferation, with a potential protective role on the pulmonary vasculature. Both in vivo and in vitro studies documented that adiponectin is an endogenous modulator of NO production and interferes with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-<U+03BA>ß) signaling preventing endothelial dysfunction and proliferation. Furthermore, adiponectin ameliorates insulin resistance by mediating the biological effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>). Therefore, adiponectin modulation emerged as a theoretical target for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, currently under investigation. Recently, consistent data showed that hypoglycemic agents targeting PPAR<U+03B3> as well as renin<U+207B>angiotensin system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers may influence pulmonary hemodynamics in different models of pulmonary hypertension.</p>

<p>Using cell-based engineered skin is an emerging strategy for treating difficult-to-heal wounds. To date, much endeavor has been devoted to the fabrication of appropriate scaffolds with suitable biomechanical properties to support cell viability and growth in the microenvironment of a wound. The aim of this research was to assess the impact of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) and keratinocytes on gelatin/chitosan/ß-glycerol phosphate (GCGP) nanoscaffold in full-thickness excisional skin wound healing of rats. For this purpose, AD-MSCs and keratinocytes were isolated from rats and GCGP nanoscaffolds were electrospun. Through an in vivo study, the percentage of wound closure was assessed on days 7, 14, and 21 after wound induction. Samples were taken from the wound sites in order to evaluate the density of collagen fibers and vessels at 7 and 14 days. Moreover, sampling was done on days 7 and 14 from wound sites to assess the density of collagen fibers and vessels. The wound closure rate was significantly increased in the keratinocytes-AD-MSCs-scaffold (KMS) group compared with other groups. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor, collagen type 1, and CD34 were also significantly higher in the KMS group compared with the other groups. These results suggest that the combination of AD-MSCs and keratinocytes seeded onto GCGP nanoscaffold provides a promising treatment for wound healing.</p>

<p>AIM: The visceral adiposity index (VAI) has been proposed as an estimate of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and as an indicator of VAT dysfunction. Both parameters are associated with cardiometabolic risk, including insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated whether VAI is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in subjects who were free of cardiovascular disease but were at risk of developing diabetes mellitus.METHODS: A total of 731 adults with a median age of 47 years old without diabetes mellitus were included in this cross-sectional study. The anthropometric data, blood pressure, and lipid profiles of 398 women and 333 men were measured. All subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was evaluated by ultrasound. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).CONCLUSION: The calculation of VAI may provide a better estimation of subclinical atherosclerosis than the calculation of HOMA-IR.</p>

<p>This study was designed to investigate the potential effects and underlying mechanism of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on allergic inflammation compared to Montelukast as an antileukotriene drug in a rat model of allergic rhinitis (AR). The effect of MSCs was evaluated in albino rats that were randomly divided into four (control, AR, AR + Montelukast, and AR + MSCs) groups. Rats of AR group were sensitized by ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged with daily nasal drops of OVA diluted in sterile physiological saline (50 µL/nostril, 100 mg/mL, 10% OVA) from day 15 to day 21 of treatment with/without Montelukast (1 h before each challenge) or MSCs I/P injection (1 × 106 MCSs; weekly for three constitutive weeks). Both Montelukast and MSCs treatment started from day 15 of the experiment. At the end of the 5th week, blood samples were collected from all rats for immunological assays, histological, and molecular biology examinations. Both oral Montelukast and intraperitoneal injection of MSCs significantly reduced allergic symptoms and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), IgG1, IgG2a and histamine as well as increasing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Further analysis revealed that induction of nasal innate cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and TNF-a; and chemokines, such as CCL11 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), were suppressed; and transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) was up-regulated in Montelukast and MSCs-treated groups with superior effect to MSCs, which explained their underlying mechanism. In addition, the adipose tissue-derived MSCs-treated group had more restoring effects on nasal mucosa structure demonstrated by electron microscopical examination.</p>

<p>Fat grafting procedures are considered to be a promising regenerative, cell-directed therapy; however, their survival is mainly influenced by ischemia condition. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), as an intermediate in energy metabolism, has the potential to rescue cells and tissues from hypoxic-ischemic circumstances. In the present study, human lipoaspirates were grafted subcutaneously into nude mice followed by a daily intraperitoneal injection of FBP at different doses for 7 days. Next, the grafts were harvested at different time points till 12 weeks postimplantation and were evaluated for cell viability and function, tissue revascularization and inflammatory cell infiltration using histological analysis, whole-mount living tissue imaging, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity assays, and quantitative analysis of gene expression. The results demonstrated that exogenous FBP administration could attenuate the volume and weight reduction of fat graft; meanwhile, FBP enhanced adipocyte viability and function, increased blood vessel formation, and decreased inflammation. Moreover, in vitro cell experiments showed that FBP could promote adipose-derived stem cell viability and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression in ischemia conditions. Our study indicates that FBP can be used as a protective agent for fat grafting and may be applied in stem cell-based regenerative medicine. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2019;8:606-616.</p>

<p>Body-fat distribution is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular health consequences. We analyzed the association of body-fat distribution, assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, with 228,985 predicted coding and splice site variants available on exome arrays in up to 344,369 individuals from five major ancestries (discovery) and 132,177 European-ancestry individuals (validation). We identified 15 common (minor allele frequency, MAF =5%) and nine low-frequency or rare (MAF &lt;5%) coding novel variants. Pathway/gene set enrichment analyses identified lipid particle, adiponectin, abnormal white adipose tissue physiology and bone development and morphology as important contributors to fat distribution, while cross-trait associations highlight cardiometabolic traits. In functional follow-up analyses, specifically in Drosophila RNAi-knockdowns, we observed a significant increase in the total body triglyceride levels for two genes (DNAH10 and PLXND1). We implicate novel genes in fat distribution, stressing the importance of interrogating low-frequency and protein-coding variants.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: The cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions that regulate adipose tissue homeostasis are incompletely understood. Proteoglycans (PGs) and their sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) provide spatial and temporal signals for ECM organization and interactions with resident cells by impacting growth factor and cytokine activity. Therefore, PGs and their GAGs could be significant to adipose tissue homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of ECM sulfated GAGs in adipose tissue homeostasis.METHODS: Adipose tissue and metabolic homeostasis in mice deficient in xylosyltransferase 2 (Xylt2-/-) were examined by histologic analyses, gene expression analyses, whole body fat composition measurements, and glucose tolerance test. Adipose tissue inflammation and adipocyte precursors were characterized by flow cytometry and in vitro culture of mesenchymal stem cells.RESULTS: Xylt2-/- mice have low body weight due to overall reductions in abdominal fat deposition. Histologically, the adipocytes are reduced in size and number in both gonadal and mesenteric fat depots of Xylt2-/- mice. In addition, these mice are glucose intolerant, insulin resistant, and have increased serum triglycerides as compared to Xylt2<U+2009>+<U+2009>/<U+2009>+<U+2009>control mice. Furthermore, the adipose tissue niche has increased inflammatory cells and enrichment of proinflammatory factors IL6 and IL1ß, and these mice also have a loss of adipose tissue vascular endothelial cells. Lastly, xylosyltransferease-2 (XylT2) deficient mesenchymal stem cells from gonadal adipose tissue and bone marrow exhibit impaired adipogenic differentiation in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased GAGs due to the loss of the key GAG assembly enzyme XylT2 causes reduced steady state adipose tissue stores leading to a unique lipodystrophic model. Accumulation of an adipocytic precursor pool of cells is discovered indicating an interruption in differentiation. Therefore, adipose tissue GAGs are important in the homeostasis of adipose tissue by mediating control of adipose precursor development, tissue inflammation, and vascular development.</p>

<p>Endocannabinoids are a group of arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators binding to cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular inflammation, leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as macrophage properties in these organs. This suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system in the vasculature and peripheral organs might have a therapeutic potential for atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular inflammation and improving metabolic risk factors. This review will provide a brief update on the effects of endocannabinoid signalling in atherosclerosis and related metabolic complications.</p>

<p>Hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare stromal tumor composed of variable admixtures of thick-walled vessels, smooth muscles and adipose tissue. One of the specific radiological findings of hepatic AML is an early drainage vein noted via enhanced computed tomography (CT). We report a case of hepatic AML showing early drainage veins into both the hepatic and portal vein. The case involved a 46-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital because of a giant hepatic tumor. CT revealed well-enhanced 14 cm and 1 cm tumors in the left and right lobes, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the existence of adipose tissues in the larger tumor. Hepatic arteriography revealed early drainage veins draining into both the hepatic and portal vein. Based on a diagnosis of hepatic AML, left hepatectomy and partial hepatectomy were performed. Pathology revealed both tumors as hepatic AML based on human melanoma black-45 immuno-positivity. Hepatic AML with early drainage veins into both the hepatic and portal vein is rare. The dilated and retrogressive vein drains the abundant arterial blood flow of the tumor. The finding of early drainage veins into not only the hepatic vein but also the portal vein should be helpful for diagnosing hepatic AMLs.</p>

<p>NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Do circulating factors mediate exercise-induced effects on adipose tissue GLUT4 expression? What is the main finding and its importance? Serum (10%) obtained from human volunteers immediately after a single exercise bout increased GLUT4 protein levels in human adipocytes in culture. This result suggests that circulating factors might mediate the effects of exercise on adipose tissue GLUT4 and prompts further effort to identify the specific factor(s) and tissue(s) of origin.ABSTRACT: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that circulating factors generated during exercise increase adipose tissue GLUT4 expression. Serum was obtained from eight healthy subjects before and after 60 min of cycling exercise, and primary adipocytes were cultured from stromal vascular fractions that were isolated from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue samples from one healthy, male volunteer. A 48 h exposure of human primary adipocytes to 10% serum obtained after exercise increased GLUT4 protein expression, on average, by 12% compared with exposure to 10% serum obtained at rest, before exercise. GLUT4 mRNA levels were increased after 12 h of exposure to exercise serum but were unchanged after 6 and 24 h of exposure. Our results suggest that circulating factors might mediate the effects of exercise on adipose tissue GLUT4 expression and encourage further efforts to identify the potential factor(s), tissue(s) of origin and physiological relevance.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is no longer recognised as simply a structural support for the vasculature, and we now know that PVAT releases vasoactive factors which modulate vascular function. Since the discovery of this function in 1991, PVAT research is rapidly growing and the importance of PVAT function in disease is becoming increasingly clear. Obesity is associated with a plethora of vascular conditions; therefore, the study of adipocytes and their effects on the vasculature is vital. PVAT contains an adrenergic system including nerves, adrenoceptors and transporters. In obesity, the autonomic nervous system is dysfunctional; therefore, sympathetic innervation of PVAT may be the key mechanistic link between increased adiposity and vascular disease. In addition, not all obese people develop vascular disease, but a common feature amongst those that do appears to be the inflammatory cell population in PVAT. This review will discuss what is known about sympathetic innervation of PVAT, and the links between nerve activation and inflammation in obesity. In addition, we will examine the therapeutic potential of exercise in sympathetic stimulation of adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Vascularization is a major hurdle in complex tissue and organ engineering. Tissues greater than 200 µm in diameter cannot rely on simple diffusion to obtain nutrients and remove waste. Therefore, an integrated vascular network is required for clinical translation of engineered tissues. Microvessels have been described as &lt;150 µm in diameter, but clinically they are defined as &lt;1 mm. With new advances in super microsurgery, vessels less than 1 mm can be anastomosed to the recipient circulation. However, this technical advancement still relies on the creation of a stable engineered microcirculation that is amenable to surgical manipulation and is readily perfusable. Microvascular engineering lays on the crossroads of microfabrication, microfluidics, and tissue engineering strategies that utilize various cellular constituents. Early research focused on vascularization by co-culture and cellular interactions, with the addition of angiogenic growth factors to promote vascular growth. Since then, multiple strategies have been utilized taking advantage of innovations in additive manufacturing, biomaterials, and cell biology. However, the anatomy and dynamics of native blood vessels has not been consistently replicated. Inconsistent results can be partially attributed to cell sourcing which remains an enigma for microvascular engineering. Variations of endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and stem cells have all been used for microvascular network fabrication along with various mural cells. As each source offers advantages and disadvantages, there continues to be a lack of consensus. Furthermore, discord may be attributed to incomplete understanding about cell isolation and characterization without considering the microvascular architecture of the desired tissue/organ.</p>

<p>Problems in breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps include postoperative fat induration and necrosis. A resulting clinical symptom is palpable indurated tissue, but it is difficult to measure the stiffness of transplanted fat tissues objectively at a deep site. The ability to perform shear-wave elastography (SWE) was recently added to some common ultrasonic echo devices, enabling objective three-dimensional measurements of tissue stiffness. In this study, we measured the stiffness of transplanted DIEP flaps using SWE to examine the effects of measurement sites, flap size and perforator patterns on stiffness. The subjects were 26 patients who showed induration of a transplanted flap on palpation in follow-up observation performed more than 6<U+2009>months after breast reconstruction with a DIEP flap. The effects of the weight of the transplanted flap, and the diameter, number and location of the perforators on the stiffness of fat tissue were also analyzed. Within each zone, distal regions showed higher values, but in Zone II, significantly higher stiffness was also found in the proximal region. Multivariate regression analysis including all measurement sites, the weight of transplanted flap, and diameter, number and location of perforators showed that the stiffness of fat tissue was significantly higher in subjects with a larger weight flap. For safe reconstruction, it will be useful to examine the stiffness of fat tissue in individual regions of a transplanted flap retrospectively, because the examination results can be used in actual clinical practice.</p>

<p>To evaluate iterative metal artifact reduction (iMAR) technique in images data of hip prosthesis on computed tomography (CT) and the added value of advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) compared with standard filtered back projection (FBP).Twenty-eight patients addressed to CT examinations for hip prosthesis were included prospectively. Images were reconstructed with iMAR algorithm in addition to FBP and ADMIRE techniques. Measuring image noise assessed objective image quality and attenuation values with standardized region of interest (ROI) in 4 predefined anatomical structures (gluteus medius and rectus femoris muscles, inferior and anterior abdominal fat, and femoral vessels when contrast media was present). Subjective image quality was graded on a 5-point Likert scale, taking into account the size of artifacts, the metal-bone interface and the conspicuity of pelvic organs, and the diagnostic confidence.Improvement in overall image quality was statistically significant using iMAR (P&lt;.001) compared with ADMIRE and FBP. ADMIRE did not show any impact in image noise, attenuation value, or global quality image. iMAR showed a significant decrease in image noise in all ROIs (Hounsfield Unit) as compared with FBP and ADMIRE. Interobserver agreement was high in all reconstructions (FBP, FBP+iMAR, ADMIRE, and ADMIRE + iMAR) more than 0.8. iMAR reconstructions showed emergence of new artifacts in bone-metal interface.iMAR algorithm allows a significant reduction of metal artifacts on CT images with unilateral or bilateral prostheses without additional value of ADMIRE. It improves the analysis of surrounding tissue but potentially generates new artifacts in bone-metal interface.</p>

We generated mice with global inducible post-natal inactivation or adipose-specific loss of the Enpp2 gene encoding ATX. The animals are phenotypically unremarkable and exhibit differences in adipocyte size and adipose tissue expression of inflammatory genes after high fat feeding without gross differences in fat distribution or body mass. Surprisingly, both models of Enpp2- deficiency exhibited marked protection from high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. This phenotype was not associated with differences in dietary fat absorption but may be accounted for by differences in hepatic expression of genes involved in de novo synthesis of triglycerides. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ATX might be protective against hepatic steatosis.</p>

<p>Chronic low-grade inflammation in visceral adipose tissues triggers the development of obesity-related insulin resistance, leading to the metabolic syndrome, a serious health condition with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke. In the present study, we investigated whether Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing protein 2 (Spred2), a negative regulator of the Ras/Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway, plays a role in the development of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, adipose tissue inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, and insulin resistance. Spred2 knockout (KO) mice, fed with HFD, exhibited an augmented body weight gain, which was associated with enhanced adipocyte hypertrophy in mesenteric white adipose tissue (mWAT) and deteriorated dyslipidemia, compared with wild-type (WT) controls. The number of infiltrating macrophages with a M1 phenotype, and the crown-like structures, composed of macrophages surrounding dead or dying adipocytes, were more abundant in Spred2 KO-mWAT compared to in WT-mWAT. Exacerbated adipose tissue inflammation in Spred2 KO mice led to aggravated insulin resistance and fatty liver disease. To analyze the mechanism(s) that caused adipose tissue inflammation, cytokine response in mWAT was investigated. Stromal vascular fraction that contained macrophages from Spred2 KO-mWAT showed elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) compared with those from WT-mWAT. Upon stimulation with palmitate acid (PA), bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) derived from Spred2 KO mice secreted higher levels of TNFa and MCP-1 than those from WT mice with enhanced ERK activation. U0126, a MEK inhibitor, reduced the PA-induced cytokine response. Taken together, these results suggested that Spred2, in macrophages, negatively regulates high fat diet-induced obesity, adipose tissue inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, and insulin resistance by inhibiting the ERK/MAPK pathway. Thus, Spred2 represents a potential therapeutic tool for the prevention of insulin resistance and resultant metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: We previously reported that co-transplantation of exosomes from hypoxia-preconditioned adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) improves the neoangiogenesis and survival of the grafted tissue. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of this protective effect.METHODS: Exosomes were collected from normoxia-treated (nADSC-Exo) or hypoxia–treated (hypADSC-Exo) human ADSCs, and their pro-angiogenic capacity was evaluated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a nude mouse model of subcutaneous fat grafting. Protein array was used to compare the exosome-derived proteins between nADSC-Exo and hypADSC-Exo.RESULTS: Compared with the nADSC-Exo group and untreated control, hypADSC-Exo treatment significantly promoted proliferation, migration and tube-formation capability of HUVECs. Protein array revealed that the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and their receptors (VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2), monocyte chemoattractant protein 4 (MCP-4) were significantly higher in the hypADSC-Exo than in the nADSC-Exo. In the nude mice model of fat grafting, immunofluorescence of CD31 showed that hypADSC-Exo dramatically improved neovascularization around the graft. Furthermore, compared with nADSC-Exo and control groups, cotransplantation of hypADSC-Exo significantly increased the protein expression of EGF, FGF, VEGF/VEGF-R, angiopoietin-1(Ang-1) and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1(Tie-1, an angiopoietin receptor) in the grafted tissue at 30 days after transplantation. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that hypADSC-Exo treatment significantly increased VEGF-R expression in the grafted tissue.CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes from hypoxia-treated human ADSCs possess a higher capacity to enhance angiogenesis in fat grafting, at least partially, via regulating VEGF/VEGF-R signaling.</p>

<p>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates exchange of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins. Evidence from genetic studies that variants in the CETP gene were associated with higher blood HDL cholesterol, lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lower risk of coronary heart disease suggested that pharmacological inhibition of CETP may be beneficial. To date, 4 CETP inhibitors have entered phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trials. Torcetrapib was withdrawn due to unanticipated off-target effects that increased risk of death, and major trials of dalcetrapib and evacetrapib were terminated early for futility. In the 30,000-patient REVEAL (Randomized Evaluation of the Effects of Anacetrapib through Lipid Modification) trial, anacetrapib doubled HDL cholesterol, reduced non-HDL cholesterol by 17 mg/dl (0.44 mmol/l), and reduced major vascular events by 9% over 4 years, but anaceptrapib was found to accumulate in adipose tissue, and regulatory approval is not being sought. Therefore, despite considerable initial promise, CETP inhibition provides insufficient cardiovascular benefit for routine use.</p>

<p>The identification of a functional molecular moiety relating the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) to their capacity to induce inflammation-mediated metabolic diseases needed to be performed. We previously described a proportional increase in the relative abundance of the 16 SrDNA bacterial gene from the genus Ralstonia, within the microbiota from the adipose tissue stroma vascular fraction of obese patients, suggesting a causal role of the bacteria. Therefore, we first characterized the structures of the lipids A, the inflammatory inducing moieties of LPSs, of three Ralstonia species: Ralstonia eutropha, R. mannitolilytica and R. pickettii, and then compared each, in terms of in vitro inflammatory capacities. R. pickettii lipid A displaying only 5 Fatty Acids (FA) was a weaker inducer of inflammation, compared to the two other species harboring hexa-acylated lipids A, despite the presence of 2 AraN substituents on the phosphate groups. With regard to in vitro pro-inflammatory activities, TNF-a and IL-6 inducing capacities were compared on THP-1<U+202F>cells treated with LPSs isolated from the three Ralstonia. R. pickettii, with low inflammatory capacities, and recently involved in nosocomial outcomes, could explain the low inflammatory level reported in previous studies on diabetic patients and animals. In addition, transmission electron microscopy was performed on the three Ralstonia species. It showed that the R. pickettii under-acylated LPSs, with a higher level of phosphate substitution had the capacity of producing more outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The latter could facilitate transfer of LPSs to the blood and explain the increased low-grade inflammation observed in obese/diabetic patients.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Obesity-related, chronic, low-grade inflammation has been identified as a key factor in the development of many metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Adipocytes, preadipocytes, and macrophages have been implicated in initiating inflammation in adipose tissue. This study aims to investigate the effects of fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) on obesity-related inflammation and its mechanisms in vivo and in vitro.METHODS: Monosodium glutamate (MSG) was used to induce obesity in mice and subsequently treated the mice with or without FGF-21. Primary adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction cells were isolated from MSG-obesity mice for additional experiments.RESULTS: Results obtained by ELISA and real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that FGF-21 efficiently ameliorated obesity-related inflammation in MSG-obesity mice. This study demonstrated that preadipocytes and adipocytes responded to anti-inflammatory effects of FGF-21. In vitro, 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes lacking ß-klotho did not respond to FGF-21 under glucose uptake. Interestingly, the treatment of 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes with FGF-21 significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that FGF-21-induced glucose uptake and FGF-21-related anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by different signaling pathways. Moreover, FGF-21 showed anti-inflammatory effects on preadipocytes; these effects are mediated by the fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is high in mouse kidney, but the reason is poorly understood. The aim was to characterize localization, regulation, and function of LPL in kidney of C57BL/6J mice. We found LPL mainly in proximal tubules, localized inside the tubular epithelial cells, under all conditions studied. In fed mice, some LPL colocalized with the endothelial markers CD31 and GPIHBP1 and could be removed by perfusion with heparin, indicating a vascular location. The role of angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) for nutritional modulation of LPL activity was studied in wild-type and Angptl4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In Angptl4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, kidney LPL activity remained high in fasted animals, indicating that ANGPTL4 is involved in suppression of LPL activity on fasting, like in adipose tissue. The amount of ANGPTL4 protein in kidney was low, and the protein appeared smaller in size, compared with ANGPTL4 in heart and adipose tissue. To study the influence of obesity, mice were challenged with high-fat diet for 22 wk, and LPL was studied after an overnight fast compared with fasted mice given food for 3 h. High-fat diet caused blunting of the normal adaptation of LPL activity to feeding/fasting in adipose tissue, but in kidneys this adaptation was lost only in male mice. LPL activity increases to high levels in mouse kidney after feeding, but as no difference in uptake of chylomicron triglycerides in kidneys is found between fasted and fed states, our data confirm that LPL appears to have a minor role for lipid uptake in this organ.</p>

<p>Blood pressure (BP) tracks from childhood to adulthood, and early BP trajectories predict cardiovascular disease risk later in life. Excess postnatal weight gain is associated with vascular changes early in life. However, to what extent it is associated with children’s BP is largely unknown. In 853 healthy 5-year-old children of the Wheezing-Illnesses-Study-Leidsche-Rijn (WHISTLER) birth cohort, systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured, and z scores of individual weight gain rates adjusted for length gain rates were calculated using at least two weight and length measurements from birth until 3 months of age. Linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between weight gain rates adjusted for length gain rates and BP adjusted for sex and ethnicity. Each standard deviation increase in weight gain rates adjusted for length gain rates was associated with 0.9 mmHg (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) higher sitting SBP after adjustment for confounders. Particularly in children in the lowest birth size decile, high excess weight gain was associated with higher sitting SBP values compared to children with low weight gain rates adjusted for length gain rates. BMI and visceral adipose tissue partly explained the association between excess weight gain and sitting SBP (ß 0.5 mmHg, 95% CI -0.3, 1.3). Weight gain rates adjusted for length gain rates were not associated with supine SBP or DBP. Children with excess weight gain, properly adjusted for length gain, in the first three months of life, particularly those with a small birth size, showed higher sitting systolic BP at the age of 5 years.</p>

<p>KEY POINTS: The prevailing dogma about neurogenic regulation of vascular tone consists of major vasodilatation caused by CGRP (and possibly substance P) released from sensory-motor nerves and vasoconstriction caused by noradrenaline, ATP and neuropeptode Y release from sympathetic nerves. Most studies on perivascular nerve-mediated vasodilatation are made in vitro. In the present study, we provide evidence indicating that in vivo electrical perivascular nerve stimulation in rat mesenteric small arteries causes a large ß1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, which contrasts with a smaller vasodilatation caused by endogenous CGRP that is only visible after inhibition of Y1 NPY receptors.</p>

<p>Our study was designed to investigate the effects of IL-7 during the differentiation process of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) toward lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). IL-7 was added to the traditional induced medium, which was called the IL-7 (+) group, while the group that used traditional induced medium was called the IL-7 (-) group. After 7 days of induction of ADSCs, a comprehensive analysis was conducted between these two groups. We examined the changes in Prox1, LYVE-1, Podoplanin and VEGFR-3 on the RNA and protein level and found that the expression of LEC markers in the IL-7 (+) group was higher than in the IL-7 (-) group. The characteristics of differentiated cells were confirmed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. At the same time, we detected the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway involved in the differentiation process, and we found that the phosphorylation of AKT increased, however the expression of ERK was not significantly changed. In conclusion, our study found that IL-7 could improve the differentiation efficiency of ADSCs toward LECs through AKT signaling pathways.</p>

<p>AIMS: Increasing adipose tissue capillarization is beneficial to metabolic health. The present study examined the effects of continuous training (CT) and aerobic-interval training (AIT) coinciding with a high-fat diet (HFD) on capillary density, macrophage polarization in mesenteric (mAT) and subcutaneous (sAT) adipose tissue.MAIN METHODS: 48 male Wistar rats were divided into HFD and normal diet (ND) groups. After 10<U+202F>weeks, each group was divided into sedentary, CT, and AIT. The animals in training groups performed 10-week matched distances of CT and AIT on a motorized treadmill (5<U+202F>times/week).KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that HFD significantly reduced the capillary density of adipose tissue (sAT: 54% vs. mAT:49%) and increased systemic insulin resistance, mean adipocyte size, crown-like structure (CLs), and M1-macrophages with no change in the total number of adipocytes in either tissue. Exercise training reversed the HFD induced adipose tissue dysfunction. Compared to CT, AIT was more effective on increasing the capillary density of sAT (170 vs. 87%) and mAT (140 vs. 100%). Likewise, AIT increased the capillary density of both tissues even in comparison to the ND sedentary group (~25%). Compared with CT as well, AIT more significantly increased the number of M2 macrophages (181 vs. 122%) and decreased CLs (60 vs. 38%) in mAT.SIGNIFICANCE: The findings suggest that hypertrophy is a major contributor to adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Furthermore, exercise training largely demonstrated beneficial effects on adipose tissue remodeling, where AIT is more effective than CT in reducing HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction.</p>

<p>Autologous fat grafting and adipose-derived stem cells are two distinct entities with two different risk profiles, and should be regulated as such. Autologous fat grafting prepared with the additional step of stromal vascular fraction isolation is considered a form of “stem cell therapy” given the high concentration of stem cells found in stromal vascular fraction. Much ambiguity existed in the distinction between autologous fat grafting and stromal vascular fraction initially, in terms of both their biological properties and how they should be regulated. The market has capitalized on this in the past decade to sell unproven “stem cell” therapies to unknowing consumers while exploiting the regulatory liberties of traditional fat grafting. This led to a Draft Guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 proposing stricter regulations on fat grafting in general, which in turn elicited a response from plastic surgeons, who have safely used autologous fat grafting in the clinical setting for over a century. After a series of discussions, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released its Final Guidance in November of 2017, which established clear distinctions between autologous fat grafting and stromal vascular fraction and their separate regulations. By educating ourselves on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s final stance on fat grafting and stem cell therapy, we can learn how to navigate the regulatory waters for the two entities and implement their clinical use in a responsible and informed manner.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue yields adult adipose stem cells (ASCs) in large quantities via less-invasive methods. These cells are of interest owing to their modulating properties and paracrine activities, which can be harnessed in regenerative medicine. Many studies on the use of rat fat tissue in an autologous animal model have been conducted; however, the different locations to obtain stromal vascular fraction of rat fat depots have not been fully characterized. The purpose of the current study was to identify optimal source of ASC from various locations of rat body. Animal experiments in vitro revealed that fat depots from cervical fat are an optimal ASC source. A high ASC yield facilitates subsequent studies on autologous transplantation in rats. The secondary objective was to compare the efficiency of osteoinductive media composition and evaluate of osteogenic potential of ASCs for seeding on scaffolds for bone repair. Scaffolds were assessed in vitro, using rat adipose stem cells and three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds comprising polycaprolactone (PCL) or polycaprolactone covered with tricalcium phosphate (PCL + 5%TCP). Seeded ASCs adhere to the surface and migrate to the scaffolds. Upon staining and determining alkaline phosphatase levels, PCL + 5%TCP scaffolds performed better than PCL scaffolds. Furthermore, growth factors such as BMP2 and FGF2 significantly increased ASC mineralization and induced osteogenesis (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Our results may help select and develop pre-clinical animal model for confirming the use of ASC, alone or in association with appropriate biomaterials for bone repair.</p>

Our primary aim was to examine in a randomized controlled setting whether diets enriched in fatty fish (FF), lean fish (LF) or ALA-rich camelina sativa oil (CSO) differ in their effects on the mRNA expression response of selected inflammation-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in subjects with impaired fasting glucose.</AbstractText>: Molecular mechanisms linking fish and vegetable oil intakes to their healthy metabolic effects may involve attenuation of inflammation.

<p>We discovered a previously undescribed orbital lipid depot in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel during the first ever magnetic resonance image (MRI) of this common experimental model of mammalian hibernation. In animals housed at constant ambient temperatures (5°C or 25°C, 12 h:12 h light:dark photoperiod), the volume of this depot increased in the autumn and decreased in the spring, suggesting an endogenous circannual pattern. Water-fat MRI revealed that throughout the year this depot is composed of ~40% lipid, similar to brown adipose tissue (BAT). During arousal from torpor, thermal images showed higher surface temperatures near this depot before the rest of the head warmed, suggesting a thermoregulatory function. This depot, however, does not contain uncoupling protein 1, a BAT biomarker, or uncoupling protein 3. Histology shows blood vessels in close proximity to each other, suggesting it may serve as a vascular rete, perhaps to preferentially warm the eye and brain during arousals.</p>

<p>Success of 3D tissue substitutes in clinical applications depends on the presence of vascular networks in their structure. Accordingly, research in tissue engineering is focused on the stimulation of angiogenesis or generation of a vascular network in the scaffolds prior to implantation. A novel, xeno-free, collagen/hyaluronic acid-based poly(l-lactide-co-e-caprolactone) (PLC/COL/HA) (20/9.5/0.5 w/w/w) microfibrous scaffold was produced by electrospinning. Collagen types I and III, and hyaluronic acid were isolated from human umbilical cords and blended with the GMP grade PLC. When compared with PLC scaffolds the PLC/COL/HA had higher water uptake capacity (103% vs 66%) which may have contributed to the decrease in its Young’s Modulus (from 1.31 to 0.89<U+202F>MPa). The PLC/COL/HA better supported adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AT MSC) adhesion; within 24<U+202F>h the cell number on the PLC/COL/HA scaffolds was 3 fold higher. Co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and AT MSCs induced capillary formation on both scaffold types, but the PLC/COL/HA led to formation of interconnected vessels whose total length was 1.6 fold of the total vessel length on PLC. Clinical use of this scaffold would eliminate the immune response triggered by xenogeneic collagen and transmission of animal-borne diseases while promoting a better vascular network formation.</p>

<p>The prominence of obesity in the clinical population as well as the strong association of cardiovascular risk factors with obesity has prompted the investigation of the adipose tissue and its physiological contribution to cardiovascular health. A notable finding in these investigations was the discovery of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. Leptin is secreted from the adipose tissue, increases in linear fashion in the circulation with increased body mass and is implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease in obesity, notably via pro-hypertensive mechanisms. Leptin stimulates the activation of the sympathetic nervous system in male patients and mice, which has been implicated as the pro-hypertensive pathway for leptin in obesity. However, obese premenopausal females do not exhibit increased sympathetic activation in response to hyperleptinemia in obesity, indicating a sex-discrepancy in mechanisms of obesity-associated hypertension. Our lab recently demonstrated that leptin also induces the adrenal production of aldosterone in a direct fashion and that this pathway leads to the hyperaldosteronemia that is characteristic of obesity. We have also published data that indicate that the implications of leptin-induced aldosterone are of particular impact in obese females. Leptin-mediated hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, a significant predictor of hypertension clinically, require activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor in female mice. The clinical potential of this pathway remains under investigation; however, existing data indicate that a sex discrepancy exists in mechanisms of leptin-mediated hypertension between males and females and that leptin-stimulated aldosterone plays a significant role in females.</p>

<p>Wang, Liao, Xia, Wang, Mo, Feng, He, Chen, Li, Lu, Cai</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic scars cause cosmetic and functional problems for patients, and their treatment remains challenging. Mechanical micronization of adipose tissue can remove adipocytes and concentrate functional cells. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF)-gel is obtained by a series of simple mechanical processes, including shifting between syringes and centrifugation. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of SVF-gel on hypertrophic scars.METHODS: A model of hypertrophic scars was established in rabbit ears. SVF-gel and SVF cells were obtained from rabbit inguinal fat pads and injected into scars. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a control. Scars were structurally characterized by histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic genes was evaluated.RESULTS: Hypertrophic scars became less visible and softer following injection of SVF-gel or SVF cells. Dermal thickness was significantly lower in the groups treated with SVF-gel and SVF cells than in the PBS-treated group. Treatment with SVF-gel restored subcutaneous fat tissue in scars, while treatment with SVF cells and PBS did not. Injection of SVF-gel and SVF cells reduced macrophage infiltration in the dermal layer and decreased mRNA expression of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In addition, the level of myofibroblasts and collagen deposition were reduced in the groups treated with SVF-gel and SVF cells.CONCLUSIONS: SVF-gel has therapeutic effects on hypertrophic scars. Injection of SVF-gel into hypertrophic scars restores subcutaneous fat tissue and reduces the levels of macrophages and myofibroblasts; thus, it decreased the dermal thickness of the scar.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Despite advances in our understanding of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the treatment of each of its components separately, currently there is no single therapy approved to manage it as a single condition. Since multi-drug treatment increases drug interactions, decreases patient compliance and increases health costs, it is important to introduce single therapies that improve all of the MetS components.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We conducted a PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, US FDA, utdo.ir and clinicaltrial.gov search, gathered the most relevant preclinical and clinical studies that have been published since 2010, and discussed the beneficial effects of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors to prevent and treat different constituent of the MetS as a single therapy. Furthermore, the pharmacology of DPP-4 inhibitors, focusing on pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and their side effects are also reviewed.RESULTS: DPP-4 inhibitors or gliptins are a new class of oral anti-diabetic drugs that seem safe drugs with no severe side effects, commonly GI disturbance, infection and inflammatory bowel disease. They increase mass and function of pancreatic ß-cells, and insulin sensitivity in liver, muscle and adipose tissue. It has been noted that gliptin therapy decreases dyslipidemia. DPP-4 inhibitors increase fatty oxidation, and cholesterol efflux, and decrease hepatic triglyceride synthase and de novo lipogenesis. They delay gastric emptying time and lead to satiety. Besides, gliptin therapy has anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic impacts, and improves endothelial function and reduces vascular stiffness.CONCLUSION: The gathered data prove the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors in managing MetS in some levels beyond anti-diabetic effects. This review could be a lead for designing new DPP-4 inhibitors with greatest effects on MetS in future. Introducing drugs with polypharmacologic effects could increase the patient’s compliance and decrease the health cost that there is not in multi-drug therapy. Graphical abstract <U+115F>.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in adults. A relationship between epicardial adipose tissue and atrial fibrillation has recently been reported.AIM: To evaluate the impact of epicardial fat thickness on the outcome of patients who underwent a first pulmonary vein isolation procedure using a second-generation cryoballoon.METHODS: From February 2012 to February 2017, all patients who underwent a first pulmonary vein isolation procedure using a second-generation cryoballoon at Rouen University Hospital were included. Data were collected retrospectively. Epicardial fat thickness was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was documented atrial fibrillation recurrence at 4 months.RESULTS: A first pulmonary vein isolation procedure using a second-generation cryoballoon was performed in 288 patients; among them, 231 patients (80.2%) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Epicardial fat thickness could be measured accurately in 206 patients (71.5%). Recurrence of atrial fibrillation at 4 months occurred in 32/206 patients (15.5%). In the multivariable analysis, factors predictive of atrial fibrillation recurrence at 4 months were: epicardial fat thickness (hazard ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.20-3.18; P=0.007), the presence of high left atrium enlargement (hazard ratio 4.63, 95% confidence interval 1.17-18.38; P=0.03) and atrial fibrillation recurrence before hospital discharge (hazard ratio 7.55, 95% confidence interval 2.50-22.81; P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSION: Epicardial fat thickness is a predictive factor for atrial fibrillation recurrence after a first pulmonary vein isolation procedure using a second-generation cryoballoon.</p>

<p>Variable absorption rate is one of the biggest problems of fat grafting and one of the most important causes of fat graft volume loss is apoptosis. Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative and besides its antibacterial capacity, it has been widely using for anti-apoptotic effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of minocycline on fat graft survival and adipocyte apoptosis. A total of two main and eight subgroups were designed and a total of 48 experimental animals, 6 in each group, were used. Fat grafts are obtained from Wistar albino rats and implanted to dorsal area of rats. Local and systemic minocycline was applied in the study groups. On the 9th day, apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling method and on the 90th day morphologic characteristics and viability of adipocytes were evaluated using histologic and immunohistochemical methods and statistically compared. This study revealed that the fat grafts were bigger, and they kept their structures better and they were more vascular in the minocycline groups and apoptosis was significantly lower in the minocycline groups. The authors demonstrated that minocycline increases fat graft survival and statistical improvement in apoptosis inhibition via using minocycline therapy has been shown.</p>

Yet, the lack of an efficient vascular network within the scaffolds represents a major limitation to their translation application in patients. Here, we propose the use of microstructured crosslinked gelatin hydrogels with an embedded prevascular channel as scaffolding materials for AT engineering. The scaffolds are fabricated using - simultaneously - alginate-based microbeads and 3D printed filaments as sacrificial material encapsulated in gelatin at the point of material fabrication and removed post-crosslinking. This method yields the formation of microstructures that resemble the micro-architecture of physiological human fat tissue and of microvessels that can facilitate vascularization through anastomosis with patients’ own blood vessels. The cytocompatible method used to prepare the gelatin scaffolds showed structural stability over time while allowing for cell infiltration and protease-based remodeling/degradation. Scaffolds’ mechanical properties were also designed to mimic the one of natural breast adipose tissue, a key parameter for AT regeneration. Scaffold’s embedded channel (Ø<U+202F>=<U+202F>300-400<U+202F>µm) allowed for cell infiltration and enabled blood flow in vitro when an anastomosis with a rat blood artery was performed using surgical glue. In vitro tests with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) showed colonization of the porous structure of the gelatin hydrogels, differentiation into adipocytes and accumulation of lipid droplets, as shown by Oil Red O staining. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The potential clinical use of scaffolds for adipose tissue (AT) regeneration is currently limited by an unmet simultaneous achievement of adequate structural/morphological properties together with a promoted scaffold vascularization. Sacrificial materials, currently used either to obtain a tissue-mimicking structure or hollow channels to promote scaffold’ vascularization, are powerful versatile tools for the fabrication of scaffolds with desired features. However, an integrated approach by means of sacrificial templates aiming at simultaneously achieving an adequate AT-mimicking structure and hollow channels for vascularization is missing. Here, we prove the suitability of crosslinked gelatin scaffolds obtained by using sacrificial alginate microbeads and 3D printed strands to achieve proper features and hollow channels useful for scaffolds vascularization.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obese individuals have a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis, possibly driven by adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. We recently showed that AT macrophages (ATMs), which accumulate in the expanding obese AT, produce mediators causing immune cell recruitment from the bone marrow. In the current study, we evaluated whether ATMs are directly involved in atherosclerotic plaque development.CONCLUSIONS: ATMs from obese vAT do not affect atherosclerotic plaque development or phenotype.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Given the unsatisfactory results and reported drawbacks of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, such as donor site morbidity and the limited choice of grafts in revision surgery, new regenerative approaches based on tissue-engineering strategies are currently under investigation.PURPOSES: To determine (1) if a novel silk fiber-based ACL scaffold is able to initiate osteointegration in the femoral and tibial bone tunnels under in vivo conditions and (2) if the osteointegration process will be improved by intraoperatively seeding the scaffolds with the autologous stromal vascular fraction, an adipose-derived, stem cell-rich isolate from knee fat pads.STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.METHODS: A total of 33 sheep underwent ACL resection and were then randomly assigned to 2 experimental groups: ACL reconstruction with a scaffold alone and ACL reconstruction with a cell-seeded scaffold. Half of the sheep in each group were randomly chosen and euthanized 6 months after surgery and the other half at 12 months. To analyze the integration of the silk-based scaffold in the femoral and tibial bone tunnels, hard tissue histology and micro-computed tomography measurements were performed.RESULTS: Hard tissue histological workup showed that in all treatment groups, with or without the application of the autologous stromal vascular fraction, an interzone of collagen fibers had formed between bone and silk-based graft. This collagen-fiber continuity partly consisted of Sharpey fibers, comparable with tendon-bone healing known for autografts and allografts. Insertion sites were more broad based at 6 months and more concentrated on the slightly protruding, bony knoblike structures at 12 months. Histologically, no differences between the treatment groups were detectable. Analysis of micro-computed tomography measurements revealed a significantly higher tissue density for the cell-seeded scaffold group as compared with the scaffold-alone group in the tibial but not femoral bone tunnel after 12 months of implantation.CONCLUSION: The novel silk fiber-based scaffold for ACL regeneration demonstrated integration into the bone tunnels via the formation of a fibrous interzone similar to allografts and autografts. Histologically, additional cell seeding did not enhance osteointegration. No significant differences between 6 and 12 months could be detected. After 12 months, there was still a considerable amount of silk present, and a longer observation period is necessary to see if a true ligament-bone enthesis will be formed.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: ACL regeneration with a silk fiber-based scaffold with and without additional cell seeding may provide an alternative treatment option to current techniques of surgical reconstruction.</p>

<p>Recently, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), obtained from fresh human lipoaspirate, have shown promise as immunomodulatory agents having demonstrated immunosuppressive functionality both in vitro and in vivo. A number of researchers have described the isolation of ASCs through the enzymatic digestion of fat samples, followed by a number of purification steps, involving centrifugation and filtration. Here, we utilize a standard isolation technique, with the added purification of putative ASCs by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). ASCs are an extremely valuable resource in clinical applications, including reconstruction, regeneration, and investigations into immune activity. This method could be used to isolate and purify ASCs for such downstream applications.</p>

<p>Traumatic composite bone-muscle injuries, such as open fractures, often require multiple surgical interventions and still typically result in long-term disability. Clinically, a critical indicator of composite injury severity is vascular integrity; vascular damage alone is sufficient to assign an open fracture to the most severe category. Challenging bone injuries are often treated with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), an osteoinductive growth factor, delivered on collagen sponge. Previous studies in a composite defect model found that a minimally bridging dose in the segmental defect model was unable to overcome concomitant muscle damage, but the effect of BMP dose on composite injuries has not yet been studied. Here, we test the hypotheses that BMP-2-mediated functional regeneration of composite extremity injuries is dose dependent and can be further enhanced via co-delivery of adipose-derived microvascular fragments (MVF), which have been previously shown to increase tissue vascular volume. Although MVF did not improve healing outcomes, we observed a significant BMP-2 dose-dependent increase in regenerated bone volume and biomechanical properties. This is the first known report of an increased BMP-2 dose improving bone healing with concomitant muscle damage. While high dose BMP-2 delivery can induce heterotopic ossification (HO) and increased inflammation, the maximum 10<U+2009>µg dose used in this study did not result in HO and was associated with a lower circulating inflammatory cytokine profile than the low dose (2.5<U+2009>µg) group. These data support the potential benefits of an increased, though still moderate, BMP-2 dose for treatment of bone defects with concomitant muscle damage. Published 2019.

<p>IMPACT STATEMENT: We here showed that even under optimized conditions for biochemical differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (with respect to a pronounced marker protein expression for a reasonable period of time) it was not possible to obtain functional smooth muscle cells from all donors. Moreover, an underestimated role may play the effect of the scaffold material on smooth muscle cell functionality. Both aspects are crucial for the successful tissue engineering of the vascular medial layer combining autologous cells with a suitable scaffold material and thus should be thoroughly addressed in each individualized therapeutic approach.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: In craniofacial reconstruction, the gold standard procedure for bone regeneration is the autologous bone graft (BG). However, this procedure requiring bone harvesting is a source of morbidity. Bone substitutes, such as biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), represent an interesting alternative but are not sufficient for bone healing in hypoplastic conditions. In such conditions, osteoprogenitors are essential to provide osteoinduction. Previous studies have shown that BCP associated with total bone marrow (TBM) provides same bone reconstruction as bone graft in a rat model of calvaria defect. Furthermore, adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) seems to be another promising source of osteoprogenitor cells that can be used intra-operatively. This study aimed to combine, intra-operative BCP-based bone tissue engineering strategies with TBM or SVF from human sources.METHODS: 5<U+2009>mm critical-size calvaria defects were performed in 18 nude rat. The defects were filled with intra-operative bone tissue engineering procedures: human BG, human TBM<U+2009>+<U+2009>BCP, human SVF<U+2009>+<U+2009>BCP and, rat TBM<U+2009>+<U+2009>BCP. Animals were sacrificed 8 weeks after implantation and calvaria were processed for histological and radiological examinations. Implanted cells were labelled with a fluorochrome.RESULTS: Micro-CT analysis revealed partial repair of bone defect. Only hBG significantly succeeded in healing the defect (43.1%). However, low rate of newly formed bone tissue was observed in all tissue engineering conditions (hTBM, hSVF, ratTBM).DISCUSSION: The lack of bone formation observed in this study could possibly be attributed to the model.CONCLUSION: This study combined with a literature analysis show the stringency of the nude rat calvaria model in term of bone regeneration.</p>

<p>Background Perivascular adipose tissue ( PVAT ) is causally associated with vascular function and the pathogenesis of vascular disease in association with metabolically driven chronic inflammation called metaflammation. However, the difference in PVAT surrounding the coronary artery ( CA - PVAT ) and that surrounding the internal thoracic artery (ITA-PVAT), a vessel resistant to atherosclerosis, remains unclear. Herein, we investigated whether CA - PVAT , ITA - PVAT , and subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SCAT ) have distinct phenotypes. Methods and Results Fat pads were sampled from 44 patients (men/women, 36:8; age, 67±13 years) with CA disease who underwent elective CA bypass grafting. Adipocyte size in ITA - PVAT and that in CA - PVAT were significantly smaller than that in SCAT . A greater extent of fibrosis and increased gene expression levels of fibrosis-related molecules were observed in CA - PVAT than those in SCAT and those in ITA - PVAT . CA - PVAT exhibited more pronounced metaflammation, as indicated by a significantly larger extent of CD 68-positive and CD 11c-positive M1 macrophages, a lower ratio of CD 206-positive M2 to CD 11c-positive M1 macrophages, a lower gene expression level of adiponectin, and higher gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome- and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related molecules, than did ITA - PVAT and SCAT . Expression patterns of adipocyte developmental and pattern-forming genes were totally different among SCAT , ITA - PVAT, and CA - PVAT . Conclusions The phenotype of ITA - PVAT is closer to that of SCAT than that of CA - PVAT , which may result from inherent differences in adipocytes. ITA - PVAT appears to be protected from metaflammation and consecutive adipose tissue remodeling, which may contribute to the decreased atherosclerotic plaque burden in the ITA.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Studies of using mesenchymal stem cells to assist skin and soft tissue expansion have shown that stem cells can improve expansion efficiency through promoting tissue regeneration. However, the issue that whether the flap viability is also improved is unknown.METHODS: Sixteen pigs were equally divided into 2 groups. A pair of 150 mL expanders was symmetrically inserted into each pig’s dorsum. Group 1 received adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) injection before expansion, and group 2 received ADSCs grafting after flap elevation. After 4 weeks’ expansion, a random flap measuring 2 cm × 16 cm was elevated along the long axis of each expanded flap on the pigs’ back. Flap viability was measured at postoperative day 7. Histological analysis and cell tracking were performed. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was determined.RESULTS: The flap viability of the ADSCs-grafted expanded flap (75.5 ± 6.6%) was similar to the control (69.4 ± 8.4%) in group 1 (transplantation before expansion). However, in group 2 (transplantation after flap elevation), the ADSCs-grafted expanded flap had a higher flap viability (92.6 ± 5.7%) compared with control (66.2 ± 7.4%). Moreover, the ADSCs-grafted expanded flap in group 1 showed increased skin thickness, collagen content, cells proliferation, vascularization, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Cell tracking showed that the positively stained cell differentiating into an endotheliocyte could be seen in group 2.CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of ADSCs before tissue expansion does not improve flap viability but can promote tissue regeneration. Injection of ADSCs after flap elevation can increase the surviving rate of the expanded flap.</p>

<p>Colorectal cancer affects the large intestine, leading to loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) and alterations in adipokine secretion. Lower incidence of colorectal cancer is associated with increased fibre intake. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are fibres that increase production of butyrate by the intestinal microbiota. Tributyrin, a prodrug of butyric acid, exerts beneficial anti-inflammatory effects on colorectal cancer. Our aim was to characterise the effects of diets rich in FOS and tributyrin within the context of a colon carcinogenesis model, and characterise possible support of tumorigenesis by WAT. C57/BL6 male mice were divided into four groups: a control group (CT) fed with chow diet and three colon carcinogenesis-induced groups fed either with chow diet (CA), tributyrin-supplemented diet (BUT), or with FOS-supplemented diet. Colon carcinogenesis decreased adipose mass in subcutaneous, epididymal, and retroperitoneal tissues, while also reducing serum glucose and leptin concentrations. However, it did not alter the concentrations of adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-a in WAT. Additionally, the supplements did not revert the colon cancer affected parameters. The BUT group exhibited even higher glucose tolerance and levels of IL-6, VEGF, and TNF-a in WAT. To conclude our study, FOS and butyrate supplements were not beneficial. In addition, butyrate worsened adipose tissue inflammation.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction are associated with obesity. Studies in obese patients and animals demonstrate that the MR (mineralocorticoid receptor) contributes to obesity-associated cardiovascular complications through its specific role in AT. However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate whether MR regulates mitochondrial function in obesity, resulting in AT premature aging and vascular dysfunction. Obese (db/db) and lean (db/+) mice were treated with an MR antagonist or a specific mitochondria-targeted antioxidant. Mitochondrial and vascular functions were determined by respirometry and myography, respectively. Molecular mechanisms were probed by Western immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction in visceral AT and arteries and focused on senescence markers and redox-sensitive pathways. db/db mice displayed AT senescence with activation of the p53-p21 pathway and decreased SIRT (sirtuin) levels, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the beneficial anticontractile effects of perivascular AT were lost in db/db via ROCK (Rho kinase) activation. MR blockade prevented these effects. Thus, MR activation in obesity induces mitochondrial dysfunction and AT senescence and dysfunction, which consequently increases vascular contractility. In conclusion, our study identifies novel mechanistic insights involving MR, adipose mitochondria, and vascular function that may be of importance to develop new therapeutic strategies to limit obesity-associated cardiovascular complications.</p>

<p>Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) has attracted clinical interest not only because it dissipates energy but also for its potential capacity to counteract obesity and related metabolic disorders (e.g., insulin resistance and dyslipidemia). Cold exposure is the most powerful stimulus for activating and recruiting BAT, and this stimulatory effect is mediated by the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. BAT can also be activated by other receptors such as the G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1) or ß-adrenergic receptors. Interestingly, these receptors also interact with several dietary components; in particular, capsinoids and tea catechins appear to mimic the effects of cold through a TRP-BAT axis, and they consequently seem to decrease body fat and improve metabolic blood parameters. This systematic review critically addresses the evidence behind the available human studies analyzing the effect of several dietary components (e.g., capsinoids, tea catechins, and ephedrine) on BAT activity. Even though the results of these studies are consistent with the outcomes of preclinical models, the lack of robust study designs makes it impossible to confirm the BAT-activation capacity of the specified dietary components. Further investigation into the effects of dietary components on BAT is warranted to clarify to what extent these components could serve as a powerful strategy to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play vital roles in cardiovascular pathophysiology, such as energy balance, cell proliferation/apoptosis, inflammatory response, and adipocyte differentiation. These vital roles make PPARs potential targets for therapeutic prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Emerging evidence indicates that the crosstalk of microRNAs (miRNAs) and PPARs contributes greatly to CVD pathogenesis. PPARs are inhibited by miRNAs at posttranscriptional mechanisms in the progress of pulmonary hypertension and vascular dysfunction involving cell proliferation/apoptosis, communication, and normal function of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. In the development of atherosclerosis and stroke, the activation of PPARs could change the transcripts of target miRNA through miRNA signalling. Furthermore, the mutual regulation of PPARs and miRNAs involves cell proliferation/apoptosis, cardiac remodeling, and dysfunction in heart diseases. In addition, obesity, an important cardiovascular risk, is modulated by the regulatory axis of PPARs/miRNAs, including adipogenesis, adipocyte dysfunction, insulin resistance, and macrophage polarization in adipose tissue. In this review, the crosstalk of PPARs and miRNAs and their emerging regulatory roles are summarized in the context of CVDs and risks. This provides an understanding of the underlying mechanism of the biological process related to CVD pathophysiology involving the interaction of PPARs and miRNAs and will lead to the development of PPARs/miRNAs as effective anti-CVD medications.</p>

<h4>New Therapeutic Implications of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) Function/Dysfunction in Cardiovascular Disease.</h4>

<p>The Global Burden of Disease Study identified cardiovascular risk factors as leading causes of global deaths and life years lost. Endothelial dysfunction represents a pathomechanism that is associated with most of these risk factors and stressors, and represents an early (subclinical) marker/predictor of atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress is a trigger of endothelial dysfunction and it is a hall-mark of cardiovascular diseases and of the risk factors/stressors that are responsible for their initiation. Endothelial function is largely based on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function and activity. Likewise, oxidative stress can lead to the loss of eNOS activity or even “uncoupling” of the enzyme by adverse regulation of well-defined “redox switches” in eNOS itself or up-/down-stream signaling molecules. Of note, not only eNOS function and activity in the endothelium are essential for vascular integrity and homeostasis, but also eNOS in perivascular adipose tissue plays an important role for these processes. Accordingly, eNOS protein represents an attractive therapeutic target that, so far, was not pharmacologically exploited. With our present work, we want to provide an overview on recent advances and future therapeutic strategies that could be used to target eNOS activity and function in cardiovascular (and other) diseases, including life style changes and epigenetic modulations. We highlight the redox-regulatory mechanisms in eNOS function and up- and down-stream signaling pathways (e.g., tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism and soluble guanylyl cyclase/cGMP pathway) and their potential pharmacological exploitation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from adipose tissue is an alternative to cultured adipose-derived stem cells for use in regenerative medicine and represents a promising therapy for vasculopathy and hand disability in systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, the bioactivity of autologous SVF is not documented in this disease context. This study aimed to compare the molecular and functional profiles of the SVF-based medicinal product obtained from SSc and healthy subjects.METHODS: Good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade SVF from 24 patients with SSc and 12 healthy donors (HD) was analysed by flow cytometry to compare the distribution of the CD45- and CD45+ haematopoietic cell subsets. The ability of SVF to form a vascular network was assessed using Matrigel in vivo assay. The transcriptomic and secretory profiles of the SSc-SVF were assessed by RNA sequencing and multiplex analysis, respectively, and were compared with the HD-SVF.RESULTS: The distribution of the leucocyte, endothelial, stromal, pericyte and transitional cell subsets was similar for SSc-SVF and HD-SVF. SSc-SVF retained its vasculogenic capacity, but the density of neovessels formed in SVF-loaded Matrigel implanted in nude mice was slightly decreased compared with HD-SVF. SSc-SVF displayed a differential molecular signature reflecting deregulation of angiogenesis, endothelial activation and fibrosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence that SSc does not compromise the vascular repair capacity of SVF, supporting its use as an innovative autologous biotherapy. The characterisation of the specific SSc-SVF molecular profile provides new perspectives for delineating markers of the potency of SVF and its targets for the treatment of SSc.</p>

<p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is located around the adventitia, composed primarily by adipocytes, stromal cells, leukocytes, fibroblasts and capillaries. It is well described that PVAT is an important modulator of the vascular tone being considered a biologically active tissue, releasing both vasoconstrictor and vasodilators factors. The literature shows that the anti-contractile effect induced by PVAT may be due to activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).Investigate whether the renin-angiotensin system participates in the effect exerted by perivascular adipose tissue on the vascular tone.</AbstractText>: Investigate whether the renin-angiotensin system participates in the effect exerted by perivascular adipose tissue on the vascular tone.</p>

<p>AIM: Perineal defects following the resection of anorectal malignancies are a reconstructive challenge. Flaps based on the rectus abdominis muscle have several drawbacks. Regional perforator flaps may be a suitable alternative. We present our experience of using the gluteal fold flap (GFF) for reconstructing perineal and pelvic defects.METHODS: We used a retrospective chart review and follow-up examinations focusing on epidemiological, oncological (procedure and outcome), and therapy-related data. This included postoperative complications and their management, length of hospital stay, and time to heal.RESULTS: Twenty-two GFFs (unilateral n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8; bilateral n<U+2009>=<U+2009>7) were performed in 15 patients (nine women and six men; anal squamous cell carcinoma n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8; rectal adenocarcinoma n<U+2009>=<U+2009>7; mean age 65.5 + 8.2 years) with a mean follow-up time of 1 year. Of the cases, 73.3% were a recurrent disease. Microscopic tumor resection was achieved in all but one case (93.3%). Seven cases had no complications (46.7%). Surgical complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system (grades I n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2; II n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2; IIIb n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4). These were mainly wound healing disorders that did not affect mobilization or discharge. The time to discharge was 22 + 9.9 days. The oncological outcomes were as follows: 53.3% of the patients had no evidence of disease, 20% had metastatic disease, 20% had local recurrent disease, and one patient (6.7%) died of other causes.CONCLUSIONS: The GFF is a robust, reliable flap suitable for perineal and pelvic reconstruction. It can be raised quickly and easily, has an acceptable complication rate and donor site morbidity, and does not affect the abdominal wall.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the potential association of different microRNA (miRNA) molecules with both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity and determine their target genes.METHODS: Quantitative PCR was used to analyze the miR-20b, miR-296, and Let-7f levels in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (ATs) in relation to obesity and T2D, miRTarBase 4.0 was used for validation of target genes, and the Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) Classification System and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) were used to annotate the biological processes of the predicted targets.RESULTS: In AT, miR-20b, miR-296, and Let-7f levels were significantly different between normoglycemic subjects and those with T2D. In visceral adipose tissue, miRNA levels were higher in normoglycemic/obesity samples than in T2D/obesity samples. miR-20b-miR-296 and Let-7f target genes that showed significant differences in both ATs in relation to obesity and T2D were CDKN1A, CX3CL1, HIF1A, PPP2R1B, STAT3, and VEGFA. These genes are known to be principally involved in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and WNT pathways.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides experimental evidence of the possible correlation between AT miR-20b-miR-296-Let-7f with obesity and T2D, which might involve vascular endothelial growth factor and WNT-dependent pathways that are regulated by six different genes, suggesting a novel signaling pathway that could be important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the AT dysfunction associated with obesity and T2D.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: We studied the correlation of quantified epicardial fat with severity of coronary artery disease in patients [suspected cases of coronary artery disease (CAD)] referred for computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography and established cutoffs for epicardial fat volume (EFV) for the presence of CAD and obstructive CAD.METHODS: A prospective cum retrospective cross-sectional observational study was carried out on 950 Indian subjects (suspected cases of CAD) who were referred for coronary CT in the year 2013-2016. EFV was quantified using semiautomatic technique on multidetector coronary CT angiography. The presence of atherosclerotic plaques and degree of stenosis was assessed on coronary CT angiography scans. The correlation between quantified EFV and degree of stenosis was assessed. Multivariate analysis was also performed.RESULTS: A higher quantity of epicardial fat is found in patients with increasing severity of coronary artery stenosis. The EFV cutoff for the presence of CAD and obstructive CAD are 49.75 and 67.69 mL with area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of 0.68, 81%, 45.9%,58.24%, 72.2%, and 62.84% and 0.709, 64.9%, 66.4%, 35.84%, 86.55%, and 66%, respectively. EFV correlates with age, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Multivariate analysis revealed EFV to be an independent risk factor for the presence of CAD.CONCLUSIONS: Higher quantities of EFV are found in patients with greater degree of coronary artery stenosis. EFV correlates with age, weight, and BMI. EFV is an independent risk factor for CAD.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND Treating acute injury of the heel fat pad is different from treating common soft tissue damage. Due to the paucity of literature on the topic, we described our initial experience treating acute injury of the heel fat pad to determine the ideal treatment method. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 53 patients with acute injury of the heel fat pad admitted to our hospital were selected for the study and were randomly divided into 2 groups: the compressed fixation combined with vacuum-assisted closure group and the only reimplanted and sewn group. Twenty-seven of the heel fat pads were compressed and fixed using a flat, hard piece of plastic and hollow screws; then, they were covered with a vacuum-assisted closure device. The other 27 were only sewn without tension. The clinical results were evaluated according to the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score and the British Medical Research Council function evaluation criteria RESULTS In the compressed fixation combined with vacuum-assisted closure group, flaps of 12 feet with retrograde avulsion injury survived successfully. Partial flap necrosis occurred in 8 feet. Seven feet underwent repair using the neurocutaneous vascular resupinated island flap. Results were excellent or good for 74% of patients according to the AOFS. However, in the only reimplanted and sewn group, results were excellent or good for 44% of patients according to the AOFS. CONCLUSIONS Compressed fixation with vacuum-assisted closure is effective for treating acute injury of the heel fat pad, with high success rates and good utility.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AIMS: Preclinical and observational reports indicate that adipose tissue (AT) is a safe and promising tool to treat non-healing venous leg ulcers (VLUs).METHODS: From an initial cohort of 38 patients, 16 patients affected by non-healing VLUs were randomly allocated to the experimental arm (5 men and 3 women) and control arm (5 men and 3 women). In the experimental arm, wounds were treated by debridement, centrifuged adipose tissue (CAT), advanced dressings and compression. No experimental treatment (CAT) was administered to the control arm. We investigated the functional and the immunophenotypical features of the harvested CAT-derived stem cells. The primary outcome measures were healing time and safety of the cell treatment. Secondary outcomes were pain evaluated by numeric rating scale (NRS), complete wound healing at 24 weeks by Margolis Index and wound-healing process expressed in square centimeters per week. The various immunophenotypic and functional characteristics of CAT-derived stem cells were then correlated with the clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>AIMS: To test the effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin on adipose tissue inflammation and microvascular function, and whole-body postprandial endothelial function.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted between June 2013 and November 2016 in 44 overweight or obese people without diabetes (saxagliptin, n=28; placebo, n=16). Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies, a 4-h fat-enriched meal test and peripheral arterial tonometry for measurement of endothelial function were performed at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment with saxagliptin (5 mg/day) or matching placebo.RESULTS: Forty participants were analysed (saxagliptin, n=26; placebo, n=14). Secretion of interleukin-8 from adipose tissue explants was reduced after saxagliptin (median fold-change from baseline: 0.8 saxagliptin vs 3.3 placebo; P=0.02). Adipose tissue expression of thioredoxin-inhibitory protein (TxNIP) was lower after saxagliptin (0.75 vs 1.0; P=0.02), while there were no significant differences in adipose tissue secretion of interleukin-1b, interleukin-6 or macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), adipose tissue macrophage content, adipose tissue mRNA levels of mcp1, cd36, cd68, il6, il8, txnip and adpq, and activation of adipose tissue inflammatory pathways [extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF- <U+03BA>B)] or insulin-induced vasodilation of adipose tissue arterioles. Postprandial plasma glucose was slightly lower (by an estimated 0.3 mmol/l; P=0.01), while postprandial insulin, triglyceride levels and endothelial function were unchanged after saxagliptin.CONCLUSIONS: The effect of saxagliptin on adipose tissue inflammation was relatively modest, with many inflammatory markers unchanged. We also found no evidence that saxagliptin therapy improved adipose tissue arteriole vasodilation or postprandial endothelial function.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) have potential in bioengineering angiogenesis due to their paracrine role in supporting endothelial tubulogenesis and vascular network formation. However, the precise mechanism of the inner angiogenic capacity of ASCs determined by the biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix needs to be further elucidated. In the current study, we fabricated two silicon-based elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with different stiffnesses (stiff substrate, E<U+2009>=<U+2009>195<U+2009>kPa and soft substrate, E<U+2009>=<U+2009>15<U+2009>kPa) and found there were cytoskeletal changes in ASCs in response to different substrate stiffnesses. We then showed the expression of vinculin in focal adhesion plaques was enhanced and the nuclear translocation of ß-catenin signaling was increased in ASCs on the stiff substrate relative to those on the soft substrate. We next used bioinformatics and found the downstream proteins of ß-catenin signaling had binding sites in the promoter of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), which is responsible for angiogenesis; then, we further confirmed the enhanced endogenous VEGFA expression in ASCs on the stiff substrate relative to that on the soft substrate. Finally, by using ectogenic VEGFA, we showed the stiff substrate could promote angiogenesis of ASCs in the form of more ring-like formations in 2D and vessel-like structure formations in 3D under VEGFA induction compared to that of the soft substrate. This study not only indicates the inner angiogenic capacity of ASCs but also elucidates the influence of substrate elasticity on ASC differentiation in bioengineering angiogenesis.</p>

<p>The fabrication of functional tissues is essential for clinical applications such as disease treatment and drug discovery. Recent studies have revealed that the mechanical environments of tissues, determined by geometric cell patterns, material composition, or mechanical properties, play critical roles in ensuring proper tissue function. Here, we propose an acoustophoretic technique using surface acoustic waves to fabricate therapeutic vascular tissue containing a three-dimensional collateral distribution of vessels. Co-aligned human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human adipose stem cells that are arranged in a biodegradable catechol-conjugated hyaluronic acid hydrogel exhibit enhanced cell-cell contacts, gene expression, and secretion of angiogenic and anti-inflammatory paracrine factors. The therapeutic effects of the fabricated vessel constructs are demonstrated in experiments using an ischemia mouse model by exhibiting the remarkable recovery of damaged tissue. Our study can be referenced to fabricate various types of artificial tissues that mimic the original functions as well as structures.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is an excellent source for isolation of stem cells for treating various clinical conditions including injuries to the neuromuscular system. Many previous studies have focused on differentiating these adipose stem cells (ASCs) towards a Schwann cell-like phenotype (dASCs), which can enhance axon regeneration and reduce muscle atrophy. However, the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), from which the ASCs are derived, also exerts broad regenerative potential and might provide a faster route to clinical translation of the cell therapies for treatment of neuromuscular disorders.</AbstractText>: Adipose tissue is an excellent source for isolation of stem cells for treating various clinical conditions including injuries to the neuromuscular system.

<p>Torsion-detorsion (T/D)-induced testicular injury may lead to male subfertility and even infertility. Stem cell therapy provides an alternative to attenuate testicular injury and promote spermatogenesis. Adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) can be acquired conveniently without in vitro expansion, which may avoid the potential risks of microbial contamination, xenogenic nutritional sources, etc., during cell culture. In this study, we investigate the protective effects of autologous uncultured SVF on testicular injury and spermatogenesis in a rat model of T/D. Animals were randomly divided into sham, T/D+ phosphate-buffered saline, and T/D + SVF groups (18 rats in each group). SVF was isolated, labeled with lipophilic fluorochrome chloromethylbenzamido dialkylcarbocyanine, and transplanted into T/D testis by local injection. At 3, 7, 14, and 28 days F surgery, testicular tissue and serum samples were harvested for histopathological, immunohistochemical, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histopathological findings demonstrated severe injury in the testis with decreased Johnsen’s score led by T/D, while uncultured SVF reduced testicular injury and elevated the decreased score. Injected SVF cells were mainly integrated into interstitial region and seminiferous tubules, enhanced the secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor and stem cell factor in the testis, contributed to the declining level of malondialdehyde and restoration of hormonal homeostasis, and then reduced the injury of Leydig cells and germ cells, as well as promoting spermatogenesis. Our findings demonstrated that autologous uncultured SVF could protect the testis from testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury and promote spermatogenesis, which provide significant clinical implications for the prevention of infertility induced by testicular T/D.

<p>BACKGROUND: Conservative therapies for the treatment of knee degenerative processes are used before resorting to surgery; nonetheless, they may offer only short-term benefits. Encouraging preliminary results have been reported using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), either alone or in association with surgery. Among the many sources, adipose tissue has created a huge interest, because of its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties ascribed to the cells of its stromal vascular fraction. We previously reported the safety and feasibility of autologous micro-fragmented adipose tissue as adjuvant for the surgical treatment of diffuse degenerative chondral lesions at 1 year. Here we present the outcomes of the same cohort of patients evaluated at 3 year follow-up. Micro-fragmented adipose tissue was obtained using a minimal manipulation technique in a closed system. The safety of the procedure was evaluated by recording type and incidence of any adverse event. The clinical outcomes were determined using the KOOS, IKDC-subjective, Tegner Lysholm Knee, and VAS pain scales taken pre-operatively and at 12 and 36 months follow-up.FINDINGS: No adverse events, lipodystrophy cases at the harvesting site nor atypical inflammatory reactions at the joint level were reported. Of the 30 patients previously treated, one was lost, and seven received additional treatments in the period of observation. On average, the 22 patients that had no other treatments in the 3-year period showed that the results observed at 1 year were maintained. Moreover, 41, 55, 55 and 64% of the patients improved with respect to the 1-year follow-up in the Tegner Lysholm Knee, VAS, IKDC-subjective and total KOOS, respectively.CONCLUSION: Our results point to autologous and micro-fragmented adipose tissue injection as an innovative and safe approach for the management of diffuse degenerative knee chondropathy in the mid-term. The procedure is simple, affordable, minimally invasive, and compliant with the regulatory panorama.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue has a primary role in lipid and glucose metabolism as a storage site for fatty acids, and also functions as an endocrine organ, producing large numbers of hormones and cytokines. Adipose dysfunction triggers a number of obesity-associated health problems. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the molecular mechanisms of white adipose tissue (WAT). The GSE9954 microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Adipose-specific genes were identified through limma package analysis, based on samples of WAT and 17 other types of non-adipose tissue obtained from mice. Process and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for these genes. Finally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) and co-expression networks were constructed and analyzed. In total, 202 adipose-specific genes were identified, which were involved in key biological processes (including fat cell differentiation and lipid metabolic process) and one key pathway [namely, the adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway]. Construction of the PPI network and further molecular complex detection revealed the presence of 17 key genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase a, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) <U+03B3> and leptin, that were involved in the AMPK, PPAR and insulin signaling pathways. In addition, amine oxidase copper containing 3 and adrenoceptor beta 3 were communication hubs in the co-expression network of adipose-specific genes. In conclusion, the present study promotes our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of WAT, and may offer an insight into the prevention and treatment of obesity-associated diseases caused by adipose dysfunction.</p>

<p>Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is thought to play a role in vascular homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of large vessel diseases, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Herein, we tested the hypothesis that locally restricted transcriptional profiles characterize PVAT surrounding AAA, indicating specific dysfunctions associated with the disease. Approach and Results- Using a paired sample design to limit the effects of interindividual variation, we performed a microarray-based investigation of the PVAT transcriptome in 30 patients with AAA, comparing the adipose layer of the dilated abdominal aorta with that of the not-dilated aortic neck in each patient. Furthermore, we used a state-of-the-art data mining procedure to remove the effect of confounders produced by high-throughput gene expression techniques. We found substantial differences in PVAT gene expression clearly distinguishing the dilated from the not-dilated aorta, which increased in number and magnitude with increasing AAA diameter. Comparisons with other adipose depots (omental or subcutaneous fat) confirmed that gene expression changes are locally restricted. We dissected putative mechanisms associated with AAA PVAT dysfunction through a functional enrichment network analysis: both innate and adaptive immune-response genes along with genes related to cell-death pathways, metabolic processes of collagen, sphingolipids, aminoglycans, and extracellular matrix degradation were strongly overrepresented in PVAT of AAA compared with PVAT of the not-dilated aorta. Conclusions- Our results support a possible function of PVAT in AAA pathogenesis and suggest that AAA is an immunologic disease with an underlying autoimmune component. Interfering with these disease-specific pathways would clarify their precise role in AAA pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contains an independent adrenergic system that can take up, metabolize, release, and potentially synthesize the vasoactive catecholamine norepinephrine. Norepinephrine has been detected in PVAT, but the mechanism of its protection within this tissue is unknown. Here, we investigate whether PVAT adipocytes can store norepinephrine using VMAT (vesicular monoamine transporter). Approach and Results- High-performance liquid chromatography identified norepinephrine in normal male Sprague Dawley rat aortic, superior mesenteric artery, and mesenteric resistance vessel PVATs, and retroperitoneal fat. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed VMAT1 and VMAT2 mRNA expression in the adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction of mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of VMAT1 and VMAT2, and the colocalization of VMAT2 with norepinephrine, in the cytoplasm of adipocytes in mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT. A protocol was developed to capture real-time uptake of Mini 202-a functional and fluorescent VMAT probe-in live rat PVAT adipocytes. Mini 202 was taken up by freshly isolated and differentiated adipocytes from mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT and adipocytes from thoracic aortic and superior mesenteric artery PVATs. In adipocytes freshly isolated from mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT, addition of rose bengal (VMAT inhibitor), nisoxetine (norepinephrine transporter inhibitor), or corticosterone (organic cation 3 transporter inhibitor) significantly reduced Mini 202 signal. Immunofluorescence supports that neither VMAT1 nor VMAT2 is present in retroperitoneal adipocytes, suggesting that PVAT adipocytes may be unique in storing norepinephrine. Conclusions- This study supports a novel function of PVAT adipocytes in storing amines in a VMAT-dependent manner. It provides a foundation for future studies exploring the purpose and mechanisms of norepinephrine storage by PVAT in normal physiology and obesity-related hypertension.</p>

<p>We found previously that white adipose tissue (WAT) hyperplasia in obese mice was limited by dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA). Here we aimed to characterize the underlying mechanism. C57BL/6N mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented or not with omega-3 PUFA for one week or eight weeks; mice fed a standard chow diet were also used. In epididymal WAT (eWAT), DNA content was quantified, immunohistochemical analysis was used to reveal the size of adipocytes and macrophage content, and lipidomic analysis and a gene expression screen were performed to assess inflammatory status. The stromal-vascular fraction of eWAT, which contained most of the eWAT cells, except for adipocytes, was characterized using flow cytometry. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation limited the high-fat diet-induced increase in eWAT weight, cell number (DNA content), inflammation, and adipocyte growth. eWAT hyperplasia was compromised due to the limited increase in the number of preadipocytes and a decrease in the number of endothelial cells. The number of leukocytes and macrophages was unaffected, but a shift in macrophage polarization towards a less inflammatory phenotype was observed. Our results document that the counteraction of eWAT hyperplasia by omega-3 PUFA in dietary-obese mice reflects an effect on the number of adipose lineage and endothelial cells.</p>

<p>To disclose the mechanisms surrounding obesity, we selected microRNAs (miRNAs) that target genes involved in adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammation and compared their expression levels in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of 40 obese and nonobese women. Mature miRNAs were extracted from subcutaneous adipose tissue samples that were collected during surgery and quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. miR-16 was overexpressed in the nonobese group (n-expression ratio = - 151.1; P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Furthermore, the expression levels of two other miRNAs were significantly correlated with waist circumference in nonobese women (miR-27b, r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.453; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.027 and miR-424-5p, r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.502, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.014). Central and total subcutaneous adipose tissue thicknesses were correlated with miR-424-5p levels (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.506, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.034 and r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.475, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.046, respectively) in the nonobese group. In the obese group, miR-424-5p expression was correlated with body mass index (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.582, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.018). miR-16 and miR-424 have shown correlations with body-fat-mass-related parameters. Because these miRNAs have vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors as target genes, they may be involved in the alterations of angiogenesis observed in obesity. In addition, higher levels of miR-27 and miR-424 were correlated with higher fat depot measurements in nonobese women. These results highlight the importance of miRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue and encourage further investigation of miRNAs as prognostic markers.</p>

<p>Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), a well-studied angiogenesis pathway, plays an essential role in angiogenesis-osteogenesis coupling. Targeting the HIF-1a pathway frequently leads to successful reconstruction of large-sized bone defects through promotion of angiogenesis. Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) small molecule regulates the stability of HIF-1a at normal oxygen tension by mimicking hypoxia, which subsequently accelerates angiogenesis. The current study aims to develop a novel construct by seeding adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) onto a scaffold that contains DMOG to induce angiogenesis and regeneration of a critical size calvarial defect in a rat model. The spongy scaffolds have been synthesized in the presence and absence of DMOG and analyzed in terms of morphology, porosity, pore size, mechanical properties and DMOG release profile. The effect of DMOG delivery on cellular behaviors of adhesion, viability, osteogenic differentiation, and angiogenesis were subsequently evaluated under in vitro conditions. Histological analysis of cell-scaffold constructs were also performed following transplantation into the calvarial defect. Physical characteristics of fabricated scaffolds confirmed higher mechanical strength and surface roughness of DMOG-loaded scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and MTT assay demonstrated the attachment and viability of ADMSCs in the presence of DMOG, respectively. Osteogenic activity of ADMSCs that included alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition significantly increased in the DMOG-loaded scaffold. Computed tomography (CT) imaging combined with histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry analysis showed enhanced bone formation and angiogenesis in the DMOG-loaded scaffolds. Therefore, spongy scaffolds that contained DMOG and had angiogenesis ability could be utilized to enhance bone regeneration of large-sized bone defects.</p>

<p>Endothelial-dependent atherosclerosis develops in a non-random pattern in regions of vessel bending and bifurcations, where blood flow exhibits disturbed flow (DF) patterns. In contrast, uniform flow (UF), normal endothelium, and healthy vessel walls co-exist within straight vessels. In clarifying how flow protectively or atherogenically regulates endothelial cell behavior, involvement of the endothelial surface glycocalyx has been suggested due to reduced expression in regions of atherosclerosis development. Here, we hypothesized that pro-atherosclerotic endothelial dysfunction occurs as a result of DF-induced reduction in glycocalyx expression and subsequently impairs endothelial sensitivity to flow. Specifically, we propose that glycocalyx degradation can induce pro-atherosclerotic endothelial dysfunction through decreased caveolin-1 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and localization.</AbstractText>: Endothelial-dependent atherosclerosis develops in a non-random pattern in regions of vessel bending and bifurcations, where blood flow exhibits disturbed flow (DF) patterns.

The effects of flow conditioning on endothelial cell behavior were quantified using immunocytochemistry. The glycocalyx was fluorescently labeled for wheat germ agglutinin, which serves as a general glycocalyx label, and heparan sulfate, a major glycocalyx component. Additionally, mechanosensitivity was assessed by immunocytochemical fluorescence expression and function of caveolin-1, the protein that forms the mechanosignaling caveolar invaginations on the endothelial surface, total endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which synthesizes nitric oxide, and serine 1177 phosphorylated eNOS (eNOS-pS1177), which is the active form of eNOS. Caveolin function and eNOS expression and activation were correlated to glycocalyx expression.

<p>OBJECTIVE: To investigate and further characterize the process of mature adipocyte dedifferentiation. Our hypothesis was that dedifferentiation does not involve mitosis but rather a phenomenon of liposecretion.METHODS: Mature adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of human adipose tissue samples. Ceiling cultures were established using our six-well plate model. Cells were treated with cytosine ß-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC) or vincristine (VCR), two agents blocking cell division, and were compared with vehicle. Liposecretion events were visualized by time-lapse microscopy, with and without AraC in adipocytes transducted with a baculovirus. Microscopic analyses were performed after labeling phosphorylated histone 3 and cyclin B1 in ceiling cultures.RESULTS: Treatment with AraC almost entirely prevented the formation of fibroblasts up to 12 days of ceiling culture. Similar results were obtained with VCR. The antimitotic effectiveness of the treatment was confirmed in fibroblast cultures from the adipose tissue stromal-vascular fraction by proliferation assays and colony-forming unit experiments. Using time-lapse microscopy, we visualized liposecretion events in which a large lipid droplet was rapidly secreted from isolated mature adipocytes. The same phenomenon was observed with AraC. This was observed in conjunction with histone 3 phosphorylation and cyclin B1 segregation to the nucleus.CONCLUSION: Our results support the notion that dedifferentiation involves rapid secretion of the lipid droplet by the adipocytes with concomitant generation of fibroblast-like cells that subsequently proliferate to generate the dedifferentiated adipocyte population during ceiling culture. The presence of mitotic markers suggests that this process involves cell cycle progression, although cell division does not occur.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue comprises one of the largest organs in the body and performs diverse functions including energy storage and release, regulation of appetite and other neuroendocrine signaling, and modulation of immuity, among others. Adipocytes reside in a complex compartment where antigen, antigen presenting cells, innate immune cells, and adaptive immune cells interact locally and exert systemic effects on inflammation, circulating immune cell profiles, and metabolic homeostasis. T lymphocytes are a major component of the adipose tissue milieu which are altered in disease states such as obesity and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. While obesity, HIV infection, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV; a non-human primate virus similar to HIV) infection are accompanied by enrichment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the adipose tissue, major phenotypic differences in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and other immune cell populations distinguish HIV/SIV infection from obesity. Furthermore, DNA and RNA species of HIV and SIV can be detected in the stromal vascular fraction of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and replication-competent HIV resides in local CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Here, we review studies of adipose tissue CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in HIV and SIV, and contrast the findings with those reported in obesity.</p>

<p>Cell-seeded scaffolds are a common route of cell transplantation for bladder repair and reconstruction. However, when cell suspensions are harvested, proteolytic enzymes often cause extracellular matrix damage and loss of intercellular junctions. To overcome this problem, we developed a bioengineered three-dimensional bladder patch comprising porous scaffolds and multilayered adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets, and evaluated its feasibility for bladder regeneration in a rat model. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were labeled with ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles. ASC patches were constructed using multilayered USPIO-labeled ASC sheets and porous polyglycolic acid scaffolds. To monitor the distribution and localization of bioengineered bladder patches in live animals, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 2<U+202F>weeks, 4<U+202F>weeks and 8<U+202F>weeks after transplantation. The bladder regenerative potential of ASC patches was further evaluated by urodynamic and histological analysis. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that cell sheets adhered tightly to the scaffold. MRI showed hypointense signals that lasted up to 8<U+202F>weeks at the site of USPIO-labeled ASC sheet transplants. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that these tissue-engineered bladder patches promoted regeneration of urothelium, smooth muscle, neural cells and blood vessels. Urodynamic testing revealed that the ASC patch restored bladder function with augmented capacity. The USPIO-labeled ASC patch provides a promising perspective on image-guided tissue engineering and holds great promise as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for bladder regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets avoid enzymatic dissociation and preserve the cell-to-cell interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which exhibit great potential for tissue regeneration. In this study, we developed a bioengineered three-dimensional bladder patch comprising porous scaffolds and multilayered ASC sheets, and evaluated its feasibility for bladder regeneration in a rat model. Tissue-engineered bladder patches restored bladder function and promoted regeneration of urothelium, smooth muscle, neural cells and blood vessels. Moreover, ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-labeled bladder patches can be dynamically monitored in vivo by noninvasive MRI for long periods of time. Therefore, The USPIO-labeled bladder patch provides a promising image-guided therapeutic strategy for bladder regeneration.</p>

<p>Blood flow regulation is a critical factor for tissue oxygenation and substrate supply. Increased reactivity of arteries to vasoconstrictors may increase vascular resistance, resulting in reduced blood flow. We aimed to investigate the effect of a high-fat (HF) diet on stiffness and vasoconstrictor reactivity of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) resistance arteries and also investigated the interconversion of both adipose depots in the setting of a HF diet. Vasoconstrictor reactivity and passive morphology and mechanical properties of arteries from B6D2F1 mice (5 mo old) fed normal chow (NC) or a HF diet (8 wk) were measured using pressure myography. Receptor gene expression in WAT and BAT arteries and markers of WAT and BAT were assessed in whole tissue lysates by real-time RT-PCR. Despite greater receptor-independent vasoconstriction (in response to KCl, P &lt; 0.01), vasoconstriction in response to angiotensin II ( P &lt; 0.01) was lower in NC-BAT than NC-WAT arteries and similar in response to endothelin-1 ( P = 0.07) and norepinephrine ( P = 0.11) in NC-BAT and NC-WAT arteries. With the exception of BAT artery reactivity to endothelin-1 and angiotensin II, the HF diet tended to attenuate reactivity in arteries from both adipose depots and increased expression of adipose markers in BAT. No significant differences in morphology or passive mechanical properties were found between adipose types or diet conditions. Alterations in gene expression of adipose markers after the HF diet suggest beiging of BAT. An increase in brown adipocytes in the absence of increased BAT mass may be a compensatory mechanism to dissipate excess energy from a HF diet. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Despite no differences in passive mechanical properties and greater receptor-independent vasoconstriction, receptor-mediated vasoconstriction was either lower in brown than white adipose tissue arteries or similar in brown and white adipose tissue arteries. A high-fat diet has a greater impact on vasoconstrictor responses in white adipose tissue but leads to altered adipose tissue gene expression consistent with beiging of the brown adipose tissue.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased obesity with a greater propensity to weight gain and a lack of sustainable lifestyle interventions. Altered brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is a potential contributor to obesity in PCOS. BAT activity and modulation have not been studied in PCOS. This observational study explored BAT thermogenesis and its associations in women with and without PCOS.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Cutaneous temperature was recorded from supraclavicular (indicator of BAT activity) and upper arm regions using dataloggers (SubCue, Calgary, Canada) in a cross-sectional substudy, nested within a randomized control trial, of community-recruited premenopausal women with (n = 47, Rotterdam diagnostic criteria) and without (n = 11) PCOS.RESULTS: Complete temperature data were available in 44 PCOS (mean age: 30.0 ± 6.2, mean BMI: 29.3 ± 5.5) and 11 non-PCOS (mean age: 33.0 ± 7.0, mean BMI: 25 ± 3) women. Women with PCOS had lower supraclavicular skin temperature compared to controls overall (33.9 ± 0.7 vs 34.5 ± 1, P &lt; 0.05) and during sleep (34.5 ± 0.6 vs 35.2 ± 0.9, P &lt; 0.001). In the PCOS group, supraclavicular skin temperature overall and over sleep and waking hours correlated inversely with testosterone (r = -0.41 P &lt; 0.05, r = -0.485 P &lt; 0.01 and r = -0.450 P &lt; 0.01 respectively). Testosterone levels explained approximately 15%, 30% and 20% of the variability in supraclavicular skin temperature overall and over sleep and waking hours in women with PCOS, respectively.CONCLUSION: Women with PCOS have lower BAT activity compared to controls. BAT thermogenesis is negatively associated with androgen levels in PCOS.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity, atherosclerosis, and obesity are all targets of clinical concern and vast research, as is the association between them. Aim of this study is to assess the impact of adipose tissue (including visceral and subcutaneous fat) on abdominal aorta calcification measured on non-enhanced computed tomography (CT). We retrospectively included 492 patients who underwent non-enhanced CT scans during workup for clinically suspected renal colic. All scans were reviewed for abdominal aorta calcification, liver attenuation, and thickness of visceral and subcutaneous fat. Multivariate general linear regression models were used to assess the association between abdominal aorta calcium score and adiposity measures. In the model that included only adiposity measures; visceral fat thickness had statistically significant direct association with abdominal aorta calcium score (B<U+200A>=<U+200A>67.1, P<U+200A>&lt;.001), whereas subcutaneous pelvic fat thickness had a significant inverse association with abdominal aorta calcium score (B<U+200A>=<U+200A>-22.34, P<U+200A>&lt;.001). Only the association of subcutaneous pelvic fat thickness with abdominal aorta calcium score remained statistically significant when controlling for age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia (B<U+200A>=<U+200A>-21.23, P<U+200A>&lt;.001). In this model, the association of visceral fat remained statistically significant in females (B<U+200A>=<U+200A>84.28, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.001) but not in males (B<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.47, P<U+200A>=<U+200A>.973). Visceral fat thickness and subcutaneous pelvic fat thickness were found to have opposing associations with abdominal aorta calcium score. This suggests that while visceral fat may have a lipotoxic effect on aortic atherosclerotic processes, subcutaneous pelvic fat may have a protective role in these processes.</p>

<p>A 62-years-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of chronic cough, expectoration of thick mucus, hoarseness and tightness in the precordial area. Computed Tomography (CT) examination revealed the presence of a giant intrapericardial tumor with the dimensions of 80 × 38 × 32 mm. It was located anteriorly and laterally to the left atrium, posteriorly to the pulmonary trunk and the ascending aorta. This hypodense change modeled the left atrium without evidence of invasion. CT coronary angiography and 3-dimensional reconstruction were applied to enable precise planning of cardiac surgery. CT evaluation confirmed that it is possible to remove the tumor without damage to the adjacent left main coronary artery. The patient underwent cardiac surgery with sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass. A cohesive, smooth, vascularized tumor pedunculated to the left atrial epicardium was visualized. The location and dimensions corresponded to those determined by CT scan examination. The entire tumor was successfully dissected together with adjacent adipose and fibrous tissue. Histological evaluation revealed the presence of myxoid cells, blood vessels, degenerative changes, and microcalcifications embedded in profuse hyalinized stroma. Those histological features enabled identification of the intrapericardial tumor as a myxoma. Follow-up CT examination did not demonstrate any signs of recurrence of the myxoma. According to our knowledge, a myxoma located inside the pericardial sac has never been described before.</p>

<p>Obesity is a global epidemic that poses a serious health concern due to it being a risk factor for life-threatening chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacotherapy remains the mainstay for the management of obesity; however, its usefulness is limited due to poor drug efficacy, non-specificity and toxic side effects. Therefore, novel approaches that could provide insights into obesity and obesity-associated diseases as well as development of novel anti-obesity treatment modalities or improvement on the existing drugs are necessary. While the ideal treatment of obesity should involve early intervention in susceptible individuals, targeted nanotherapy potentially provides a fresh perspective that might be better than the current conventional therapies. Independent studies have shown improved drug efficacy by using prohibitin (PHB)-targeted therapy in obese rodents and non-human primates, thus providing a proof of concept that targeted nanotherapy can be a feasible treatment for obesity. This review presents a brief global survey of obesity, its impact on human health, its current treatment and their limitations, and the role of angiogenesis and PHB in the development of obesity. Finally, the role and potential use of nanotechnology coupled with targeted drug delivery in the treatment of obesity are discussed.</p>

<p>Breath analysis offers a non-invasive and rapid diagnostic method for detecting various volatile organic compounds that could be indicators for different diseases, particularly metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely linked to metabolic dysfunction of adipose tissue and adipocytes. However, the VOC profile of human adipocytes has not yet been investigated. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection and head-space needle trap extraction (two-bed Carbopack X/Carboxen 1000 needle traps) were applied to profile VOCs produced and metabolised by human Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome adipocytes. In total, sixteen compounds were identified to be related to the metabolism of the cells. Four sulphur compounds (carbon disulphide, dimethyl sulphide, ethyl methyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide), three heterocyclic compounds (2-ethylfuran, 2-methyl-5-(methyl-thio)-furan, and 2-pentylfuran), two ketones (acetone and 2-pentanone), two hydrocarbons (isoprene and n-heptane) and one ester (ethyl acetate) were produced, and four aldehydes (2-methyl-propanal, butanal, pentanal and hexanal) were found to be consumed by the cells of interest. This study presents the first profile of VOCs formed by human adipocytes, which may reflect the activity of the adipose tissue enzymes and provide evidence of their active role in metabolic regulation. Our data also suggest that a previously reported increase of isoprene and sulphur compounds in diabetic patients may be explained by their production by adipocytes. Moreover, the unique features of this profile, including a high emission of dimethyl sulphide and the production of furan-containing VOCs, increase our knowledge about metabolism in adipose tissue and provide diagnostic potential for future applications.</p>

<p>Nicolau syndrome (NS) is a type of adverse skin reaction occurring after parenteral drug injection. In certain conditions, it can cause ischemic necrosis of the skin and the underlying adipose tissue. The actual cause of NS is not clear though inflammation, vasospasm, and thromboembolic occlusion of blood vessels have been proposed. In this case presentation, we report an interesting case of a 30-year-old man who turned out be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive on investigations, developed extensive purpuric lesions of his skin on left buttock and then spread to the trunk and shoulders after receiving intramuscular injection of paracetamol. With a suggestive history and further supported by clinical examination, a diagnosis of NS following injection of paracetamol was made. Though NS is considered to be rare, at times it can be devastating. Being a common procedure in the life of a health-care professional, the awareness regarding this entity is very essential. Despite intense medical literature search in, we could not find a single report of NS after intramuscular injection of paracetamol in a patient who is HIV positive, thus obliging this communication.</p>

<p>Non-swelling hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acrylate) network (cPnBA) is a candidate material for synthetic vascular grafts owing to its low toxicity and tailorable mechanical properties. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell type for accelerating endothelialization because of their superior anti-thrombosis and immune modulatory function. Further, they can differentiate into smooth muscle cells or endothelial-like cells and secret pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). MSCs are sensitive to the substrate mechanical properties, with the alteration of their major cellular behavior and functions as a response to substrate elasticity. Here, we cultured human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) on cPnBAs with different mechanical properties (cPnBA250, Young’s modulus (E)<U+200A>=<U+200A>250 kPa; cPnBA1100, E<U+200A>=<U+200A>1100 kPa) matching the elasticity of native arteries, and investigated their cellular response to the materials including cell attachment, proliferation, viability, apoptosis, senescence and secretion. The cPnBA allowed high cell attachment and showed negligible cytotoxicity. F-actin assembly of hADSCs decreased on cPnBA films compared to classical tissue culture plate. The difference of cPnBA elasticity did not show dramatic effects on cell attachment, morphology, cytoskeleton assembly, apoptosis and senescence. Cells on cPnBA250, with lower proliferation rate, had significantly higher VEGF secretion activity. These results demonstrated that tuning polymer elasticity to regulate human stem cells might be a potential strategy for constructing stem cell-based artificial blood vessels.</p>

<p>AIM: Obesity is a continually growing pandemic leading to many diseases that affect the overall quality of life. The widely marketed Garcinia cambogia (GC) and Raspberry ketone (RK) were used in this study. Despite their known dietetic effect, however, the metabolomic/signaling pathways involved in this effect are not fully elucidated. Hence, our study comprehends the possible trajectories of their combination against obesity and insulin resistance in addition to exploring their combination merit.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups; viz., normal diet (ND), high fat fructose diet (HFFD), HFFD+GC (600mg/kg), HFFD+RK (55mg/kg) and HFFD+GC+RK. To assess our aim, we determined their effect on body weight, IPGTT, glucose homeostasis (glucose, insulin, HOMA IR), lipid profile parameters and SREBP-1c, oxidative stress markers, insulin and leptin signaling pathways (p-IRS-1/p-AKT/GLUT-4, and leptin/STAT-3), as well as liver and adipose tissue histopathology.RESULTS: GC/RK combinationcaused weight loss, corrected the disturbed glucose and insulin homeostasis, raised serum levels of HDL anddecreased all other lipid profile parameters. They also increased Nrf-2 expression, ad GSH, as well as p-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4 cue, while they decreased MDA, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c content compared to the HFFD group. Furthermore, the GC/RK combination abolished apoptosis, fatty changes and inflammation in hepatocytes and decreased sclerotic blood vessels and congestion in adipose tissue.CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the involvement ofp-IRS-1/p-Akt/GLUT-4, leptin/STAT-3 and SREBP-1c signaling trajectories in the beneficial combination of GC and RK, besides, the efficient rebalance of the redox status, insulin resistance and tissue fat deposition confirmed histopathologically.</p>

<p>Angiogenesis is a crucial process for the maintenance of normal tissue physiology and it is involved in tissue remodeling and regeneration. This process is essential for adipose tissue maintenance. The adipose tissue is composed by different cell types including stromal vascular cells as well as adipose stem cells (ASCs). In particular, ASCs are multipotent somatic stem cells that are able to differentiate and secrete several growth factors; they are recently emerging as a new cell reservoir for novel therapies and strategies in many diseases. Several studies suggest that ASCs have peculiar properties and participate in different disease-related processes such as angiogenesis. Furthermore, pathological expansion of adipose tissue brings to hypoxia, a major condition of unhealthy angiogenesis. Recent evidences have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role also on ASCs as they take part in stemness maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation. It has been suggested that some miRNAs (MIR126, MIR31, MIR221 MIR222, MIR17-92 cluster, MIR30, MIR100 and MIR486) are directly involved in the angiogenic process by controlling multiple genes involved in this pathway. With the present review, we aim at providing an updated summary of the importance of adipose tissue under physiological and pathological conditions and of its relationship with neovascularization process. In particular, we report an overview of the most important miRNAs involved in angiogenesis focusing on ASCs. Hopefully the data presented will bring benefit in developing new therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>RESULTS: We found no association between BMD and cold-induced BAT volume, mean, and maximal activity (all P<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>0.1) in neither young and healthy men nor women. These results remained unchanged when adjusting by height, by body composition, and by objectively assessed physical activity. Sensitivity analyses using the criteria to quantify cold-induced BAT-related parameters applied in previous studies did not change the results.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study shows that there is no association between cold-induced BAT and BMD in young healthy adults. Moreover, our data support the notion that previously shown associations between BAT and BMD in healthy non-calorically restricted individuals, could be driven by methodological issues related to BAT assessment and/or sample size limitations.</p>

<p>Soft tissue generation, especially in large tissue, is a major challenge in reconstructive surgery to treat congenital deformities, posttraumatic repair, and cancer rehabilitation. The concern is along with the donor site morbidity, donor tissue shortage, and flap necrosis. Here, we report a dissection-free adipose tissue chamber-based novel guided adipose tissue regeneration strategy in a bioreactor of elastic gelatin cryogel and polydopamine-assisted platelet immobilization intended to improve angiogenesis and generate large adipose tissue in situ. In order to have matched tissue mechanics, we used 5% gelatin cryogel as growth substrate of bioreactor. Platelets from the platelet-rich plasma were then immobilized onto the gelatin cryogel with the aid of polydopamine to form a biomimetic bioreactor (polydopamine/gelatin cryogel/platelet). Platelets on the substrate led to a sustained high release in both platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor compared with non-polydopamine-assisted group. The formed bioreactor was then transferred to a tissue engineering chamber and then inserted above inguinal fat pad of rats without flap dissection. This integrate strategy significantly boomed the vessel density, stimulated cellular proliferation, and upregulated macrophage infiltration. There was a noticeable rise in the expression of dual-angiogenic growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor) in chamber fluid; host cell migration and host fibrous protein secretion coordinated with gelatin cryogel degradation. The regenerated adipose tissue volume gained threefold larger than control group (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05) with less fibrosis tissue. These results indicate that a big well-vascularized three-dimensional mature adipose tissue can be regenerated using elastic gel, polydopamine, platelets, and small fat tissue.</p>

<p>Adipokines are biologically active cytokines that are mainly produced in adipose tissue. There is evidence, in man and mice, that some adipokines may be secreted in other tissues including the vascular endothelium, epithelia and sebaceous glands. Moreover, modified serum levels of adipokines have been detected in people with acne vulgaris or psoriasis; it is suspected that adipokines could contribute to local and systemic inflammatory conditions. We aimed to evaluate the expression of three adipokines (i.e. leptin, adiponectin and resistin) in normal canine skin. Formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded punch biopsy samples were obtained from the sparsely-haired skin of the caudal ventral abdomen of a single clinically healthy dog with no history of skin disease. Immunohistochemistry was applied, using rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies specific for leptin, adiponectin and resistin. Adipokines were not expressed in normal canine dermis or hypodermis. In contrast, they were detected in the keratinocytes of all epidermal layers and hair follicle segments, sebocytes, apocrine gland cells and in the vascular endothelium. This is the first report on the expression of adipokines in normal canine skin, a first step in studying their role in the skin physiology and inflammatory skin diseases of dogs.</p>

<p>Unilateral lower extremity edema below the knee commonly results from deep venous thrombosis, venous insufficiency, or lymphedema. The patient history, a physical examination, and lower extremity venous duplex ultrasound often reveal the underlying etiology, which is frequently of vascular origin. Presently described is the case of a 23-year-old patient who underwent a diagnostic workup for unilateral leg swelling and was found to have a relatively uncommon cause of edema: lipedema. Lipedema is a disease characterized by subcutaneous adipose tissue deposition, and although diagnosed very rarely in general cardiology outpatient clinics, it has been demonstrated to be a cause of lower extremity edema in approximately one-fifth of cases in specialized clinics.</p>

<p>Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major constituent of the tumor microenvironment, although their origin and roles in shaping disease initiation, progression and treatment response remain unclear due to significant heterogeneity. Here, following a negative selection strategy combined with single-cell RNA sequencing of 768 transcriptomes of mesenchymal cells from a genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer, we define three distinct subpopulations of CAFs. Validation at the transcriptional and protein level in several experimental models of cancer and human tumors reveal spatial separation of the CAF subclasses attributable to different origins, including the peri-vascular niche, the mammary fat pad and the transformed epithelium. Gene profiles for each CAF subtype correlate to distinctive functional programs and hold independent prognostic capability in clinical cohorts by association to metastatic disease. In conclusion, the improved resolution of the widely defined CAF population opens the possibility for biomarker-driven development of drugs for precision targeting of CAFs.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major cause of mortality in type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM). The causes are embedded in a complex interplay between excess body fat, insulin resistance and serum lipid anomalies. Endothelial homeostasis is strongly affected by this pathogenic network. Even though metabolic changes and weight loss improve vascular endothelial function, the effect of different dietary approaches is still uncertain for type 2 diabetes patients.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the acute effects of a hypocaloric very low carbohydrate (VLC) diet versus a hypocaloric low fat (LF) diet on flow mediated dilation (FMD), intrahepatic lipid (IHL) accumulation and visceral adipose tissue as independent risk factors of CVD in T2DM patients.DESIGN: 36 T2DM patients (age 63 ± 8 years, 60% females) were randomly assigned to the VLC diet (4<U+207B>10% of total energy intake (E)) or to the LF diet (&lt;30% E) for 3 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed by the flow mediated dilation (FMD) method. Adipose tissue depots and IHL were determined by magnetic resonance.RESULTS: Both dietary strategies reduced body weight, body fat content and IHL. Unexpectedly, the LF group experienced significantly greater enhancement of FMD, compared to the VLC group. The FMD showed a positive correlation with protein intake and fat intake in the LF group, while it revealed a negative correlation with protein intake in the VLC diet group.CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of total and hepatic adiposity was shown to be successful using either the VLC or LF hypocaloric diets, however, improvements in FMD may be related to the interplay of fat and protein intake.</p>

<p>Soft-tissue deficits in amputation stumps can lead to significant pain and disability. An emerging treatment option is stem cell-enriched fat grafting. This is the first study assessing the potential for this treatment modality in lower extremity amputation sites. In this prospective cohort study, five injured military personnel suffering from pain and limited function at amputation sites were recruited. Fat grafting enriched with stromal vascular fraction was performed at amputation sites to provide additional subcutaneous tissue padding over bony structures. Outcomes measures included complications, demographic data, physical examination, cellular subpopulations, cell viability, graft volume retention, pain, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, Functional Mobility Assessment, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and rates of depression. Follow-up was 2 years. There were no significant complications. Volume retention was 61.5 ± 24.0 percent. Overall cell viability of the stromal vascular fraction was significantly correlated with volume retention (p = 0.016). There was no significant correlation between percentage of adipose-derived stem cells or number of cells in the stromal vascular fraction and volume retention. There was a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in pain scores (3.0 ± 2.5 to 1.2 ± 1.6; p = 0.180 at 2 years). There were no significant changes in disability indexes. Results from this pilot study demonstrate that stromal vascular fraction-enriched fat grafting is a safe, novel modality for the treatment of symptomatic soft-tissue defects in traumatic lower extremity amputations. Volume retention can be anticipated at slightly over 60 percent. Further studies are needed to assess efficacy. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Therapeutic, IV.</p>

<p>Impaired angiogenesis is a hallmark of metabolically dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms restricting angiogenesis within this context remain ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate that induced endothelial-specific depletion of the transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) in male mice led to increased vascular density in adipose tissue. Upon high-fat diet feeding, endothelial cell FoxO1-deficient mice exhibited even greater vascular remodeling in the visceral adipose depot, which was paralleled with a healthier adipose tissue expansion, higher glucose tolerance and lower fasting glycemia concomitant with enhanced lactate levels. Mechanistically, FoxO1 depletion increased endothelial proliferative and glycolytic capacities by upregulating the expression of glycolytic markers, which may account for the improvements at the tissue level ultimately impacting whole-body glucose metabolism. Altogether, these findings reveal the pivotal role of FoxO1 in controlling endothelial metabolic and angiogenic adaptations in response to high-fat diet and a contribution of the endothelium to whole-body energy homeostasis.</p>

This was the result of interstitial, vessel and tubular cell engraftment leading to tubular and vessel regeneration, decreased tubular cells apoptosis and mitigated pro-inflammatory milieu. Reduction of NGLA-MMP9 complexes mainly due to decrease MMPs activity prevented further negative heart remodeling.</p>

<p>Regenerative cell therapies are emerging as promising treatments for numerous musculoskeletal conditions, including knee osteoarthritis (OA). Adipose-derived stem cells and possibly other adipose-based therapies have a greater chondrogenic potential than stem cells derived from bone marrow, and thus a lot of attention is being placed on them as potential regenerative agents in the treatment of knee OA. Several types of adipose-based therapies have good basic science and preclinical data supporting their translation to human therapeutic intervention. Cultured, adipose-derived stem cells appear to be good source of bioactive cells with convenient accessibility, relative abundance, and well-documented regenerative capacity. Non-culture expanded adipose-based therapy, in the forms of stromal vascular fraction and most recently micronized adipose tissue (MAT), have been utilized in patients to treat OA and other cartilage abnormalities with encouraging preliminary data. These adipose-based therapies have shown a lot of therapeutic potential; however, because of the regulatory restrictions on enzymatic isolation and cell expansion, only MAT is currently available in clinical practice in the United States. While no serious adverse reactions have been reported, adipose-derived therapies also have the potential for adverse reactions including inflammation and infection. The current review provides an update on the latest research and presents this evidence on the therapeutic potential of adipose-based therapies in the treatment of knee OA.</p>

<p>Leptin influences inflammation and immune response. Dose-dependent effects of leptin on biomarkers of inflammation have not been studied in vivo, so far. Leptin-deficient low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) knockout (LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> ;ob/ob) female mice were treated with three different leptin doses or saline for 12 weeks. The effect of leptin on plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 concentrations and Il-6 and Mcp-1 mRNA expression in vivo were assessed. Macrophage infiltration in epididymal adipose tissue (epiAT) after leptin treatment was determined by quantitative immunohistochemical analysis. Aortic root atherosclerotic lesions were analyzed by oil red O staining. Mean plasma IL-6 and MCP-1 decreased significantly in the 3.0 mg/kg BW/day group as compared to control mice (both P &lt; 0.01). Messenger RNA expression of Il-6 and Mcp-1 was significantly down-regulated by leptin treatment in different adipose tissues in vivo. Characteristic crown-like structures formed by adipose tissue macrophages were significantly reduced by leptin treatment in epiAT. Recombinant leptin dose-dependently diminished plaque area in the aortic root. Leptin administration within the subphysiological to physiological range diminishes circulating pro-inflammatory IL-6 and MCP-1. Reduction of Il-6 and Mcp-1 gene expression in adipose tissue, as well as decreased adipose tissue macrophage infiltration might contribute. © 2018 BioFactors, 45(1):43-48, 2019.</p>

<p>Browning of white adipose tissue has been proven to be a potential target to fight against obesity and its metabolic commodities, making the exploration of molecules involved in browning process important. Among those browning agents reported recently, FGF21 play as a quite promising candidate for treating obesity for its obvious enhancement of thermogenic capacity in adipocyte and significant improvement of metabolic disorders in both mice and human. However, whether other members of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family play roles in adipose thermogenesis and obese development is still an open question. Here, we examined the mRNA expression of all FGF family members in three adipose tissues of male C57BL/6 mice and found that FGF9 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and decreased under cold stress. Furthermore, FGF9 treatment inhibited thermogenic genes in the process of beige adipocytes differentiation from stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with FGF9 overexpression. Consistently, knockdown of FGF9 in SVF cells by using lentiviral shRNA increased thermogenic genes in differentiated beige adipocytes. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant increment of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway in the early stage of beige adipocytes differentiation under FGF9 treatment, which was validated by real-time PCR. FGF9 expression was increased in subcutaneous WAT of obese human and mice. This study shows that adipose-derived FGF9 play as an inhibitory role in the browning of white adipocytes. Activation of hypoxia signaling at early stage of adipose browning process may contribute to this anti-thermogenic effect of FGF9.</p>

<p>Insulin was discovered in 1922 by Banting and Best. Since that time, extensive research on the mechanisms of insulin activity and action has continued. Currently, it is known that the role of insulin is much greater than simply regulating carbohydrate metabolism. Insulin in physiological concentration is also necessary to maintain normal vascular function. Insulin resistance is defined as a pathological condition characterized by reduced sensitivity of skeletal muscles, liver, and adipose tissue, to insulin and its downstream metabolic effects under normal serum glucose concentrations. There are also selective forms of insulin resistance with unique features, including vascular insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, both classical and vascular, contributes to vascular impairment resulting in increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in the elderly population, additional factors including redistribution of fat concentrations, low-grade inflammation, and decreased self-repair capacity [or cell senescence] amplify the vascular abnormalities related to insulin resistance.</p>

<p>While many studies have characterized the inflammatory disposition of adipose tissue (AT) during obesity, far fewer have dissected how such inflammation resolves during the process of physiological weight loss. In addition, new immune cells, such as the eosinophil, have been discovered as part of the AT immune cell repertoire. We have therefore characterized how AT eosinophils, associated eosinophilic inflammation, and remodeling processes, fluctuate during a dietary intervention in obese mice. Similar to previous reports, we found that obesity induced by high-fat diet feeding reduced the AT eosinophil content. However, upon switching obese mice to a low fat diet, AT eosinophils were restored to lean levels as mice reached the body weight of controls. The rise in AT eosinophils during dietary weight loss was accompanied by reduced macrophage content and inflammatory expression, upregulated tissue remodeling factors, and a more uniformly distributed AT vascular network. Additionally, we show that eosinophils of another metabolically relevant tissue, the liver, did not oscillate with either dietary weight gain or weight loss. This study shows that eosinophil content is differentially regulated among tissues during the onset and resolution of obesity. Furthermore, AT eosinophils correlated with AT remodeling processes during weight loss and thus may play a role in reestablishing AT homeostasis.</p>

<p>Excessive phosphate intake has been positively associated with renal and vascular dysfunction, conversely negatively associated with body fat accumulation. We investigated the effect of a high-phosphate diet on the expression of lipid metabolic genes in white adipose tissue and liver. Male 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control diet containing 0.6% phosphate or a high-phosphate diet containing 1.5% phosphate for 4 weeks. In comparison to the control group, the HP group showed a significantly lower body fat mass and fasting plasma insulin level alongside decreased lipogenic and increased lipolytic gene expression in visceral fat. Additionally, the expression of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis, hepatic glycogenesis, and triglyceride accumulation decreased in the high-phosphate group. Exogenous phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23 did not directly affect the expression of lipolytic or lipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and HepG2 hepatocytes. Thus, the high-phosphate diet suppressed the activity of white adipose tissue by increasing lipolytic gene expression and decreasing lipogenic gene expression. These effects could have been caused by the lowered fasting plasma insulin level that occurred in response to the high-phosphate diet, but were not directly caused by the increases in plasma phosphate or phosphaturic hormones.</p>

<p>The enhancement of adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and sufficient vascularization remain great challenges for the successful reconstruction of engineered adipose tissue. Here, the bioactive effects of silicon (Si) ions on adipogenic differentiation of human BMSCs (HBMSCs) and the stimulation of vascularization during adipose tissue regeneration are reported. The results show that Si ions can enhance adipogenic differentiation of HBMSCs through the stimulation of the expression of adipogenic differentiation switches such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein a. Furthermore, Si ions can enhance both angiogenesis and adipogenesis, and inhibit dedifferentiation of cocultured adipocytes by regulating the interactions between HBMSC-derived adipocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, in which the promotion of the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor plays vital roles. The in vivo studies further demonstrate that the designed composite hydrogel with the ability to release bioactive Si ions clearly stimulates neovascularization and adipose tissue regeneration. The study suggests that Si ions released from biomaterials are important chemical cues for adipogenic differentiation and biomaterials with the ability to release Si ions can be designed for adipose tissue engineering.</p>

<p>Activation of brown adipose tissue-mediated thermogenesis is a strategy for tackling obesity and promoting metabolic health. BMP8b is secreted by brown/beige adipocytes and enhances energy dissipation. Here we show that adipocyte-secreted BMP8b contributes to adrenergic-induced remodeling of the neuro-vascular network in adipose tissue (AT). Overexpression of bmp8b in AT enhances browning of the subcutaneous depot and maximal thermogenic capacity. Moreover, BMP8b-induced browning, increased sympathetic innervation and vascularization of AT were maintained at 28<U+2009>°C, a condition of low adrenergic output. This reinforces the local trophic effect of BMP8b. Innervation and vascular remodeling effects required BMP8b signaling through the adipocytes to 1) secrete neuregulin-4 (NRG4), which promotes sympathetic axon growth and branching in vitro, and 2) induce a pro-angiogenic transcriptional and secretory profile that promotes vascular sprouting. Thus, BMP8b and NRG4 can be considered as interconnected regulators of neuro-vascular remodeling in AT and are potential therapeutic targets in obesity.</p>

<p>AIMS: Obesity is characterized by the immune activation that eventually dampens insulin sensitivity and changes metabolism. This study explores the impact of different inflammatory/ anti-inflammatory paradigms on the expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) found in adipocyte cultures, adipose tissue, and blood.METHODS: We evaluated by real time PCR the impact of acute surgery stress in vivo (adipose tissue) and macrophages (MCM) in vitro (adipocytes). Weight loss was chosen as an anti-inflammatory model, so TLR were analyzed in fat samples collected before and after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss. Associations with inflammatory and metabolic parameters were analyzed in non-obese and obese subjects, in parallel with gene expression measures taken in blood and isolated adipocytes/ stromal-vascular cells (SVC). Treatments with an agonist of TLR3 were conducted in human adipocyte cultures under normal conditions and upon conditions that simulated the chronic low-grade inflammatory state of obesity.RESULTS: Surgery stress raised TLR1 and TLR8 in subcutaneous (SAT), and TLR2 in SAT and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue, while decreasing VAT TLR3 and TLR4. MCM led to increased TLR2 and diminished TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5 expressions in human adipocytes. The anti-inflammatory impact of weight loss was concomitant with decreased TLR1, TLR3, and TLR8 in SAT. Cross-sectional associations confirmed increased V/ SAT TLR1 and TLR8, and decreased TLR3 in obese patients, as compared with non-obese subjects. As expected, TLR were predominant in SVC and adipocyte precursor cells, even though expression of all of them but TLR8 (very low levels) was also found in ex vivo isolated and in vitro differentiated adipocytes. Among SVC, CD14+ macrophages showed increased TLR1, TLR2, and TLR7, but decreased TLR3 mRNA. The opposite patterns shown for TLR2 and TLR3 in V/ SAT, SVC, and inflamed adipocytes were observed in blood as well, being TLR3 more likely linked to lymphocyte instead of neutrophil counts. On the other hand, decreased TLR3 in adipocytes challenged with MCM dampened lipogenesis and the inflammatory response to Poly(I:C).CONCLUSION: Functional variations in the expression of TLR found in blood and hypertrophied fat depots, namely decreased TLR3 in lymphocytes and inflamed adipocytes, are linked to metabolic inflammation.</p>

<p>The seeding of scaffolds with the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue is a common prevascularization strategy in tissue engineering.

Non-seeded matrices served as controls. While both isolates contained a comparable fraction of endothelial cells, perivascular cells, adipocytes and stem cells, ad-MVF exhibited a significantly higher viability. After in vivo implantation, the vascularization of ad-MVF-seeded scaffolds was improved when compared to SVF-seeded ones, as indicated by a significantly higher functional microvessel density. This was associated with an enhanced cellular infiltration, collagen content and density of CD31<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>+</sup> microvessels particularly in the center of the implants, demonstrating a better incorporation into the surrounding host tissue.

<p>Diabesity is an abnormal metabolic condition shown by patients with obesity that develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabesity present with insulin resistance, reduced vascular response to insulin, and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Along with the several well-described mechanisms of insulin resistance, a state of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, where the primary human targets are the adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and the foetoplacental vasculature, is apparent. ER stress characterises by the activation of the unfolded protein response via three canonical ER stress sensors, i.e., the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (IRE1a), and activating transcription factor 6. Slightly different cell signalling mechanisms preferentially enable in diabesity in the ER stress-associated insulin resistance for adipose tissue (IRE1a/X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing/c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 activation), skeletal muscle (tribbles-like protein 3 (TRB3)/proinflammatory cytokines activation), and liver (PERK/activating transcription factor 4/TRB3 activation). There is no information in human subjects with diabesity in the foetoplacental vasculature. However, the available literature shows that pregnant women with pre-pregnancy obesity or overweight that develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and their newborn show insulin resistance. ER stress is recently reported to be triggered in endothelial cells from the human umbilical vein from mothers with pre-pregnancy obesity. However, whether a different metabolic alteration to obesity in pregnancy or GDM is present in women with pre-pregnancy obesity that develop GDM, is unknown. In this review, we summarised the findings on diabesity-associated mechanisms of insulin resistance with emphasis in the primary targets adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, and foetoplacental tissues. We also give evidence on the possibility of a new GDM-associated metabolic condition triggered in pregnancy by maternal obesity, i.e. gestational diabesity, leading to ER stress-associated insulin resistance in the human foetoplacental vasculature.</p>

Seventeen articles were included and analyzed, showing that there is overall a lack of high-quality evidence concerning the use of ASCs. Most trials are case series with short-term evaluation. The most adopted approach consists of an intra-articular injection of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) rather than the expanded cells. Based on the available data, no specific preparation method or formulation could be considered as the preferred choice in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Finding genetic variants that cause functional disruption or regulatory change among the many implicated GWAs variants remains a key challenge to translating the findings from GWAs to therapeutic treatments. Defining the causal mechanisms behind the variants require functional screening experiments that can be complex and costly. Prioritizing variants for functional characterization using techniques that capture important functional and regulatory elements can assist this. The genetic architecture of complex traits such as cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes comprise an enormously large number of variants of small effect contributing to heritability and spread throughout the genome. This makes it difficult to distinguish which variants or core genes are most relevant for prioritization and how they contribute to the regulatory networks that become dysregulated leading to disease. Despite these challenges, recent GWAs for CAD prioritized genes associated with lipid metabolism, coagulation and adhesion along with novel signals related to innate immunity, adipose tissue and, vascular function as important core drivers of risk. We focus on three examples of novel signals associated with CAD which affect risk through missense or UTR mutations indicating their potential for therapeutic modification. These variants play roles in adipose tissue function vascular function and innate immunity which form the cornerstones of immuno-metabolism. In addition we have explored the putative, but potentially important interactions between the environment, specifically food and nutrition, with respect to key processes.</p>

<p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) improves insulin resistance of adipose tissue in obese humans. However, the mechanism of this effect is unclear. Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis impairs insulin signaling. We hypothesized that GLP-1 could directly improve insulin signaling in ER-stressed adipocytes. Here, we examined the effects of GLP-1 on ER stress response in fat cells in an obese and insulin-resistant murine model. We found that GLP-1 analog liraglutide reduced ER stress related gene expression in visceral fat cells accompanied by improved systemic insulin tolerance. Consistently, GLP-1 decreased CHOP expression and increased insulin stimulated AKT phosphorylation (p-AKT) in thapsigargin, a ER stress inducer, treated white fat cells differentiated from visceral stromal vascular fraction. We further found blocking CHOP expression increased insulin stimulated p-AKT in ER-stressed fat cells. Of note, we found mTOR signaling pathway contributed to the expression of ATF4 and subsequently the CHOP expression in ER stress response, while GLP-1 inhibited mTOR activity as exemplified by elevated autophagosome formation and increased LC3II/LC3I ratio. These findings suggest that GLP-1 directly modulates the ER stress response partially via inhibiting mTOR signaling pathway, leading to increased insulin sensitivity in adipocytes.</p>

<p>Visceral adiposity is associated with cardiovascular disease, an association that may be mediated in part by inflammation. We hypothesized that regional measures of visceral adiposity would associate with commonly obtained clinical measures of immune status. We consecutively studied 3,291 subjects (mean age, 49.8±9.8 years) who underwent an annual cardiovascular risk survey. Peri-cardial (PCF) and thoracic peri-aortic adipose tissue (TAT) volumes were determined by dedicated computed tomography (CT) software (Aquarius 3D Workstation, TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA, USA). Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasonography. We explored cross-sectional associations between visceral fat measures and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), leukocyte counts, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ration (NLR). Among 3,291 study participants, we observed positive linear associations between PCF and TAT, higher degree of hepatic steatosis and hs-CRP, various leukocyte counts, either total and its differential counts, and NLR (all trend p&lt;0.001). Multi-variate linear and logistic regression models showed independent associations between PCF/TAT (ß-Coef: 0.14/0.16, both p&lt;0.05) and total WBC counts, with only TAT further demonstrated significant relations with neutrophil counts and NLR (both p&lt;0.05) and independently identified abnormally high WBC and NLR (Odds ratio: 1.18 &amp; 1.21, both p&lt;0.05). C-statistics showed significant incremental model prediction for abnormally high WBC and NLR (both <U+0394>AUROC&lt;0.05) when TAT was superimposed on traditional cardiovascular risks and biochemical information. Greater visceral adiposity burden and hepatic steatosis may be associated with higher circulating leukocyte counts and markers for atherosclerosis, with more pronounced influences for peri-aortic adiposity. Our data suggested the differential biological impacts for region-specific visceral adiposity.</p>

<p>Seipin deficiency is responsible for type 2 congenital generalized lipodystrophy with severe loss of adipose tissue and can lead to hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance (IR), and dyslipidemia in humans. Adipose tissue secretes many adipokines that are central to the regulation of metabolism. In this study, we investigated whether transplantation of normal adipose tissue could ameliorate severe hepatic steatosis, IR, and dyslipidemia in lipoatrophic seipin knockout (SKO) mice. Normal adipose tissue from wild-type mice was transplanted into 6-wk-old SKO mice. At 4 mo after adipose tissue transplantation (AT), the transplanted fat survived with detectable blood vessels, and the reduced levels of plasma leptin, a major adipokine, were dramatically increased. Severe hepatic steatosis, IR, and dyslipidemia in SKO mice were ameliorated after AT. In addition, abnormal hepatic lipogenesis and ß-oxidation gene expression in SKO mice were improved after AT. Our results suggest that AT may be an effective treatment to improve lipodystrophy-associated metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: To provide a systematic review of the clinical literature reporting the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in terms of clinical outcomes including pain and function and cartilage repair in patients with osteoarthritis.METHODS: We systematically reviewed any studies investigating clinical outcomes and cartilage repair after the clinical application of cell populations containing MSCs in human subjects with knee osteoarthritis through MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Studies with a level of evidence of IV or V were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score. Clinical outcomes were assessed using clinical scores, and cartilage repair was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging and second-look arthroscopy findings.RESULTS: A total of 17 studies that met the criteria of 50 full-text studies were included in this review, with 6 randomized controlled trials, 8 prospective observational studies, and 3 retrospective case-control studies. Among 17 studies, 8 studies used bone marrow-derived MSCs, 6 used adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction, 2 used adipose tissue-derived MSCs, and 1 used umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs. All studies except 2 reported significantly better clinical outcomes in the MSC group or improved clinical outcomes at final follow-up. In terms of cartilage repair, 9 of 11 studies reported improvement of the cartilage state on magnetic resonance imaging, and 6 of 7 studies reported repaired tissue on second-look arthroscopy. The mean Modified Coleman Methodology Score was 55.5 ± 15.5 (range, 28-74).CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular MSCs provide improvements in pain and function in knee osteoarthritis at short-term follow-up (&lt;28 months) in many cases. Some efficacy has been shown of MSCs for cartilage repair in osteoarthritis; however, the evidence of efficacy of intra-articular MSCs on both clinical outcomes and cartilage repair remains limited.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III; systematic review of level I, II, and III studies.</p>

<p>Adiponectin is the most important adipokine secreted by the adipose tissue. It carries out an important role in setting up the metabolism and improving the function of various organs. Adiponectin in the kidneys prevents degradation of the renal arteries, reduces protein excretion, and improves filtration. This role is accomplished by regulating anabolic pathways and reducing oxidative stress in the renal tissue. This hormone in the liver prevents the accumulation of fat and free radicals that cause damage to liver cells and tissue. This adipokine, by preventing inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, obesity and insulin resistance, improves vascular function and prevents the development of atherosclerosis. It seems that adiponectin can also be a therapeutic target for many metabolic diseases. This study aims to clarify the adipose tissue discharge. Here, the diverse physiological actions of adiponectin were reviewed to provide an overview of its therapeutic potential in different metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>Thoracic aorta perivascular adipose tissue (T-PVAT) has critical roles in regulating vascular homeostasis. However, the developmental characteristics and cellular lineage of adipocyte in the T-PVAT remain unclear. We show that T-PVAT contains three long strip-shaped fat depots, anterior T-PVAT (A-T-PVAT), left lateral T-PVAT (LL-T-PVAT), and right lateral T-PVAT (RL-T-PVAT). A-T-PVAT displays a distinct transcriptional profile and developmental origin compared to the two lateral T-PVATs (L-T-PVAT). Lineage tracing studies indicate that A-T-PVAT adipocytes are primarily derived from SM22a<sup>+</sup> progenitors, whereas L-T-PVAT contains both SM22a<sup>+</sup> and Myf5<sup>+</sup> cells. We also show that L-T-PVAT contains more UCP1<sup>+</sup> brown adipocytes than A-T-PVAT, and L-T-PVAT exerts a greater relaxing effect on aorta than A-T-PVAT. Angiotensin II-infused hypertensive mice display greater macrophage infiltration into A-T-PVAT than L-T-PVAT. These combined results indicate that L-T-PVAT has a distinct development from A-T-PVAT with different cellular lineage, and suggest that L-T-PVAT and A-T-PVAT have different physiological and pathological functions.</p>

<p>Large and complex bone defects represent challenging clinical scenarios, typically requiring autologous vascularized bone transplants. In order to bypass the numerous associated limitations, here we aimed at ectopically prefabricating a bone graft surrogate with vascular pedicle. A hollow cylinder of devitalized cancellous bone was used to define the space of a large bone substitute. This space was filled with devitalized pellets of engineered hypertrophic cartilage as bone-inducing material, in combination or not with stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue as source of osteoprogenitors and endothelial cells. Vascularization of the space was targeted through axial insertion of an arterio-venous (AV) bundle. Constructs were subcutaneously implanted in nude rats for 12 weeks and analyzed for bone formation and vascularization by histology and microtomography. Retrieved constructs were extensively vascularized in all conditions, with vessels sprouting from the AV bundle and reaching a higher density in the axially central volume. Bone tissue was formed through remodeling of hypertrophic cartilage, and quantitatively correlated with de novo vascularization. Our study demonstrates feasibility to prefabricate large, pedicled bone grafts in predefined shapes. The combination of an AV bundle with engineered hypertrophic cartilage provided a germ for the coupled processes of vascularization and bone formation. The demonstrated osteoinductivity of devitalized hypertrophic cartilage offers the opportunity of implementing the proposed regenerative surgery strategy through off-the-shelf materials.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Proteoglycan 4 (Prg4) has emerged from human association studies as a possible factor contributing to weight gain, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. In the current study, we investigated the causal role of Prg4 in controlling lipid and glucose metabolism in mice.METHODS: Prg4 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were challenged with an obesogenic high-fat diet (45% of total calories as fat) for 16<U+202F>weeks. To further stimulate the development of metabolic alterations, 10% fructose water was provided starting from week 13.RESULTS: Prg4 deficiency only tended to reduce diet-induced body weight gain, but significantly improved glucose handling (AUC: -29%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05), which was also reflected by a tendency towards a reduced HOMA-IR score (-49%; p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.06 as compared to WT mice). This coincided with lower hepatic expression of glycolysis (Gck: -30%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05) and lipogenesis (Acc: -21%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05 and Scd1: -38%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001) genes, which translated in significantly lower hepatic triglyceride levels (-56%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001) in Prg4 KO mice as compared to WT mice. Prg4 KO mice likely had lower glucose utilization by skeletal muscle as compared to WT mice, judged by a significant reduction in the genes Glut4 (-29%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.01), Pfkm (-21%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05) and Hk2 (-39%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001). Moreover, Prg4 KO mice showed a favorable white adipose tissue phenotype with lower uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acids (-46%; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05) and lower gene expression of inflammatory markers Cd68, Mcp1 and Tnfa (-65%, -81% and -63%, respectively; p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.01) than WT mice.CONCLUSION: Prg4 KO mice are protected from high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance and fatty liver disease.</p>

<p>Mast cells (MC) are innate immune cells involved in many physiological and pathological processes. However, studies of MC function and biology are hampered by the difficulties to obtain human primary MC. To solve this problem, we established a new method to produce easily and rapidly high numbers of MC for in vitro studies using human adipose tissue, which is an abundant and easy access tissue. Stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, obtained from human abdominal dermolipectomy, was cultured as spheroids in serum free medium supplemented in stem cell factor. Using this method, we generated, within 3 wk, a highly pure population of connective tissue-type MC expressing MC typical peptidases (tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase-A3) with a yield increasing over time. Stem cell factor was required for this culture, but unlike MC derived from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, this culture did not depend on IL-3 and -6. MC obtained with this method degranulated following FceRI cross-linking or stimulation by C5a, compound 48/80, and substance P. Interestingly, activation by anti-IgE of both white adipose tissue-MC and MC obtained from peripheral blood-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> pluripotent progenitor cells induced the production of PGs as well as proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, Il-6, and GM-CSF). In conclusion, we developed a new time saving and reproducible method to produce highly pure and functional human MC in 3 wk from human adipose tissue.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Severe sepsis has a high mortality rate. There is increasing evidence that human mesenchymal stem cells possess immunomodulatory properties in sepsis, particularly those from adipose tissue. We hypothesised that micro-fragmented human fat, obtained with minimal alteration of the stromal vascular niche, attenuates the inflammatory response and improves outcome in a murine model of sepsis.METHODS: Micro-fragmented fat, lipoaspirate, or saline was administered intraperitoneally 2 h after caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in C57Bl/6RJ ketamine-xylazine anaesthetised mice. The primary endpoint was the inflammatory score. Secondary endpoints included survival, physiological, histological, and biological parameters.RESULTS: In CLP mice, micro-fragmented fat administration significantly decreased the median (range) inflammatory score compared with saline [17 (14-20) vs 9 (8-12), P=0.006]. Secondary endpoints were also significantly improved in micro-fragmented fat-treated compared with saline-treated CLP mice. Improvement in inflammatory score and in survival was suppressed when micro-fragmented fat was co-administered with liposomes loaded with clodronate (macrophage toxin) or NS-398 (cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitor), but not with SC-560 (cyclo-oxygenase 1 inhibitor).CONCLUSIONS: In a murine model of severe sepsis, micro-fragmented fat improved early inflammatory status and outcome, at least in part, by a cyclo-oxygenase-2-mediated mechanism. The potential therapeutic value of micro-fragmented fat in severe sepsis warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>Erratic eating behavior disrupts the daily feeding and fasting pattern and leads to metabolic dysfunction and chronic diseases including cancer. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that time-restricted feeding of a high-fat diet (HFD) to the dark phase does not enhance mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-PyMT mice. Female mice were assigned to 3 groups and fed the standard AIN93G diet or an HFD with or without dark phase restricted feeding (12 hours). The duration of restricted feeding was 8 weeks. The HFD group had 24% more body fat mass than the AIN93G group; the body fat mass of the restricted group remained similar to that of the AIN93G group. Energy intake of the restricted group was similar to that of the HFD and AIN93G groups. The median mammary tumor latency was 5.8, 7.0, and 6.4 weeks for the AIN93G, HFD, and restricted groups, respectively. Mammary tumor progression was 241% higher in the HFD group than that in the AIN93G group; there was no significant difference in tumor progression between the restricted and AIN93G groups. Plasma concentrations of leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, angiopoietin-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor were significantly higher in the HFD group than those in the control group; these measurements were similar between the restricted and control groups. In conclusion, feeding restricted to the dark phase mitigates the HFD-enhanced mammary tumorigenesis; this may be related to the lower body adiposity and associated inflammatory and angiogenic signals.</p>

<p>Under specific conditions, white adipose tissue (WAT) depots are readily converted to a brown-like state, which is associated with weight loss. However, whether diet-derived factors directly induce browning of white adipocytes has yet to be established. Thus, we investigated the effects of allicin, one of the major components of garlic, on brown-like adipocyte formation in inguinal WAT (iWAT), and prevention of obesity and related complications in animal models. Allicin significantly increased mRNA and/or protein expression of brown adipocyte markers including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1 and differentiated iWAT stromal vascular cells (SVC), suggesting that allicin induced brown-like adipocyte formation in vitro. Concomitantly, allicin markedly enhanced the protein expression of KLF-15 and its interaction with UCP-1 promoter region. Such changes were absent in cells lacking KLF-15, suggesting the critical role of KLF15 in allicin action. Allicin also induced brown-like adipogenesis in vivo along with the appearance of multilocular adipocytes, increased UCP1 expression and increased lipid oxidation. In summary, our data suggest that allicin potentially prevents obesity and associated metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus by enhancing the expression of brown adipocyte-specific genes, including UCP-1, through KLF15 signal cascade.</p>

<p>Hypertension is a multifactorial disease with limited knowledge of the involved mechanisms. p,p’-DDE ( p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) is a pollutant commonly found in tissues that interferes with endocrine signaling. This study aimed to evaluate the mechanism of hypertension triggered by p,p’-DDE exposure in the presence or absence of a HF (high-fat) diet in rats. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was evaluated by qPCR in liver and adipose tissue (AT), and a transcriptome analysis comparing visceral AT of HF diet and HF/DDE groups was performed. HF diet influenced RAS, but the p,p’-DDE effect was more evident in liver than in AT (interaction between the diet and p,p’-DDE treatment affected aldosterone receptor and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 expression in liver, p &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA). p,p’-DDE induced a decrease in the expression of genes involved in the retinoid acid biosynthesis pathway (Crabp1; -2.07-fold; p = 0.018), eNOS activation (Nos1; -1.64-fold; p = 0.012), and regulation and urea cycle (Ass1; -2.07-fold; p = 0.02). This study suggested that p,p’-DDE may play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, not exclusively in RAS but also by induction of hyperuricemia and increased oxidative stress, which may lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress and vascular injury.</p>

<p>The proangiogenic capacity of adipose tissue and its derivatives has been demonstrated in a variety of studies. The paracrine mechanism of the cellular component is considered to play a critical role in the regenerative properties of these tissues. However, cell-based therapy for clinical application has been hindered by limitations such as safety, immunogenicity issues, and difficulties in cell preservation, transportation, and phenotype control.

<p>GPIHBP1 is a protein localized at the endothelial cell surface that facilitates triglyceride (TG) lipolysis by binding lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Whether Glycosyl Phosphatidyl Inositol high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) function is impaired and may underlie the hyperTG phenotype observed in type 2 diabetes is not yet established. To elucidate the mechanism underlying impaired TG homeostasis in insulin resistance state we studied the effect of insulin on GPIHBP1 protein expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) under flow conditions. Next, we assessed visceral adipose tissue GPIHBP1 protein expression in type 2 diabetes Lepr db/db mouse model as well as in subjects with ranging levels of insulin resistance. We report that insulin reduces the expression of GPIHBP1 protein in HMVECs. Furthermore, GPIHBP1 protein expression in visceral adipose tissue in Lepr db/db mice is significantly reduced as is the active monomeric form of GPIHBP1 as compared to Leprdb/m mice. A similar decrease in GPIHBP1 protein was observed in subjects with increased body weight. GPIHBP1 protein expression was negatively associated with insulin and HOMA-IR. In conclusion, our data suggest that decreased GPIHBP1 availability in insulin resistant state may hamper peripheral lipolysis capacity.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate predictive values of sarcopenia and visceral obesity measured from preoperative CT/MRIs for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with periampullary malignancies.METHODS: From the prospectively constructed surgical registry, we included adult patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy. Based on CT/MRIs, body morphometric analysis was performed to evaluate the visceral obesity and sarcopenia, based on the areas of visceral fat and skeletal muscle measured at the L3 vertebrae level. We retrieved various perioperative factors from registry. As outcomes of postoperative complications, we evaluated POPF and major complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.RESULTS: From a total of 284 patients (163 males, 121 females) who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, POPF, major complications, and 60-day mortality occurred in 52 (18.3%), 34 (12.0%), and 6 (2.1%), respectively. Sarcopenia and visceral obesity were noted in 123 (75.5%) and 66 (40.5%) of men and 68 (56.2%) and 53 (43.8%) of women, respectively. Combination of sarcopenia and obesity (sarcopenic obesity) was noted in 31.9% (52/163) of men and in 26.4% (32/121) of women. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, sarcopenic obesity was the only independent predictor for POPF (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.43-4.93), and the vascular resection during pancreaticoduodenectomy was the only independent predictor for severe complications (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.61-8.70).CONCLUSION: Sarcopenic obesity might be highly predictive for POPF. Body morphometric analysis in preoperative CT/MRI combined with assessment of perioperative clinical features may help to identify high-risk patients and determine perioperative management strategies.KEY POINTS: • Sarcopenic obesity might be predictive for postoperative pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. • The vascular resection during pancreaticoduodenectomy might be predictive of major complications. • Body morphometric analysis might be helpful for identifying high-risk patients.</p>

<p>We have previously shown that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) accelerate wound healing in a diabetic mouse model. In this study, we hypothesized that adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSC), cells of greater translational potential to human therapy, improve diabetic wound healing to a similar extent as BMSC. In vitro, the characterization and function of murine ADSC and BMSC as well as human diabetic and nondiabetic ADSC were evaluated by flow cytometry, cell viability, and VEGF expression. In vivo, biomimetic collagen scaffolds containing murine ADSC or BMSC were used to treat splinted full-thickness excisional back wounds on diabetic C57BL/6 mice, and human healthy and diabetic ADSC were used to treat back wounds on nude mice. Wound healing was evaluated by wound area, local VEGF-A expression, and count of CD31-positive cells. Delivery of murine ADSC or BMSC accelerated wound healing in diabetic mice to a similar extent, compared with acellular controls ( P &lt; 0.0001). Histological analysis showed similarly increased cellular proliferation ( P &lt; 0.0001), VEGF-A expression ( P = 0.0002), endothelial cell density ( P &lt; 0.0001), numbers of macrophages ( P &lt; 0.0001), and smooth muscle cells ( P &lt; 0.0001) with ADSC and BMSC treatment, compared with controls. Cell survival and migration of ADSC and BMSC within the scaffolds were similar ( P = 0.781). Notch signaling was upregulated to a similar degree by both ADSC and BMSC. Diabetic and nondiabetic human ADSC expressed similar levels of VEGF-A ( P = 0.836) in vitro, as well as in scaffolds ( P = 1.000). Delivery of human diabetic and nondiabetic ADSC enhanced wound healing to a similar extent in a nude mouse wound model. Murine ADSC and BMSC delivered in a biomimetic-collagen scaffold are equivalent at enhancing diabetic wound healing. Human diabetic ADSC are not inferior to nondiabetic ADSC at accelerating wound healing in a nude mouse model. This data suggests that ADSC are a reasonable choice to evaluate for translational therapy in the treatment of human diabetic wounds.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) contain lineage-committed progenitor cells that have the ability to differentiate into various cell types that may be useful for autologous cell transplantation to correct defects of skin, adipose, cartilage, bone, tendon, and blood vessels. The multipotent characteristics of ADSCs, as well as their abundance in the human body, make them an attractive potential resource for wound repair and applications to tissue engineering. ADSC transplantation has been used in combination with biomaterials, including cell sheets, hydrogel, and three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds based on chitosan, fibrin, atelocollagen, and decellularized porcine dermis, etc. Furthermore, low molecular weight heparin/protamine nanoparticles (LH/P NPs) have been used as an inducer of ADSC aggregation. The tissue engineering potential of these biomaterials as cell carriers is increased by the synergistic relationship between ADSCs and the biomaterials, resulting in the release of angiogenic cytokines and growth factors. In this review article, we describe the advantages of ADSC transplantation for tissue engineering, focusing on biomaterials as cell carriers which we have studied.</p>

<p>Adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) exerts anti-inflammatory effects. However, the role of A2AR in obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation remains to be elucidated. The present study examined the expression of A2AR in adipose tissue of mice with diet-induced obesity and determined the effect of A2AR disruption on the status of obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation. WT C57BL/6J mice and A2AR-disrupted mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obesity and adipose tissue inflammation. In vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages from A2AR-disrupted mice and WT control mice were treated with palmitate and examined for macrophage proinflammatory activation. Compared with that of low-fat diet (LFD)-fed WT mice, A2AR expression in adipose tissue of HFD-fed WT mice was increased significantly and was present predominantly in adipose tissue macrophages. The increase in adipose tissue A2AR expression in HFD-fed mice was accompanied with increased phosphorylation states of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 p46 and nuclear factor kappa B p65 and mRNA levels of interleukin (Il)-1beta, Il6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In A2AR-disrupted mice, HFD feeding induced significant increases in adipose tissue inflammation, indicated by enhanced proinflammatory signaling and increased proinflammatory cytokine expression, and adipose tissue insulin resistance, indicated by a decrease in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation relative to those in WT mice. Lastly, A2AR disruption enhanced palmitate-induced macrophage proinflammatory activation. Taken together, these results suggest that A2AR plays a protective role in obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation, which is attributable to, in large part, A2AR suppression of macrophage proinflammatory activation.</p>

<p>A wealth of clinical and epidemiological evidence has linked obesity to a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, stroke, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Obesity can increase CVD morbidity and mortality directly and indirectly. Direct effects are mediated by obesity-induced structural and functional adaptations of the cardiovascular system to accommodate excess body weight, as well as by adipokine effects on inflammation and vascular homeostasis. Indirect effects are mediated by co-existing CVD risk factors such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Adipose tissue (AT) quality and functionality are more relevant aspects for cardiometabolic risk than its total amount. The consequences of maladaptive AT expansion in obesity are local and systemic: the local include inflammation, hypoxia, dysregulated adipokine secretion and impaired mitochondrial function; the systemic comprise insulin resistance, abnormal glucose/lipid metabolism, hypertension, a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state and endothelial dysfunction, all of which provide linking mechanisms for the association between obesity and CVD. The present narrative review summarizes the major pathophysiological links between obesity and CVD (traditional and novel concepts), analyses the heterogeneity of obesity-related cardiometabolic consequences, and provides an overview of the cardiovascular impact of weight loss interventions.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: The prognostic value of vascular calcifications as well as of regional fat depots has been reported separately, in population-based studies, and using gated-computed tomography (CT) examinations. We, therefore, explored the interplay and prognostic value of vascular calcifications and adipose tissue depots assessed during conventional nongated chest CT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled a consecutive series of 1250 patients aged between 35 and 74 years who underwent clinically indicated chest CT scans. We measured the extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) using the segment-involvement score (CACSIS), and aortic and valve calcification. Pericardial fat volume (PFV), hepatic fat, and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were also calculated. Patients were followed-up for all-cause mortality.RESULTS: A total of 577 (46%) patients had presence of CAC in the coronary tree. Over a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, 51 (4%) deaths occurred, 23 (4.1%) in male patients and 28 (4.1%) in female patients. Patients with higher PFV were older (P&lt;0.0001), more frequently male (P&lt;0.0001), had higher abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (P&lt;0.0001), hepatic fat (P&lt;0.0001), as well as a larger extent of CAC (P&lt;0.0001), aortic calcium (P&lt;0.0001), and valve calcium (P&lt;0.0001). From a multivariable Cox regression model, age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.11), P=0.001, PFV upper tertile (HR, 4.07; 95% CI, 2.09-7.92), P&lt;0.0001, and CACSIS&gt;5 (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.14-4.23; P&lt;0.0001) were independent predictors of all-cause death.CONCLUSIONS: In this relatively large patient cohort undergoing clinically indicated conventional chest CT scans, PFV and coronary calcification were high-risk markers associated with worsening survival.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis, also called calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a highly morbid syndrome characterized by calcium deposition and occlusion of small arterial vessels of the dermis and subdermal adipose tissue, leading to necrosis and gangrene. Penile involvement is rare and its management presents considerable challenges.CASE: We review the case of a 47-year-old man with end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus, and urinary incontinence who presented with a painful necrotic lesion on his glans penis, and the second and third toes of his right foot. Following diagnosis of calciphylaxis of the toes and penis, he was conservatively managed with topical wound care, sodium thiosulfate adjustment of hemodialysis, and phosphate binder medications. Over the course of 2 months, his wound worsened in the setting of continued urinary incontinence, and before planned diversion with a suprapubic catheter, he progressed to gangrene and sepsis. After a goals-of-care discussion with the patient and family, he elected to forego debridement and was discharged on home-based palliative care.CONCLUSIONS: Penile calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening disease that portends a poor prognosis. Conservative principles for management include normalization of calcium phosphate levels and local wound care. Penectomy may not impact survival. Ultimately, each case is individualized, and we encourage establishing goals of care in collaborative discussion with an interdisciplinary care team, patient, and family.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: To obtain a saphenous vein graft (SVG) for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the benefit of using a no-touch (NT) technique in vascular function has not been fully investigated. Methods and Results: The pathological and physiological functions of human SVGs with a NT technique to preserve the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and ones obtained by using a conventional (CON) technique removing PVAT, were examined. Immunohistochemistry of the section of SVGs showed that the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the endothelium of the NT group was more responsive to vascular endothelial growth factor. A myograph of SVGs showed greater contraction with phenylephrine in the NT group. However, the strong contraction was eliminated in SVGs taken by electrocautery. In the 10 patients whose SVGs were taken without electrocautery, endothelial-dependent relaxation with bradykinin was apparently increased in the CON group more than in the NT group. Smooth muscle relaxation with nitroprusside was higher in the CON group at the lower concentrations; however, the relaxation became greater in the NT group at the high concentrations. Therefore, the effect of neutralizing PVAT-released factors in the both groups was further examined. After medium of NT and CON were exchanged in half, relaxation of SVGs was immediately restored in the NT group.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the NT technique preserves the functions of vasoconstriction and relaxation. Also, the presence of PVAT-released vasoconstrictive factors was suspected.</p>

<p>AIMS: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vasculature. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exert immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects by secreting humoral factors; however, the intravascular MSC administration presents a risk of vascular occlusion. Here, we investigated both the effect of conditioned medium from cultured MSCs (MSC-CM) on atherosclerosis and the underlying mechanism.METHODS AND RESULTS: Low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet and received intravenous injections of either MSC-CM from adipose tissue-derived MSCs or control medium 2×/week for 13<U+2009>weeks. MSC-CM treatment decreased the atherosclerotic plaque area in the aorta and aortic root of Ldlr-/- mice by 41% and 30%, respectively, with no change in serum lipoprotein levels. Histopathologically, the MSC-CM treatment decreased the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and the accumulation of macrophages on the vascular walls. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and supernatant (MSC-CM supernatant) were separated from the MSC-CM by ultracentrifugation. In tumour necrosis factor-a stimulated human aortic endothelial cells (HAOECs), both the MSC EVs and MSC-CM supernatant decreased CAM expression by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF<U+03BA>B) pathways. In macrophages, the MSC-CM supernatant decreased the lipopolysaccharide-induced increases in M1 marker expression by inhibiting both the MAPK and NF<U+03BA>B pathways and increased the expression of M2 markers by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway. In co-culture, inflamed HAOECs pretreated with MSC-CM supernatant and MSC EVs exhibited decreased monocyte adhesion to HAOECs. In addition, the neutralization of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in MSC-CM or MSC-CM supernatant attenuated their abilities to suppress monocyte adhesion to HAOECs in co-culture.CONCLUSION: MSC-CM ameliorated atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice and suppressed CAM expression and macrophage accumulation in the vascular walls. Humoral factors, including HGF and EVs from MSCs, hold promise as therapeutic agents to reduce the residual risk of coronary artery diseases.</p>

<p>Bariatric surgery and other therapeutic options for obese patients are often evaluated by the loss of weight, reduction of comorbidities or improved quality of life. However, little is currently known about potential therapy-related changes in the adipose tissue of obese patients. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify fat fraction (FF) and T1 relaxation time by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and compare the resulting values with the preoperative ones. Corresponding MRI data were available from 23 patients (16 females and 7 males) that had undergone MRI before (M0) and one month after (M1) bariatric surgery. Patients were 22-59 years old (mean age 44.3 years) and their BMI ranged from 35.7-54.6 kg/m2 (mean BMI 44.6 kg/m2) at M0. Total visceral AT volumes (VVAT-T, in L) were measured by semi-automatic segmentation of axial MRI images acquired between diaphragm and femoral heads. MRI FF and T1 relaxation times were measured in well-defined regions of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue using two custom-made analysis tools. Average BMI values were 45.4 kg/m2 at time point M0 and 42.4 kg/m2 at M1. Corresponding VVAT-T values were 5.94 L and 5.33 L. Intraindividual differences in both BMI and VVAT-T were highly significant (p&lt;0.001). Average relaxation times T1VAT were 303.7 ms at M0 and 316.9 ms at M1 (p&lt;0.001). Corresponding T1SAT times were 283.2 ms and 280.7 ms (p = 0.137). Similarly, FFVAT differences (M0: 85.7%, M1: 83.4%) were significant (p &lt;0.01) whereas FFSAT differences (M0: 86.1, M1: 85.9%) were not significant (p = 0.517). In conclusion, bariatric surgery is apparently not only related to a significant reduction in common parameters of adipose tissue distribution, here BMI and total visceral fat volume, but also significant changes in T1 relaxation time and fat fraction of visceral adipose tissue. Such quantitative MRI measures may potentially serve as independent biomarkers for longitudinal and cross-sectional measurements in obese patients.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: Diabetes is associated with a deterioration of the microvasculature in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and with a decrease in its metabolic activity. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography has been recently proposed as a new tool capable of differentiating healthy and diabetic BAT by observing hemoglobin gradients and microvasculature density in cross-sectional (2D) views. We report on the use of spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography (SVOT) for an improved characterization of BAT.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SVOT may serve as an effective tool for studying the effects of diabetes on BAT. The volumetric optoacoustic imaging probe used for the SVOT scans can be operated in a handheld mode, thus potentially providing a clinical translation route for BAT-related studies with this imaging technology.</p>

<p>Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of fat accumulation and its metabolic consequences is crucial to understanding and treating obesity, an epidemic disease. We have previously observed that Usp19 deubiquitinating enzyme-null mice (Usp19<sup>-/-</sup>) have significantly lower fat mass than wild-type (WT) mice.

Thus, this study aimed to provide further understanding of the role of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 19 (USP19) in fat development, obesity and diabetes.In this study, the metabolic phenotypes of WT and Usp19<sup>-/-</sup> mice were compared. The stromal vascular fractions (SVFs) of inguinal fat pads from WT and Usp19<sup>-/-</sup> mice were isolated and cells were differentiated into adipocytes in culture to assess their adipogenic capacity. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 18 weeks. Body composition, glucose metabolism and metabolic variables were assessed. In addition, following insulin injection, signalling activity was analysed in the muscle, liver and adipose tissue. Finally, the correlation between the expression of Usp19 mRNA and adipocyte function genes in human adipose tissue was analysed.</AbstractText>: mice were isolated and cells were differentiated into adipocytes in culture to assess their adipogenic capacity.

Usp19<sup>-/-</sup> mice were also found to have smaller fat pads throughout the lifespan and a higher percentage of lean mass, compared with WT mice. When fed an HFD, Usp19<sup>-/-</sup> mice were more glucose tolerant, pyruvate tolerant and insulin sensitive than WT mice. Moreover, HFD-fed Usp19<sup>-/-</sup> mice had enhanced insulin signalling in the muscle and the liver, but not in adipose tissue. Finally, USP19 mRNA expression in human adipose tissue was positively correlated with the expression of important adipocyte genes in abdominal fat depots, but not subcutaneous fat depots.</AbstractText>: mice had enhanced insulin signalling in the muscle and the liver, but not in adipose tissue. Finally, USP19 mRNA expression in human adipose tissue was positively correlated with the expression of important adipocyte genes in abdominal fat depots, but not subcutaneous fat depots.USP19 is an important regulator of fat development. Its inactivation in mice exerts effects on multiple tissues, which may protect against the negative metabolic effects of high-fat feeding. These findings suggest that inhibition of USP19 could have therapeutic potential to protect from the deleterious consequences of obesity and diabetes.</AbstractText>: USP19 is an important regulator of fat development.

<p>Individuals of South Asian origin are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities compared with Europids. Disturbances in energy metabolism may contribute to this increased risk. Skeletal muscle and possibly also brown adipose tissue (BAT) are involved in human energy metabolism and nitric oxide (NO) is suggested to play a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in both tissues. We aimed to investigate the effects of 6 weeks of supplementation with L-arginine, a precursor of NO, on energy metabolism by BAT and skeletal muscle, as well as glucose metabolism in South Asian men compared with men of European descent.</AbstractText>: Individuals of South Asian origin are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities compared with Europids.

<p>The skin is the largest organ of the human body and is the first line of defense against physical and biological damage. Thus, the skin is equipped to self-repair and regenerates after trauma. Skin regeneration after damage comprises a tightly spatial-temporally regulated process of wound healing that involves virtually all cell types in the skin. Wound healing features five partially overlapping stages: homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, re-epithelization, and finally resolution or fibrosis. Dysreguled wound healing may resolve in dermal scarring. Adipose tissue is long known for its suppressive influence on dermal scarring. Cultured adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) secrete a plethora of regenerative growth factors and immune mediators that influence processes during wound healing e.g., angiogenesis, modulation of inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling. In clinical practice, ASCs are usually administered as part of fractionated adipose tissue i.e., as part of enzymatically isolated SVF (cellular SVF), mechanically isolated SVF (tissue SVF), or as lipograft. Enzymatic isolation of SVF obtained adipose tissue results in suspension of adipocyte-free cells (cSVF) that lack intact intercellular adhesions or connections to extracellular matrix (ECM). Mechanical isolation of SVF from adipose tissue destructs the parenchyma (adipocytes), which results in a tissue SVF (tSVF) with intact connections between cells, as well as matrix. To date, due to a lack of well-designed prospective randomized clinical trials, neither cSVF, tSVF, whole adipose tissue, or cultured ASCs can be indicated as the preferred preparation procedure prior to therapeutic administration. In this review, we present and discuss current literature regarding the different administration options to apply ASCs (i.e., cultured ASCs, cSVF, tSVF, and lipografting) to augment dermal wound healing, as well as the available indications for clinical efficacy.</p>

<p>Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a serious complication after trauma, surgery and fat emulsion input and can lead to serious pulmonary injury. Autophagy controls the cell survival and homeostasis by removing the mis-folded proteins and damaged organelles as well as intracellular pathogens through a lysosomal degradation pathway. Increasing research documented that autophagy was wildly involved in variety of human diseases and had huge therapeutic potential. However, the role and mechanism of autophagy in FES remains largely unknown. The rat model of FES was established by tail vein injection with fat and was assessed by Wet-to-Dry (W/D) ratio analysis, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) analysis, staining Oil red staining analysis and qPCR analysis. Western blots were employed to detect the expression of autophagy markers. The changes of pulmonary injury were observed after premedication of rapamycin (an autophagy activator). The alveolar structural damage, red free fat substances in the blood vessels of lung, increased the lung ratio, and the up-regulated MPO expression and activity were showed in the FES models. The expressions of autophagy markers were decreased and meanwhile, apoptosis markers were increased in the FES model. Rapamycin restored the expression of autophagy markers and inhibited the apoptosis and further, resulting in the improvement of the pulmonary injury. Thus, our study demonstrated that autophagy was inhibited and apoptosis was promoted in FES and further Rapamycin alleviated the pulmonary damage in FES via restoring the autophagy and inhibiting the apoptosis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) may play a pivotal role by differentiating into multilineage cells or by secreting growth factors or cytokines in cell-assisted lipotransfer, which participates in adipose tissue regeneration. The angiogenic potential of various ADSCs from different anatomical regions remains uncertain.OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to offer appropriate choices of sources of adipose-derived stromal cells for cell-assisted lipotransfer and tissue engineering.METHODS: ADSCs were harvested from subcutaneous adipose depots in the abdomen and thighs. The expression of adipocyte-specific markers was evaluated, and Oil Red O staining was performed to assess the capacity for adipogenic differentiation. Angiogenic differentiation potential was evaluated by detecting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor 2, and CD31. A tube formation assay was also performed to analyze the angiogenic differentiation capacity.RESULTS: ADSCs from the thigh showed more significant angiogenic and adipogenic potential. More lipogenesis was identified in ADSCs from the thigh, and this was accompanied by the enhancement of adipocyte markers. Angiogenesis was more vigorous in the thigh-derived stromal cells, and ADSCs from the thigh depot showed more junctions and longer tubule formation on Matrigel in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: Thigh-derived ADSCs exhibited greater capacity for adipogenic and angiogenic differentiation and would be a better option for cell-assisted lipotransfer and tissue engineering.</p>

<p>Organ manufacturing is an attractive high-tech research field which can solve the serious donor shortage problems for allograft organ transplantation, high throughput drug screening, and energy metabolism model establishment. How to integrate heterogeneous cell types along with other biomaterials to form bioartificial organs is one of the kernel issues for organ manufacturing. At present, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of adipose-derives stem cell (ADSC) containing hydrogels has shown the most bright futures with respect to overcoming all the difficult problems encountered by tissue engineers over the last several decades. In this chapter, we briefly introduce the 3D ADSC bioprinting technologies for organ manufacturing, especially for the branched vascular network construction.</p>

<p>AIMS: Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has therapeutic effects for schizophrenia. However, clinical reports indicate that patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs are at high risk of metabolic syndrome with unclear mechanisms. We investigated the effect of olanzapine on atherosclerosis and the mechanisms in apolipoprotein E-null (apoE-/-) mice.METHODS: ApoE-/- mice were used as in vivo models. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein expression. Conventional assay kits were applied to assess the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, fatty acids, glycerol, and cytokines.RESULTS: Daily treatment with olanzapine (3 mg/kg body weight) for four weeks increased mean arterial blood pressure and the whitening of brown adipose tissue in mice. In addition, olanzapine impaired aortic cholesterol homeostasis and exacerbated hyperlipidemia and aortic inflammation, which accelerated atherosclerosis in mice. Moreover, lipid accumulation in liver, particularly total cholesterol, free cholesterol, fatty acids, and glycerol, was increased with olanzapine treatment in apoE-/- mice by upregulating the expression of de novo lipid synthesis-related proteins and downregulating that of cholesterol clearance- or very low-density lipoprotein secretion-related proteins.CONCLUSION: Olanzapine may exacerbate atherosclerosis by deregulating hepatic lipid metabolism and worsening hyperlipidemia and aortic inflammation.</p>

<p>Adipocytes arise from the commitment and differentiation of adipose precursors in white adipose tissue (WAT). In studying adipogenesis, precursor markers, including Pref-1 and PDGFRa, are used to isolate precursors from stromal vascular fractions of WAT, but the relation among the markers is not known. Here, we used the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system in mice for labeling Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells and for inducible inactivation of the Pref-1 target Sox9. We show the requirement of Sox9 for the maintenance of Pref-1<sup>+</sup> proliferative, early precursors. Upon Sox9 inactivation, these Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells become PDGFRa<sup>+</sup> cells that express early adipogenic markers. Thus, we show that Pref-1<sup>+</sup> cells precede PDGFRa<sup>+</sup> cells in the adipogenic pathway and that Sox9 inactivation is required for WAT growth and expansion. Furthermore, we show that in maintaining early adipose precursors, Sox9 activates Meis1, which prevents adipogenic differentiation. Our study also demonstrates the Pref-1 promoter-rtTA system for inducible gene inactivation in early adipose precursor populations.</p>

<p>The vascular wall within adipose tissue is a source of mesenchymal progenitors, referred to as perivascular stem/stromal cells (PSC). PSC are isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and defined as a bipartite population of pericytes and adventitial progenitor cells (APCs). Those factors that promote the differentiation of PSC into bone or fat cell types are not well understood. Here, we observed high expression of WISP-1 among human PSC in vivo, after purification, and upon transplantation in a bone defect. Next, modulation of WISP-1 expression was performed, using WISP-1 overexpression, WISP-1 protein, or WISP-1 siRNA. Results demonstrated that WISP-1 is expressed in the perivascular niche, and high expression is maintained after purification of PSC, and upon transplantation in a bone microenvironment. In vitro studies demonstrate that WISP-1 has pro-osteogenic/anti-adipocytic effects in human PSC, and that regulation of BMP signaling activity may underlie these effects. In summary, our results demonstrate the importance of the matricellular protein WISP-1 in regulation of the differentiation of human stem cell types within the perivascular niche. WISP-1 signaling upregulation may be of future benefit in cell therapy mediated bone tissue engineering, for the healing of bone defects or other orthopaedic applications.</p>

<p>Corin has been studied extensively within the vascular system and is known to regulate blood pressure. We have shown that corin is one of the most highly upregulated genes during osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). This study tested the hypothesis that, through modulation of angiogenic signalling pathways, corin is a critical regulator of osteogenic differentiation and endochondral ossification. In vitro, corin expression in hASC was suppressed via siRNA knockdown and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression was quantified via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In vivo, a murine corin knockout model (female, 10 weeks) was used to determine the effect of corin deficiency on long bone development. Wild-type and corin knockout long bones were compared via haematoxylin and eosin staining to assess tissue characteristics and cellular organization, three-point bending to assess mechanical characteristics, and immunohistochemistry to visualize VEGF-A expression patterns. Corin knockdown significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased VEGF-A mRNA expression during osteogenic differentiation. In vivo, corin knockout reduced tibial growth plate thickness (p &lt; 0.01) and severely diminished the hypertrophic region. Corin knockout femurs had significantly increased stiffness (p &lt; 0.01) and maximum loads (p &lt; 0.01) but reduced postyield deflections (p &lt; 0.01). In corin knockout mice, VEGF-A expression was increased near the growth plate but was reduced throughout the tibial shaft and distal head of the tibiae. This is the first study to show that corin is a key regulator of bone development by modulation of VEGF-A expression. Further elucidation of this mechanism will aid in the development of optimized bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies.</p>

<p>One of the new targets of untapped therapeutic potential is perivascular adipose tissue (pVAT). pVAT releases a plethora of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents and is involved in the inflammatory response of the vascular wall, playing a key role in various cardiovascular pathologies. Both fiber optic Raman spectroscopy with a high-spatial resolution probe and Raman microscopy were applied to study various types of adipose tissue with the emphasis on pVATs of the thoracic and abdominal aorta and the mesenteric artery, as well as epididymal and interscapular adipose tissue for comparison. Our results demonstrated that the lipid unsaturation degree was clearly distinct in various types of adipose tissue and was influenced by the age of animals. In particular, the basal unsaturation level of pVATs of the abdominal aorta and the mesenteric artery was considerably higher than that of the thoracic aorta and a significant increase of the unsaturation level of pVAT with age was observed showing that aging has a considerable impact on the pVAT’s chemical composition. Overall, our results show that Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive tool to determine the perivascular adipose tissue chemical composition that appears to be vascular-bed specific.</p>

<p>Arm lymphedema is a well-recognized complication after breast cancer surgery that negatively impacts patients’ quality of life, both physiologically and psychologically. Lymph stasis and inflammation result in excess formation of adipose tissue, which makes removal of the deposited subcutaneous fat necessary to eliminate the excess volume.

<p>Increasing recognition of an association between obesity and many cancer types exists, but how the myriad of local and systemic effects of obesity affect key cellular and non-cellular processes within the tumour microenvironment (TME) relevant to carcinogenesis, tumour progression and response to therapies remains poorly understood. The TME is a complex cellular environment in which the tumour exists along with blood vessels, immune cells, fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, signalling molecules and the extracellular matrix. Obesity, in particular visceral obesity, might fuel the dysregulation of key pathways relevant to both the adipose microenvironment and the TME, which interact to promote carcinogenesis in at-risk epithelium. The tumour-promoting effects of obesity can occur at the local level as well as systemically via circulating inflammatory, growth factor and metabolic mediators associated with adipose tissue inflammation, as well as paracrine and autocrine effects. This Review explores key pathways linking visceral obesity and gastrointestinal cancer, including inflammation, hypoxia, altered stromal and immune cell function, energy metabolism and angiogenesis.</p>

<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from steatosis only to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The latter is characterized by hepatic inflammation, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is poorly understood which factors contribute to the onset of hepatic inflammation characterizing the progression from steatosis to NASH. Previously, we demonstrated increased advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in the livers of NASH patients. We hypothesise that AGEs play a key role in NASH development by activating their proinflammatory receptor, RAGE. RAGE-deficient mice and wildtype littermates, both on Ldlr<sup>-/-</sup> background, were fed a Western type diet (WTD) for 3 or 12 weeks. Flow cytometry, histology, gene expression and AGE measurements were performed to evaluate the effects of RAGE deficiency. RAGE-deficient mice displayed reduced weight gain and visceral fat expansion compared to control mice. No difference in adipose tissue inflammation was observed between groups. RAGE deficiency did not affect WTD-induced monocytosis, circulating lipids or hepatic steatosis. WTD-induced hepatic neutrophil and macrophage accumulation and atherosclerotic plaque development was comparable between control and RAGE-deficient mice. No difference in AGE levels was observed. RAGE does not seem to play a major role in the development of NASH or atherosclerosis in a hyperlipidemic mouse model.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common debilitating disorders. Recently, numerous attempts have been made to improve the functions of the knees by using different forms of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In Korea, bone marrow concentrates and cord blood-derived stem cells have been approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) for cartilage regeneration. In addition, an adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has been allowed by the KFDA for joint injections in human patients. Autologous adipose tissue-derived SVF contains extracellular matrix (ECM) in addition to mesenchymal stem cells. ECM excretes various cytokines that, along with hyaluronic acid (HA) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) activated by calcium chloride, may help MSCs to regenerate cartilage and improve knee functions. In this article, we presented a protocol to improve knee functions by regenerating cartilage-like tissue in human patients with OA. The result of the protocol was first reported in 2011 followed by a few additional publications. The protocol involves liposuction to obtain autologous lipoaspirates that are mixed with collagenase. This lipoaspirates-collagenase mixture is then cut and homogenized to remove large fibrous tissue that may clog up the needle during the injection. Afterwards, the mixture is incubated to obtain adipose tissue-derived SVF. The resulting adipose tissue-derived SVF, containing both adipose tissue-derived MSCs and remnants of ECM, is injected into knees of patients, combined with HA and calcium chloride activated PRP. Included are three cases of patients who were treated with our protocol resulting in improvement of knee pain, swelling, and range of motion along with MRI evidence of hyaline cartilage-like tissue.</p>

Patients’ articular functionality and pain were evaluated by VAS and WOMAC scores at three, six and 18 months from infusion. The osteogenic and chondrogenic ability of ASCs contained in the injected adipose tissue was studied in in vitro primary osteoblast and chondrocyte cell cultures, also plated on 3D-bone scaffold.

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), the adipose tissue that surrounds most of the vasculature, has emerged as an active component of the blood vessel wall regulating vascular homeostasis and affecting the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Although PVAT characteristics resemble both brown and white adipose tissues, recent evidence suggests that PVAT develops from its own distinct precursors implying a closer link between PVAT and vascular system. Under physiological conditions, PVAT has potent anti-atherogenic properties mediated by its ability to secrete various biologically active factors that induce non-shivering thermogenesis and metabolize fatty acids. In contrast, under pathological conditions (mainly obesity), PVAT becomes dysfunctional, loses its thermogenic capacity and secretes pro-inflammatory adipokines that induce endothelial dysfunction and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promoting atherosclerosis development. Since PVAT plays crucial roles in regulating key steps of atherosclerosis development, it may constitute a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. Here, we review the current literature regarding the roles of PVAT in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality, suggesting that treatment of NASH might benefit from combined approaches that target the liver and the cardiovascular components of NASH. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein-coupled bile acid-activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses liver and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile acids that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6ß-ethyl-3a,7ß-dihydroxy-5ß-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses liver and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed liver injury and promoted the browning of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6,TNF-a, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay. BAR501 reversed this pattern in a Gpbar1-dependent manner, highlighting a potential role for GPBAR1 agonism in treating the liver and vascular component of NASH.-Carino, A., Marchianò, S., Biagioli, M., Bucci, M., Vellecco, V., Brancaleone, V., Fiorucci, C., Zampella, A., Monti, M.

<p>This report documents an uncommon case of choristomatous cervical polyp-containing fat tissue. The patient was a 24-year-old female who presented with irregular intermenstrual bleeding. On examination, a polypoid lesion with smooth outlines, measuring 1 cm in diameter was removed. Microscopic examination demonstrated abnormal fibrous stroma, devoid of endocervical glands, containing mature adipose tissue, and thick-walled blood vessels. The lesion was covered by a typical mature squamous cell outer lining. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report of an adipose tissue arising from the cervical wall. Further clinicopathologic considerations are needed to elucidate the origin of the fatty component in cervical polyps.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity can lead to adipose tissue inflammation, which causes insulin resistance and on the long-term type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The inflammatory changes of obese-adipose tissue are characterized by macrophage infiltration and activation, but validated circulating biomarkers for adipose tissue inflammation for clinical use are still lacking. One of the most secreted enzymes by activated macrophages is chitotriosidase (CHIT1).OBJECTIVE: To test whether circulating CHIT1 enzymatic activity levels reflect adipose tissue inflammation.METHODS: Plasma and adipose tissue samples of 105 subjects (35 lean, 37 overweight, and 33 T2D patients) were investigated. CHIT1 mRNA levels were determined in adipose tissue-resident innate immune cells. CHIT1 mRNA levels, protein abundance, and plasma enzymatic activity were subsequently measured in adipose tissue biopsies and plasma of control subjects with varying levels of obesity and adipose tissue inflammation as well as in T2D patients.RESULTS: In adipose tissue, CHIT1 mRNA levels were higher in stromal vascular cells compared to adipocytes, and higher in adipose tissue-residing macrophages compared to circulating monocytes (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). CHIT1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue were enhanced in overweightcompared to lean subjects and even more in T2D patients (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). In contrast, plasma CHIT1 enzymatic activity did not differ between lean, overweight subjects and T2D patients. A mutation of the CHIT1 gene decreases plasma CHIT1 activity.CONCLUSIONS: CHIT1 is expressed by adipose tissue macrophages and expression is higher in overweight subjects and T2D patients, indicating its potential as tissue biomarker for adipose tissue inflammation. However, these differences do not translate into different plasma CHIT1 activity levels. Moreover, a common CHIT1 gene mutation causing loss of plasma CHIT1 activity interferes with its use as a biomarker of adipose tissue inflammation. These results indicate that plasma CHIT1 activity is of limited value as a circulating biomarker for adipose tissue inflammation in human subjects.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Chronic low-grade inflammation/meta-inflammation in adipose tissue leads to obesity-associated metabolic complications. Despite growing understanding, the roles of immune cell subsets, their interrelationship, and chronological events leading to progression of obesity-associated insulin resistance (IR) remains unclear.METHODS: We carried out temporal immunometabolic profiling of adipose tissue from C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks. We used clodronate sodium liposomes (CLODs) to deplete macrophages and disodium cromoglycate sodium liposomes (DSCGs) to stabilize mast cells.RESULTS: In the temporal HFD settings, mice showed progressive glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue senescence. Histochemistry analysis of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) using picro-sirius red and Masson’s trichrome staining showed extensive collagen deposition in the 16th and 20th weeks. Flow cytometry analysis of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from eWAT revealed T-cell subsets as early-phase components and pro-inflammatory macrophages, as well as mast cells as the later phase components during obesity progression. In our therapeutic strategies, macrophage depletion by CLOD and mast stabilization by DSCG attenuated obesity, adipose tissue fibrosis, and improved whole-body glucose homeostasis. In addition, mast cell stabilization also attenuated senescence (p53 and X-gal staining) in eWAT, signifying the role of mast cells over macrophages during obesity.CONCLUSION: New-generation mast cell stabilizers can be exploited for the treatment of obesity-associated metabolic complications.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Obesity and its associated morbidities represent the major and most rapidly expanding world-wide health epidemic. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reveal that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant in the Family with Sequence Similarity 13, Member A (FAM13A) gene is strongly associated with waist-hip ratio (WHR) with adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (WHRadjBMI). However, the function of FAM13A in adipose development and obesity remains largely uncharacterized.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FAM13A is dispensable for adipose development and insulin sensitivity. Yet the expression of FAM13A needs to be tightly controlled in adipose precursor cells for their proper survival and downstream adipogenesis. These data provide novel insights into the link between FAM13A and obesity.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Since the discovery of active brown adipose tissue in human adults, non-shivering cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) has been regarded as a promising tool to combat obesity. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the method of choice to analyze indirect calorimetry data from a CIT study. We analyzed the impact of methods for data selection and methods for data analysis on measures of cold-induced energy expenditure (EE) and nutrient oxidation rates.RESULTS: Mean overall CIT estimation ranged from 11.6 ± 10.0 to 20.1 ± 17.2 %RMR depending on the methods for data selection and analysis used. Regarding methods for data selection, 5min-SS-2P did not allow to observe physiologically relevant phenomena (e.g. metabolic shift in fuel oxidation; P = 0.547) due to a lack of resolution. The 5min-TI and 5min-SS-4P methods for data selection seemed to be accurate enough to observe physiologically relevant phenomena (all P &lt; 0.014), but not comparable for estimating over-all CIT and cold-induced nutrient oxidation rates (P &lt; 0.01). Regarding methods for data analysis, the AUC seemed to be less affected for data artefacts and to be more representative in participants with a non-stable energy expenditure during cold exposure.CONCLUSIONS: The methods for data selection and analysis can have a profound impact on CIT and cold-induced nutrient oxidation rates estimations, and therefore, it is mandatory to unify it across scientific community to allow inter-study comparisons. Based on our findings, 5min-TI should be considered the method of choice to study dynamics (i.e. changes across time) of CIT and cold-induced nutrient oxidation rates, while 5min-SS-4P and AUC should be the method of choice when computing CIT and cold-induced nutrient oxidation rates as a single value.</p>

<p>The aim of the study was to identify and functionally characterize novel candidate gene/s involved in the development of resistance to diet-induced obesity in rats. In a high-fat-diet (HFD) study of rats, we found subgroups which either developed resistance to HFD-induced obesity (DR) or showed an obesity-prone phenotype (DIO). Gene expression analysis in 10 samples (5 DIO vs 5 DR) was performed. The most promising gene, OR6C3 (orthologous with rat Olr984 and mouse Olfr788) was measured by qRT-PCR in paired samples of human visceral (Vis) and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue (AT) (n<U+202F>=<U+202F>225) and in sub-fractions of adipocytes and cells of stromal vascular fraction. Gene expression analyses showed Olr984 with significantly reduced mRNA expression in DR rats. In the Vis AT of human samples we found an up-regulation of OR6C3 compared to SC AT, independent of gender, glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. We observed significantly lower levels of SC AT OR6C3 mRNA in subjects with obesity compared to those with normal-weight or overweight. OR6C3 is more expressed in SVF than in adipocytes. Olr984 could be a novel candidate gene related to diet-induced obesity in rats. Variation in human AT mRNA expression is related to obesity parameters and glucose homeostasis and linked to the regulatory role of insulin on the Olr984.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The addition of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) can enhance the postoperative survival rate of fat. However, a universal SVF application method is currently unavailable. Therefore, a simple and convenient guideline for SVF addition is needed for its clinical application.OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to evaluate whether SVF can improve fat survival after large-volume fat grafting and to find a simple and convenient standard for the clinical use of SVF.METHODS: Patient fat samples were obtained after liposuction for SVF preparation and grafting. Four types of grafts were prepared with different SVF ratios: 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 SVF:fat. After intensive mixing, fat grafts (5 mL) were randomly injected into both sides of the backs of athymic rats (n = 15). At 24 hours and 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after the operation, microcomputed tomography scanning was performed to calculate the fat survival rate.RESULTS: Nine months after the operation, the survival rates of fat in the 4 groups were 8.89 ± 1.62% (0:1), 18.26 ± 3.85% (1:1), 8.83 ± 1.46% (2:1), and 7.96 ± 1.31% (4:1). The 1:1 group exhibited the greatest survival rate (P &lt; 0.01), and the adipose tissue histological patterns and blood vessel quality were enhanced compared with those in the other groups.CONCLUSIONS: An appropriate SVF ratio can increase the fat survival rate after large-volume fat grafting, but no linear relationship exists between the SVF ratio and fat survival. The optimal SVF:fat ratio for grafting is 1:1.</p>

<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential for diagnosis of fatty liver by means of ultrasonographic measurement of liver and perivisceral adipose tissue as an alternative to blood indicators of lipomobilization and liver biopsy in periparturient high-yielding dairy cows. Thirty cows were enrolled and divided into two groups. The evaluation of body condition score (BCS), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), liver and perivisceral adipose tissue ultrasonographic measurement and histological liver lipid content (GdL) was performed at 15 ± 5 d prepartum (T0), 10 ± 2 d postpartum (T1), 30 ± 2 d postpartum (T2) and 50 ± 2 d postpartum (T3). Mesenteric fat thickness (the thickness of the perivascular adipose tissue) measured on ultrasound was shown to be an independent determinant of fatty liver. The cut-off of the ultrasonographic evaluation of the liver may be useful as a first and practical approach in identifying fatty liver. In conclusion, a non-invasive and reliable diagnostic method for predicting the risk of fatty liver in high yielding dairy cows has been demonstrated.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: Initial studies have shown that optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an effective margin-evaluation tool for breast-conserving surgery, but methods for the interpretation of breast OCT images have not been directly studied. In this work, breast pathologies were assessed with a handheld OCT probe. OCT images and corresponding histology were used to develop guidelines for the identification of breast tissue features in OCT images.METHODS: Mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery specimens from 26 women were imaged with a handheld OCT probe. During standard pathology specimen dissection, representative 1-cm × 1-cm tissue regions were grossly identified, assessed with OCT, inked for orientation and image-matching purposes, and processed. Histology slides corresponding to the OCT image region were digitally photographed. OCT and histology images from the same region were paired by selecting the best structural matches.RESULTS: In total, 2880 OCT images were acquired from 26 breast specimens (from 26 patients) and 48 matching OCT-histology image pairs were identified. These matched image pairs illustrate tissue types including adipose tissue, dense fibrosis, fibroadipose tissue, blood vessels, regular and hyperplastic ducts and lobules, cysts, cyst, fibroadenoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, calcifications, and biopsy cavities. Differentiation between pathologies was achieved by considering feature boundaries, interior appearance, posterior shadowing or enhancement, and overall morphologic patterns.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first work to systematically catalog the critical features of breast OCT images. The results indicate that OCT can be used to identify and distinguish between benign and malignant features in human breast tissue.</p>

<p>We have uncovered the existence of extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated signaling between cell types within the adipose tissue (AT) proper. This phenomenon became evident in our attempts at generating an adipocyte-specific knockout of caveolin 1 (cav1) protein. Although we effectively ablated the CAV1 gene in adipocytes, cav1 protein remained abundant. With the use of newly generated mouse models, we show that neighboring endothelial cells (ECs) transfer cav1-containing EVs to adipocytes in vivo, which reciprocate by releasing EVs to ECs. AT-derived EVs contain proteins and lipids capable of modulating cellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, this mechanism facilitates transfer of plasma constituents from ECs to the adipocyte. The transfer event is physiologically regulated by fasting/refeeding and obesity, suggesting EVs participate in the tissue response to changes in the systemic nutrient state. This work offers new insights into the complex signaling mechanisms that exist among adipocytes, stromal vascular cells, and, potentially, distal organs.</p>

<p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, insulin resistance, obesity and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Currently there are no effective treatments to reverse the course of FGR. This study used the eNOS knockout mouse (eNOS<sup>-/-</sup>), a model of FGR, to determine the ability of sildenafil, a potential new treatment for FGR, to improve cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in adult offspring following a complicated pregnancy. Pregnant eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> and C57BL/6J control dams were randomised to sildenafil treatment (0.2<U+2009>mg/ml in drinking water) or placebo at day 12.5 of gestation until birth. After weaning, male offspring were randomised to either a high fat (HFD; 45% kcal from fat) or normal chow diet (ND), and raised to either postnatal day 90 or 150. Growth and body composition, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, systolic blood pressure and vascular function were analysed at both time-points. eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> offspring were significantly smaller than their C57BL/6J controls at weaning and P90 (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01); at P150 they were a similar weight. Total adipose tissue deposition at P90 was significantly increased only in eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a HFD (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). At P150 both C57BL/6J and eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> offspring fed a HFD demonstrated significant adipose tissue deposition (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), regardless of maternal treatment. Both diet and maternal sildenafil treatment had a significant effect on glucose tolerance. Glucose tolerance was significantly impaired in eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a HFD (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01); this was significant in offspring from both sildenafil and vehicle treated mothers at P90 and P150. Glucose tolerance was also impaired in C57BL/6J mice fed a HFD at both P90 and P150 (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), but only in those also exposed to sildenafil. In these C57BL/6J mice, sildenafil was associated with impaired insulin sensitivity at P90 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.020) but increased insulin resistance at P150 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.019). Exposure to sildenafil was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure in eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with their C57BL/6J diet controls at P150 (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Exposure to sildenafil had differing effects on vascular function in mesenteric arteries; it increased vasodilation in response to ACh in C57BL/6J mice, but was associated with a more constrictive phenotype in eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> mice. eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> mice demonstrate a number of impaired outcomes consistent with programmed cardiometabolic disease, particularly when faced with the ‘second hit’ of a HFD. Exposure to sildenafil treatment during pregnancy did not increase fetal growth or significantly improve adult metabolic or cardiac outcomes. Maternal sildenafil treatment was, however, associated with small impairments in glucose handling and an increase in blood pressure. This study highlights the importance of understanding the long-term effects of treatment during pregnancy in offspring from both complicated and healthy control pregnancies.</p>

<p>Accumulating knowledge on the biology and function of the adipose tissue has led to a major shift in our understanding of its role in health and disease. The adipose tissue is now recognized as a crucial regulator of cardiovascular health, mediated by the secretion of several bioactive products, including adipocytokines, microvesicles and gaseous messengers, with a wide range of endocrine and paracrine effects on the cardiovascular system. The adipose tissue function and secretome are tightly controlled by complex homeostatic mechanisms and local cell-cell interactions, which can become dysregulated in obesity. Systemic or local inflammation and insulin resistance lead to a shift in the adipose tissue secretome from anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic towards a pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic profile. Moreover, the interplay between the adipose tissue and the cardiovascular system is bidirectional, with vascular-derived and heart-derived signals directly affecting adipose tissue biology. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge of the biology and regional variability of adipose tissue in humans, deciphering the complex molecular mechanisms controlling the crosstalk between the adipose tissue and the cardiovascular system, and their possible clinical translation. In addition, we highlight the latest developments in adipose tissue imaging for cardiovascular risk stratification and discuss how therapeutic targeting of the adipose tissue can improve prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Poultry researchers seek general and native lines of birds for capon production. The primary aim is to find high-quality meat with valuable sensory attributes. Castration decreases androgen levels and changes lipid metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of abdominal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular fat, which changes the flavor, texture, and tenderness of the meat. Histological analysis of selected skeletal muscles from Leghorn capons and cockerels was the main aim of the present study, along with examination of lipid localization in muscle tissue. We also assessed fiber type and diameter in the pectoral muscles (pectoralis major). The experiment was performed on 200 Leghorn cockerels; testes were removed at 8 wk of age. At 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 wk of age, 6 cockerels and 6 capons were slaughtered, and samples from the pectoral and thigh muscles were evaluated. Differences in the focal necrosis of the fibers with infiltration of lymphoid cells (P &lt; 0.05) were observed in thigh muscles, with higher numbers in cockerels than in capons. All examined locations in the pectoral and thigh muscles of capons (around the blood vessels, in the perimysium, in the endomysium, and in the sarcoplasm) showed higher concentrations of lipids compared to levels in cockerels. The analysis of fiber type in pectoralis major muscles revealed that all fibers were type IIB. The diameters of the fibers of the pectoral muscles were different (P &lt; 0.05) at 28 wk of age, and the diameters of the giant fibers were different (P &lt; 0.05) at 16 wk of age. The high concentration of lipids in the skeletal muscles of Leghorn capons is remarkable. Thus, ethical reasons as well as economic reasons should be considered when one-day-old cockerels are eliminated.</p>

<p>Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) have been shown to differentiate down many lineages including endothelial lineage. We hypothesized that hASCs would more efficiently differentiate toward the endothelial lineage when formed as three-dimensional (3D) spheroids and with the addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Three conditions were tested: uncoated tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) surfaces that induced a 2D monolayer formation; elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-collagen composite hydrogel scaffolds that induced encapsulated 3D spheroid culture; and ELP-polyethyleneimine-coated TCPS surfaces that induced 3D spheroid formation in scaffold-free condition. Cells were exposed to endothelial differentiation medium containing no additional VEGF or 20 and 50 ng/mL of VEGF for 7 days and assayed for viability and endothelial differentiation markers. While endothelial differentiation media supported endothelial differentiation of hASCs, our 3D spheroid cultures augmented this differentiation and produced more von Willebrand factor than 2D cultures. Likewise, 3D cultures were able to uptake LDL, whereas the 2D cultures were not. Higher concentrations of VEGF further enhanced differentiation. Establishing angiogenesis is a key factor in regenerative medicine.

<p>Mouse adipocytes have been reported to release aldosterone and reduce endothelium-dependent relaxation. It is unknown whether perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases aldosterone in humans. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that human PVAT releases aldosterone and induces endothelial dysfunction. Vascular reactivity was assessed in human internal mammary and renal segmental arteries obtained at surgery. The arteries were prepared with/without PVAT, and changes in isometric tension were measured in response to the vasoconstrictor thromboxane prostanoid receptor agonist U46619 and the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. The effects of exogenous aldosterone and of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist eplerenone were determined. Aldosterone concentrations were measured by ELISA in conditioned media incubated with human adipose tissue with/without angiotensin II stimulation. Presence of aldosterone synthase and MR mRNA was examined in perirenal, abdominal, and mammary PVAT by PCR. U46619 -induced tension and acetylcholine-induced relaxation were unaffected by exogenous and endogenous aldosterone (addition of aldosterone and MR blocker) in mammary and renal segmental arteries, both in the presence and absence of PVAT. Aldosterone release from incubated perivascular fat was not detectable. Aldosterone synthase expression was not consistently observed in human adipose tissues in contrast to that of MR. Thus, exogenous aldosterone does not affect vascular reactivity and endothelial function in ex vivo human arterial segments, and the tested human adipose tissues have no capacity to synthesize/release aldosterone. In perspective, physiologically relevant effects of aldosterone on vascular function in humans are caused by systemic aldosterone originating from the adrenal gland.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare, painful, and debilitating disorder of vascular calcification and skin necrosis that typically affects patients with advanced kidney disease. During our routine pathology practice, we noted several missed diagnoses on calciphylaxis consultation cases originating from outside institutions and sought to explore factors associated with false-negative pathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis.METHODS: The pathology database of a large tertiary academic medical center was retrospectively searched for “calciphylaxis” in inside reports on outside surgical consultation cases between 2007 and 2017. Inside and outside pathology reports were compared and medical records were searched for calciphylaxis clinical diagnosis and risk factors.RESULTS: Twenty-four calciphylaxis patients were identified, with median age of 63.5<U+2009>years. Seven of 24 (29%) of specimens were inadequate (e.g., lack of subcutaneous adipose tissue for evaluation). Eight of 17 (47%) of adequate specimens had a first false-negative pathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Histochemical staining for calcium significantly correlated with true-positive diagnosis (93% vs 55%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004). Dermatopathology fellowship training significantly correlated with true-positive diagnosis (82% vs 38%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.047).CONCLUSIONS: Adequate sampling, dermatopathology training, and use of histochemical stains to identify calcium associate with decreased false-negative rate for calciphylaxis diagnosis. These findings need further evaluation in larger prospective studies.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the retropubic space anatomy is essential for safe entry and surgical applications within this space.OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to examine the gross and histologic anatomy of the retropubic urethra, paraurethral tissue, and urethrovaginal space and to correlate findings to retropubic procedures.STUDY DESIGN: Anatomic relationships of the retropubic urethra were examined grossly in unembalmed female cadavers. Measured distances included: lateral urethral wall to arcus tendineus fascia pelvis at the level of urethrovesical junction and at 1 cm distal. Other measurements included retropubic urethral length and distances from internal urethral opening to each ureteric orifice. Microscopic examination was performed at the same levels examined grossly in separate nulliparous specimens. Descriptive statistics were used for data analyses.RESULTS: In all, 25 cadavers were examined grossly. Median distance from lateral urethral wall to arcus tendineus fascia pelvis at the level of urethrovesical junction was 25 mm (range, 13-38 mm). At 1 cm distal, the median distance from aforementioned structures was 14 mm (10-26 mm). Median length of the retropubic urethra was 23 mm (range 15-30 mm). Four nulliparous specimens, ages 12 weeks, and 34, 47, and 52 years, were examined histologically. No histologic evidence of a discrete fascial layer between bladder/urethra and anterior vagina was noted at any level examined. Tissue between the urethra and the pelvic sidewall skeletal muscle was composed of dense fibrous tissue, smooth muscle bundles, scant adipose tissue, blood vessels, and nerves. The smooth muscle fibers of the vaginal muscularis interdigitated with skeletal muscle fibers in the pelvic sidewall at both levels examined. No histologic evidence of “pubourethral ligaments” within the paraurethral tissue was noticed.CONCLUSION: A 2-cm “zone of safety” exists between the urethra and arcus tendineus fascia pelvis at the urethrovesical junction level. Suture or graft placement within this region should minimize injury to the urethra, pelvic sidewall muscles, and bladder. Knowledge that the shortest length of retropubic urethra was 1.5 cm and shortest urethra to arcus tendineus fascia pelvis distance was 1 cm highlights the importance of maintaining dissection and trocar entry site close to pubic bone to avoid bladder and/or urethral injury. Histologic analysis of paraurethral tissue supports the nonexistence of pubourethral ligaments.</p>

<p>Engineered adipose tissues are developed for their use as substitutes for tissue replacement in reconstructive surgery. To ensure a timely perfusion of the grafted substitutes, different strategies can be used such as the incorporation of an endothelial component. In this study, we engineered human adipose tissue substitutes comprising of functional adipocytes as well as a natural extracellular matrix using the self-assembly approach, without the use of exogenous scaffolding elements. Human microvascular endothelial cells (hMVECs) were incorporated during tissue production in vitro and we hypothesized that their presence would favor the early connection with the host vascular network translating into functional enhancement after implantation into nude mice in comparison to the substitutes that were not enriched in hMVECs. In vitro, no significant differences were observed between the substitutes in terms of histological aspects. After implantation, both groups presented numerous adipocytes and an abundant matrix in addition to the presence of host capillaries within the grafts. The substitutes thickness and volume were not significantly different between groups over the short-term time course of 14 days (d). For the microvascularized adipose tissues, human CD31 staining revealed a human capillary network connecting with the host microvasculature as early as 3 d after grafting. The detection of murine red blood cells within human CD31+ structures confirmed the functionality of the human capillary network. By analyzing the extent of the global vascularization achieved, a tendency towards increased total capillary network surface and volume was revealed for prevascularized tissues over 14 d. Therefore, applying this strategy on thicker reconstructed adipose tissues with rate-limiting oxygen diffusion might procure added benefits and prove useful to provide voluminous substitutes for patients suffering from adipose tissue loss or defects.</p>

<p>Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play essential roles in regulating blood vessel form and function and they are required for vascular tissue regeneration. Multipotent adipose derived stromal cells (ASCs) can be differentiated into VSMC-like cells, which can be used as a potential VSMC source for the development of vascular tissue. However, the effects of cryopreservation on the differentiation of ASCs towards VSMCs are poorly studied to date. This study compared fresh ASCs (FA) vs. cryopreserved ASCs (CA) with respect to their differentiation potential towards VSMC-like cells. The expression of contractile VSMC markers (such as smoothelin) and cell contractility were investigated. It was found that VSMC-like cells derived from CA expressed smoothelin gene and protein at lower levels and showed compromised contractility in response to vasoconstrictors, when compared with those derived from FA. Moreover, it was demonstrated that this negative effect of cryopreservation could be mediated by MEK1/2-ERK1/2, IFN<U+03B3> and Smad2/3 associated Signalling pathways. Treatment of CA with MEK1/2-ERK1/2 activator or IFN<U+03B3> neutralizing antibodies enhanced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and showed a rescue of the negative effect of cryopreservation on the differentiation of ASCs towards VSMC-like cells. These findings are important for defining approaches that may use cryopreserved ASCs for vascular tissue regeneration.</p>

<p>Considerable effort has been directed toward deriving endothelial cells (ECs) from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) since 2004, when it was first suggested that ECs and adipocytes share a common progenitor. While the capacity of ASCs to express endothelial markers has been repeatedly demonstrated, none constitute conclusive evidence of an endothelial phenotype as all reported markers have been detected in other, non-endothelial cell types. In this study, quantitative phenotypic comparisons to representative EC controls were used to determine the extent of endothelial differentiation being achieved with ASCs. ASCs were harvested from human subcutaneous abdominal white adipose tissue, and their endothelial differentiation was induced using well-established biochemical stimuli. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry were used to quantify their expression of endothelial genes and corresponding proteins, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively assess their uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL). Human umbilical vein, coronary artery, and dermal microvascular ECs were used as positive controls to reflect the phenotypic heterogeneity between ECs derived from different vascular beds. Biochemically conditioned ASCs were found to upregulate their expression of endothelial genes and proteins, as well as AcLDL uptake, but their abundance remained orders of magnitude lower than that observed in the EC controls despite their global proteomic heterogeneity. The findings of this investigation demonstrate the strikingly limited extent of endothelial differentiation being achieved with ASCs using well-established biochemical stimuli, and underscore the importance of quantitative phenotypic comparisons to representative primary cell controls in studies of differentiation.

<p>Artificial adipose tissue (AT) constructs are urgently needed to treat severe wounds, to replace removed tissue, or for the use as in vitro model to screen for potential drugs or study metabolic pathways. The clinical translation of products is mostly prevented by the absence of a vascular component that would allow a sustainable maintenance and an extension of the construct to a relevant size. With this study, we aimed to evaluate the suitability of a novel material based on bacterial cellulose (CBM) on the defined adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and the maintenance of the received adipocytes (diffASCs) and human microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs) in mono- and coculture. A slight acceleration of adipogenic differentiation over regular tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) was seen on CBM under defined conditions, whereas on the maintenance of the generated adipocytes, comparable effects were detected for both materials. CBM facilitated the formation of vascular-like structures in monoculture of mvECs, which was not observed on TCPS. By contrast, vascular-like structures were detected in CBM and TCPS in coculture by the presence of diffASCs. Concluding, CBM represents a promising material in vascularized AT engineering with the potential to speed up and simplify the in vitro setup of engineered products. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<p>Metabolic disorders such as obesity are accompanied by endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and decreased vascular density. The current paradigm posits that metabolic alterations associated with obesity secondarily lead to EC dysfunction. However, in view of recent evidence reporting that EC dysfunction per se is able to cause metabolic dysregulation, this paradigm should be revisited and further elaborated. In this article we summarize current views and discuss evidence in favor of a causal role for ECs in systemic metabolic dysregulation. We also integrate and contextualize current research in a pathophysiological framework and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting angiogenesis to help to counteract obesity.</p>

<p>The no-touch technique of saphenous vein harvesting involves harvesting the vein as a pedicled graft, together with its surrounding adipose tissue, while avoiding direct contact and excessive high-pressure expansion. This technique offers the possibility of comparable long-term graft patency to that of an internal mammary artery graft. However, the wound complications using the no-touch technique can be more significant than those using a conventional skeletonized technique. To solve the problem of leg wound trouble and to perform the no-touch saphenous vein harvesting more rapidly and efficiently, we have developed a new harvesting technique using a novel energy device, the THUNDERBEAT. This harvesting technique offers quicker tissue dissection, safer sealing of branch vessels, and fewer wound complications, without the risk of thermal damage to the graft.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling is dictated by coordinated interactions between adipocytes and resident stromal-vascular cells; however, the functional heterogeneity of adipose stromal cells has remained unresolved. We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and FACS to identify and isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of PDGFRß+ stromal cells within visceral WAT of adult mice. LY6C- CD9- PDGFRß+ cells represent highly adipogenic visceral adipocyte precursor cells (‘APCs’), whereas LY6C+ PDGFRß+ cells represent fibro-inflammatory progenitors (‘FIPs’). FIPs lack adipogenic capacity, display pro-fibrogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotypes, and can exert an anti-adipogenic effect on APCs. The pro-inflammatory phenotype of PDGFRß+ cells is regulated, at least in part, by NR4A nuclear receptors. These data highlight the functional heterogeneity of visceral WAT perivascular cells, and provide insight into potential cell-cell interactions impacting adipogenesis and inflammation. These improved strategies to isolate FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT will facilitate the study of physiological WAT remodeling and mechanisms leading to metabolic dysfunction.This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

<p>Overconsumption of a diet rich in fat and carbohydrates, called the Western diet, is a major contributor to the global epidemic of cardiovascular disease. Despite previously documented cardiovascular protection exhibited in female rats, this safeguard may be lost under certain metabolic stressors. We hypothesized that female Wistar rats challenged by a Western diet composed of 21% fat and 50% carbohydrate (34.1% sucrose) for 17 wk would develop endothelial dysfunction via endothelial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Western diet-fed female rats exhibited dysregulation of metabolism, revealing increased body weight and abdominal fat, decreased expression of adiponectin in white adipose tissue, glucose intolerance, and impaired insulin sensitivity. Western diet exposure increased hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol alongside hepatic steatosis, categorizing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, a Western diet negatively affected vascular function, revealing hypertension, impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, aortic remodeling, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Aortic protein expression of TLR4 and its downstream proteins were markedly increased in the Western diet-fed group in association with elevated serum levels of free fatty acids. In vitro experiments were conducted to test whether free fatty acids contribute to vascular ROS overproduction via the TLR4 signaling pathway. Cultured endothelial cells were stimulated with palmitate in the presence of TAK-242, a TLR4 signaling inhibitor. Palmitate-induced overgeneration of ROS in endothelial cells was abolished in the presence of TAK-242. Our data show that a Western diet induced endothelial dysfunction in female rats and suggest that endothelial TLR4 signaling may play a key role in abolishing female cardiovascular protection. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY A Western diet induced elevated levels of free fatty acids, produced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and provoked endothelial dysfunction in female rats in association with Toll-like receptor 4 signaling-mediated vascular reactive oxygen species production. Limited consumption of a Western diet in premenopausal women may decrease their risk of cardiovascular complications.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The content of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in adipose tissue is considered a long-term biomarker for the body’s endogenous exposure to seafood.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine associations between the content of marine n-3 PUFAs in adipose tissue and the risk of incident peripheral arterial disease (PAD).METHODS: In this case-cohort study based on data from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort, adipose tissue biopsies were taken from the buttocks of all participants at baseline. After a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 870 validated cases of PAD were identified and included together with a randomly drawn subcohort of 3,204 participants using weighted Cox regression. Adipose tissue samples were analyzed by gas chromatography.RESULTS: In multivariable analyses using the lowest quintile as the reference and adjusting for established risk factors for PAD, we found a statistically significant lower rate of PAD in the highest quintile of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41 to 0.74) and a nonsignificant lower rate for docosahexaenoic acid (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.06). We observed a lower rate of PAD, when comparing the highest quintile of the combined EPA and docosahexaenoic acid with the reference (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.96). In contrast, docosapentaenoic acid had an HR of 1.31 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.77) in the highest quintile.CONCLUSIONS: A high content of marine n-3 PUFAs in adipose tissue, in particular EPA, was associated with a lower risk of incident PAD.</p>

<p>Hepatic and myocardial ectopic lipid deposition has been associated with insulin resistance (IR) and cardiovascular risk. Lipid overload promotes increased hepatic oxidative capacity, oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial efficiency, driving the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We hypothesized that higher lipid availability promotes ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction and decreases myocardial mitochondrial efficiency. Mice with adipose tissue-specific overexpression of sterol element-binding protein 1c as model of lipid overload with combined NAFLD-IR and controls underwent reperfused acute myocardial infarcts (AMIs). Whereas indexes of left ventricle (LV) contraction were similar in both groups at baseline, NAFLD-IR showed severe myocardial dysfunction post-AMI, with prominent LV reshaping and increased end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. Hearts of NAFLD-IR displayed hypertrophy, steatosis, and IR due to 18:1/18:1-diacylglycerol-mediated protein kinase Ce (PKCe) activation. Myocardial fatty acid-linked respiration and oxidative stress were increased, whereas mitochondrial efficiency was decreased. In humans, decreased myocardial mitochondrial efficiency of ventricle biopsies related to IR and troponin levels, a marker of impaired myocardial integrity. Taken together, increased lipid availability and IR favor susceptibility to ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction. The diacylglycerol-PKCe pathway and reduced mitochondrial efficiency both caused by myocardial lipotoxicity may contribute to the impaired LV compensation of the noninfarcted region of the myocardium.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adult stem cells appear to be a promising subject for tissue engineering, representing an individual material for regeneration of aged and damaged cells. Especially adipose derived stromal cells (ADSC), which are easily to achieve, allow an encouraging perspective due to their capability of differentiating into miscellaneous cell types. Here we describe the in vitro formation of human subcutaneous, visceral and omental ADSC micromasses and compare their histological attributes while being cultivated on collagen membranes.METHODS: Subcutaneous, visceral and omental fat tissue derived cells were isolated and processed according to standard protocols. Positively stained cells for CD13, CD44 and CD90 were cultivated on agarose in order to study micromass formation using a special method of cell tracking. Stained paraffin-embedded micromasses were analysed morphologically before and after being plated on collagen membranes.RESULTS: The micromass formation process was similar in all three tissue types. Subcutaneous fat tissue derived micromasses turned out to develop a more homogeneous and compact shape than visceral and omental tissue. Nevertheless all micromasses adhered to collagen membranes with visible spreading of cells. The immune histochemical (IHC) staining of subcutaneous, visceral and omental ADSC micromasses shows a constant expression of CD13 and a decrease of CD44 and CD 90 expression within 28 days. After that period, omental fat cells don’t show any expression of CD44.CONCLUSION: In conclusion micromass formation and cultivation of all analysed fat tissues can be achieved, subcutaneous cells appearing to be the best material for regenerative concepts.</p>

<p>Clinical studies have shown that obesity negatively impacts large arteries’ function. We reported that rats exposed to maternal separation (MatSep), a model of early life stress, display enhanced angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced vasoconstriction in aortic rings cleaned of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) under normal diet (ND) conditions. We hypothesized that exposure to MatSep promotes a greater loss of PVAT-mediated protective effects on vascular function and loss of blood pressure (BP) rhythm in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) when compared with controls. MatSep was performed in male Wistar-Kyoto rats from days 2 to 14 of life. Normally reared littermates served as controls. On ND, aortic rings from MatSep rats with PVAT removed showed increased ANG II-mediated vasoconstriction versus controls; however, rings from MatSep rats with intact PVAT displayed blunted constriction. This effect was exacerbated by an HFD in both groups; however, the anticontractile effect of PVAT was greater in MatSep rats. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was similar in MatSep and control rats fed an ND, regardless of the presence of PVAT. HFD impaired aortic relaxation in rings without PVAT from MatSep rats, whereas the presence of PVAT improved relaxation in both groups. On an HFD, immunolocalization of vascular smooth muscle-derived ANG-(1-7) and PVAT-derived adiponectin abundances were increased in MatSep. In rats fed an HFD, 24-h BP and BP rhythms were similar between groups. In summary, MatSep enhanced the ability of PVAT to blunt the heightened ANG II-induced vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction in rats fed an HFD. This protective effect may be mediated via the upregulation of vasoprotective factors within the adipovascular axis.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE To evaluate effects of various concentrations of collagenase and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on yield of equine adipose-derived multipotent stromal cells (ASCs) before and after cryopreservation. SAMPLE Supragluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue from 7 Thoroughbreds. PROCEDURES Tissues were incubated with digests containing 0.1%, 0.05%, or 0.025% type I collagenase. Part of each resulting stromal vascular fraction was cryopreserved in 80% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% DMSO, and 10% Dulbecco modified Eagle medium F-12 and in 95% FBS and 5% DMSO. Half of each fresh and cryopreserved heterogeneous cell population was not immunophenotyped (unsorted) or was immunophenotyped for CD44<sup>+</sup>, CD105<sup>+</sup>, and major histocompatability complex class II (MHCII; CD44<sup>+</sup>-CD105<sup>+</sup>-MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells and CD44<sup>+</sup>-CD105<sup>+</sup>-MHCII<sup>-</sup> cells). Cell proliferation (cell viability assay), plasticity (CFU frequency), and lineage-specific target gene and oncogene expression (reverse transcriptase PCR assays) were determined in passage 1 cells before and after culture in induction media. RESULTS Digestion with 0.1% collagenase yielded the highest number of nucleated cells. Cell surface marker expression and proliferation rate were not affected by collagenase concentration. Cryopreservation reduced cell expansion rate and CD44<sup>+</sup>-CD105<sup>+</sup>-MHCII<sup>-</sup> CFUs; it also reduced osteogenic plasticity of unsorted cells. However, effects appeared to be unrelated to DMSO concentrations. There were also variable effects on primordial gene expression among cell isolates. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results supported the use of 0.1% collagenase in an adipose tissue digest and 5% DMSO in cryopreservation medium for isolation and cryopreservation, respectively, of equine ASCs. These results may be used as guidelines for standardization of isolation and cryopreservation procedures for equine ASCs.</p>

<p>Histologic and radiologic studies describe intramyocardial fat tissue as a normal finding or as part of cardiac pathology. The role of fat cells within the myocardium is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess fat tissue distribution in the myocardium of right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) and age differences in subjects free from cardiac disease. The study included 10 males without cardiac disease divided into two groups according to age (below/above 50 years). Three cross sections were performed (RV free wall and apex and RA free wall) with histomorphological analysis on digital photographs. The shares of total myocardial fat (TMF), peri-vascular fat (PVF) and non-perivascular (nPVF) fat were calculated. Samples from the older group had larger amounts of fat in the epicardium and myocardium, without statistically significant differ-ence (TMF p=0.847, PVF p=0.4 and nPVF p=0.4). The largest quantities of fat tissue were found in the RV apex samples (14.9%), followed by RV free wall (7.5%) and RA (4.5%), where total apical RV fat share was significantly larger than in RA sample (p=0.044). Intramyocardial fat cells were present within the non-diseased RA and RV in all samples, mostly in the apex. Further investigations on age difference, effect of visceral obesity and sex differences are needed.</p>

<p>Autologous adipose tissue is used for tissue repletion and/or regeneration as an intact lipoaspirate or as enzymatically derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which may be first cultured into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Alternatively, transplant of autologous adipose tissue mechanically fragmented into submillimeter clusters has recently showed remarkable efficacy in diverse therapeutic indications. To document the biologic basis of the regenerative potential of microfragmented adipose tissue, we first analyzed the distribution of perivascular presumptive MSCs in adipose tissue processed with the Lipogems technology, observing a significant enrichment in pericytes, at the expense of adventitial cells, as compared to isogenic enzymatically processed lipoaspirates. The importance of MSCs as trophic and immunomodulatory cells, due to the secretion of specific factors, has been described. Therefore, we investigated protein secretion by cultured adipose tissue clusters or enzymatically derived SVF using secretome arrays. In culture, microfragmented adipose tissue releases many more growth factors and cytokines involved in tissue repair and regeneration, noticeably via angiogenesis, compared to isogenic SVF. Therefore, we suggest that the efficient tissue repair/regeneration observed after transplantation of microfragmented adipose tissue is due to the secretory ability of the intact perivascular niche.

<p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a powerful neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, is a key regulator of angiogenesis and biology of adipose depots. Intriguingly, its peripheral vascular and angiogenic powerful activity is strictly associated to platelets, which are source of clinical hemoderivates, such as platelet lysate (PL), routinely employed in several clinical applications as wound healing, and to preserve ex vivo the progenitor properties of the adipose stromal cells pool. So far, the presence of NPY in PL and its biological effects on the adipose stromal cell fraction (ASCs) have never been investigated. Here, we aimed to identify endogenous sources of NPY such as PL-based preparations and to investigate which biological properties PL-derived NPY is able to exert on ASCs. The results show that PL contains a high amount of NPY, which is in part also excreted by ASCs when stimulated with PL. The protein levels of the three main NPY subtype receptors (Y1, Y2, Y5) are unaltered by stimulation of ASCs with PL, but their inhibition through selective pharmacological antagonists, considerably enhances migration, and a parallel reduction of angiogenic features of ASCs including decrease in VEGF mRNA and intracellular calcium levels, both downstream targets of NPY. The expression of VEGF and NPY is enhanced within the sites of neovascularisation of difficult wounds in patients after treatment with leuco-platelet concentrates. Our data highlight the presence of NPY in PL preparations and its peripheral effects on adipose progenitors.</p>

<p>Purpose To evaluate phase-contrast CT as a noninvasive alternative to histology in the study of ancient soft tissue. Materials and Methods The imaging was performed between May 8 and June 13, 2017. A mummified human hand from ancient Egypt was imaged in a laboratory phase-contrast CT arrangement with propagation-based imaging. The experimental arrangement for propagation-based imaging included a microfocus x-ray source, a rotation stage for the sample, and an x-ray detector. The mummified hand was imaged in two different modes. First, a CT scan of the whole hand was performed in an overview arrangement. Then, a detailed scan of the tip of the middle finger was performed. With imaging distances tailored for a large magnification and to maximize the phase-contrast signal, the estimated resolution in the final images was 6-9 µm. Results The overview CT allowed identification of the tendons of the hand, as well as identification of arteries and nerves in the dehydrated soft tissue. In the detailed phase-contrast setting, virtual histology of the soft tissues of the fingertip could be performed. Blood vessels in the nail bed and the microanatomy of the bone marrow and hypodermis were imaged, and the layers of the skin could be distinguished. Round structures in the adipose tissue were identified as the remains of adipocytes. Conclusion Laboratory phase-contrast CT enables imaging of the anatomy and microanatomy of mummified soft tissue with sub-10-µm resolution and may serve as a complement or alternative to the classic invasive histologic methods used in soft-tissue paleopathology. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity and lipodystrophy results in major health complications such as heart disease and stroke, and is associated with an increased risk of some cancers. We have previously found that the cell surface receptor CD24 regulates adipogenesis as measured by lipid accumulation and gene expression in mature adipocytes. How CD24 regulates these processes remains unknown. To begin answering this question, we first determined that CD24 does not affect glucose uptake in differentiating adipocytes in vitro. We then examined changes in global gene expression via DNA microarray in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with siRNA-mediated knock-down of CD24 expression. We found that CD24 expression is necessary for upregulation of up to 134 genes. We validated the CD24-mediated regulation of 4 of these genes during in vitro adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 and primary cells isolated from the inguinal white adipose tissue depots of CD24 knockout mice. Surprisingly, we found that only 1 of these genes was also regulated by CD24 in cells from the epididymal depot. Overall, these data suggest that CD24 is necessary for select gene expression in a depot-specific manner during adipogenesis in vitro. These findings could help elucidate the mechanisms regulating lipid accumulation in adipocytes thereby aiding in the development of novel treatment strategies for obesity and lipodystophy.</p>

<p>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) was first identified as a blood pressure regulator, modulating renal sodium handling in response to its principal ligand aldosterone. The mineralocorticoid receptor is also expressed in many tissues other than the kidney, such as adipose tissue, heart and vasculature. Recent studies have shown that MR plays a relevant role in the control of cardiovascular and metabolic function, as well as in adipogenesis. Dysregulation of aldosterone/MR signaling represents an important cause of disease as high plasma levels of aldosterone are associated with hypertension, obesity and increased cardiovascular risk. Aldosterone displays powerful vascular effects and acts as a potent pro-fibrotic agent in cardiovascular remodeling. Mineralocorticoid receptor activation regulates genes involved in vascular and cardiac fibrosis, calcification and inflammation. This review focuses on the role of novel potential biomarkers related to aldosterone/MR system that could help identify cardiovascular and metabolic detrimental conditions, as a result of altered MR activation. Specifically, we discuss: (1) how MR signaling regulates the number and function of different subpopulations of circulating and intra-tissue immune cells; (2) the role of aldosterone/MR system in mediating cardiometabolic diseases induced by obesity; and (3) the role of several MR downstream molecules as novel potential biomarkers of cardiometabolic diseases, end-organ damage and rehabilitation outcome.</p>

<p>An otherwise healthy 20-year-old male presented with an exophytic, polypoid, yellowish lesion involving the dorsal surface of his tongue, which he reported being present since birth and unchanged. This was removed by surgical excision and diagnosed as a leiomyomatous hamartoma. Histological examination revealed a combination of fibrovascular connective tissue, conspicuous smooth-muscle bundles, adipose tissue, minor salivary gland tissue, blood vessels, lymphoid tissue, peripheral nerves, and normal skeletal muscle. This case is exceptional due to the patient’s age, as until now, lingual leiomyomatous hamartomas have been reported almost exclusively in a paediatric population. To our knowledge, this is the eldest age at which a LLH has been reported in the literature. This underscores the need for clinicians to consider this rarely reported entity when considering the radiographic and clinical differential diagnoses for these lesions, both in the paediatric and adult populations. We also present a review of the literature regarding lingual leiomyomatous hamartomas.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Obesity leads to a chronic inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension.OBJECTIVE: To establish the time-course of events regarding inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, systolic blood pressure (SBP) in obesity in only one experimental model.METHODS: We fed male Wistar rats (eight-week age) with a standard diet (Control - CT, n = 35), or palatable high-fat diet (HFD, n = 35) for 24 weeks. Every six weeks, 7 animals from each group were randomly selected for euthanasia. SBP and serum levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, C-reactive protein, adiponectin and nitric oxide were determined. Endothelial and vascular smooth muscle functions were determined in dissected aorta and lipid peroxidation was measured. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.RESULTS: Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines began to increase after six weeks of a high-fat diet, while those of the anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin decreased. Interestingly, the endothelial function and serum nitric oxide began to decrease after six weeks in HFD group. The SBP and lipid peroxidation began to increase at 12 weeks in HFD group. In addition, we showed that total visceral fat mass was negatively correlated with endothelial function and positively correlated with SBP.CONCLUSION: Our results show the time-course of deleterious effects and their correlation with obesity.</p>

<p>Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) is one of the anti-inflammatory adipokines secreted from white adipose tissue. However, little is known about the effect of SFRP5 on the cardiovascular system. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of SFRP5 on smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration and inflammation. The plasma levels of SFRP5 were evaluated in a cohort-based elderly population using ELISA, and the expression of SFRP5 in Sprague-Dawley rat aortas was detected using immunohistochemistry. SMC proliferation and migration were evaluated in vitro using 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine cell proliferation and wound-healing assays, respectively, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell signaling were assessed using a 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay and immunoblotting, respectively. The results revealed that plasma levels of SFRP5 were positively correlated with age in the elderly Chinese cohort. Similarly, aorta SFRP5 expression was significantly higher in 15-month-old rats compared with 6-month-old rats. In vitro, SFRP5 significantly inhibited rat aortic SMC proliferation and migration that were induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, as well as inhibiting ROS generation. Compared with the effect of PDGF-BB on SMCs, SFRP5 at 100 and 200 ng/ml significantly decreased SMC proliferation by 31.5 and 34.8%, respectively (P&lt;0.05). SFRP5 at 100 and 200 ng/ml also inhibited the migration of SMCs by 24.9 and 28.4%, respectively, when compared with the effects of PDGF-BB. SFRP5 attenuated the PDGF-BB-induced expression of ß-catenin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, while p38 phosphorylation was significantly attenuated. Together, the present results suggested that SFRP5 may inhibit SMC proliferation, migration and inflammation by suppressing the Wnt/ß-catenin and p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.</p>

<p>Significant advances in our understanding of human obesity, endocrinology, and metabolism have been made possible by murine comparative models, in which anatomically analogous fat depots are utilized; however, current research has questioned how truly analogous these depots are. In this study, we assess the validity of the analogy from the perspective of cellular architecture. Whole tissue mounting, confocal microscopy, and image reconstruction software were used to characterize the three-dimensional structure of the inguinal fat pad in mice, gluteofemoral fat in humans, and subcutaneous adipose tissue of the human abdominal wall. Abdominal and gluteofemoral adipose tissue specimens from 12 human patients and bilateral inguinal fat pads from 12 mice were stained for adipocytes, blood vessels, and a putative marker for adipose-derived multipotent progenitor cells, cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34). Samples were whole-mounted and imaged with laser scanning confocal microscopy. Expectedly, human adipocytes were larger and demonstrated greater size heterogeneity. Mouse fat displayed significantly higher vascular density compared with human fat when normalized to adipocyte count. There was no significant difference in the concentration of CD34-positive (CD34<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells from either species. However, the mean distance between CD34<sup>+</sup> stromal cells and blood vessels was significantly greater in human fat. Finally, mouse inguinal fat contained larger numbers of brown adipocytes than did human gluteofemoral or human abdominal fat. Overall, the basic architecture of human adipose tissue differs significantly from that of mice. Insofar as human gluteofemoral fat differs from human abdominal adipose tissue, it was closer to mouse inguinal fat, being its comparative developmental analog. These differences likely confer variance in functional properties between the two sources and thus must be considered when designing murine models of human disease.</p>

<p>The use of stem cells in regenerative medicine and specifically facial rejuvenation is thought provoking and controversial. Today there is increased emphasis on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, which translates into a need for a reliable source of stem cells in addition to biomaterial scaffolds and cytokine growth factors. Adipose tissue is currently recognized as an accessible and abundant source for adult stem cells. Cellular therapies and tissue engineering are still in their infancy, and additional basic science and preclinical studies are needed before cosmetic and reconstructive surgical applications can be routinely undertaken and satisfactory levels of patient safety achieved.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) is implicated in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a vasoactive neuropeptide expressed in joint tissues and synovial tissues (ST), was recently found to be associated with KOA progression and pain. CGRP is expressed in the IFPs of human KOA patients; however, its regulation has not been elucidated.METHODS: IFPs and STs were harvested from 138 KOA patients during total knee replacement (TKR) and analyzed for CGRP, cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2), and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To investigate CGRP regulation by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), adipocytes (Ad) and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) were harvested from IFPs using collagenase. Synovial cells (SYC) were also harvested from ST and stimulated with vehicle (serum-free culture medium), PGE2, or CGRP.RESULTS: CGRP, COX-2, and mPGES-1 expression levels were significantly higher in IFPs than STs. PGE2 stimulation increased CGRP expression in Ad, the SVF, and SYC; however, CGRP expression was significantly higher in PGE2-stimulated SVF than PGE2-stimulated SYC. CGRP stimulation had no effect on COX-2 or mPGES-1 expression.CONCLUSIONS: CGRP expression in the IFP of KOA patients is regulated by the COX-2/mPGES-1/PGE2 pathway.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND Epicardial fat tissue (EAT) acts as brown adipose tissue and protects the heart and coronary arteries against hypothermia. Recent studies demonstrated that EAT is a source of both anti-inflammatory and atherogenic cytokines. In this study, our aim was to investigate the association of vertical, horizontal, and area measurements of EAT thickness and their association with coronary artery disease, diastolic function, and myocardial performance index in patients who underwent coronary angiography. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study population consisted of patients who presented to our outpatient clinic with chest pain and whose non-invasive stress tests were positive between June 2015 and July 2017. Echocardiographic examinations were performed prior to the angiography. Coronary angiograms were performed using Judkins method from the femoral artery. RESULTS Mean vertical thickness of EAT was 0.6 cm in patients with CAD and 0.46 cm in those without CAD (p=0.0001). Mean horizontal length of EAT was 2.91 cm in patients with CAD and was 2.41 cm in the subjects without CAD (p=0.001). ROC analysis showed 81% sensitivity and 53% specificity for a cut-off value of 0.45, and 67% sensitivity and 71% specificity for a cut-off value of 0.55 for EAT vertical (cm). Multivariate analysis showed that EAT is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS Echocardiography is an inexpensive routine assessment for most patients. EAT thickness determined by echocardiography may be a useful indicator of increased CAD risk, but not diastolic dysfunction, of the left ventricle.</p>

<p>Tissue engineering is a very promising field of regenerative medicine. Life expectancy has been increasing, and tissue replacement is increasingly needed in patients suffering from various degenerative disorders of the organs. The use of adult mesenchymal stem cells (e.g. from adipose tissue or from bone marrow) in tissue engineering seems to be a promising approach for tissue replacements. Clinical applications can make direct use of the large secretome of these cells, which can have a positive influence on other cells around. Another advantage of adult mesenchymal stem cells is the possibility to differentiate them into various mature cells via appropriate culture conditions (i.e. medium composition, biomaterial properties, and dynamic conditions). This review is focused on current and future ways to carry out tissue replacement of damaged bones and blood vessels, especially with the use of suitable adult mesenchymal stem cells as a potential source of differentiated mature cells that can later be used for tissue replacement. The advantages and disadvantages of different stem cell sources are discussed, with a main focus on adipose-derived stem cells. Patient factors that can influence later clinical applications are taken into account.</p>

<p>We attempted to investigate the mechanism and susceptibility genes for diabetes in Han and Kazak ethnic individuals.The abdominal omental adipose tissues were obtained from diabetic cases and healthy controls. The gene expression and methylation data were produced for Kazak and Han individuals, respectively, and analyzed by bioinformatics analysis.We obtained 921 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Han group and 1772 in Kazak group. DEGs in Han group were significantly related with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and biosynthesis of amino acids, while the DEGs specific to Kazak patients were significantly enriched in metabolism-related pathways such as carbon metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism. Major facilitator superfamily domain containing 1 (MFSD1) was found to be a methylation associated gene at hypermethylation site of cg16289538 in Han group. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (ARHGEF1) was the susceptible gene corresponding to the methylation sites of cg18800192 and cg00759295 in Kazak group. ARHGEF1 was also a node in protein-protein interaction network and significantly enriched in hsa04270: vascular smooth muscle contraction pathways.The molecular mechanism of diabetes may be different in Han and Kazak patients. MFSD1 and ARHGEF1 may be the diabetes susceptible genes.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Characteristics and risk factors associated with electrocardiographic borderline Q-waves are not fully elucidated, especially in individuals without overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Also, the relation of isolated and non-isolated borderline Q-waves with subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness is unknown.CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular risk factors and measures of body fat, especially abdominal adiposity, were higher in participants with isolated borderline Q-waves, compared with no Q-waves, and highest in the non-isolated borderline Q-wave group. Non-isolated borderline Q-waves were associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness. Future studies should investigate potential added value of borderline Q-waves in CVD prediction.</p>

<p>Obesity often causes systemic metabolic disorders in close association with adipose tissue dysfunction. Adipose tissue contains well-developed vasculatures, and obesity mediates vascular rarefaction that causes hypoxia and triggers inflammation in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue-derived neuregulin-4 (Nrg4) is an immerging factor that is critically involved in metabolic homeostasis. We recently identified that Nrg4 is an angiogenic adipokine that plays an important role in maintaining adipose tissue vasculature. Here, we further validated its beneficial role in metabolic health primarily by enhancing adipose tissue angiogenesis. Targeted activation of Nrg4 in adipocytes improved metabolic health in mice under both normal and high fat dietary condition without changes in body weight. Activation of Nrg4 increased blood vessels in white adipose tissue, and ameliorated adipose tissue hypoxia under obese condition. Of note, inhibition of angiogenesis by sugen-treatment abolished the beneficial effects of Nrg4 on systemic metabolic health. Furthermore, targeted inhibition of Nrg4-ErbB signaling in adipose tissue vasculature using prohibitin binding peptide-conjugated nanocarrier abrogated the enhanced adipose tissue angiogenesis, and canceled the improved metabolic health induced by Nrg4 activation. These data further support a crucial role of Nrg4 in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis at least partially through enhancing adipose tissue angiogenesis.</p>

<p>Breast cancer represents the main malignancy in women and autologous fat grafting is a diffuse procedure in the management of post-surgical breast defects causing patients’ psychosocial problems, with high costs for the public health. Recently, beneficial effects of fat grafting during post-surgical breast reconstruction have been amplified from the enrichment with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) present in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adult adipose tissue isolated during intraoperatory procedures. The major concern about the ASC enrichment during post-surgery breast reconstruction depends on their potential ability to release growth factors and hormones that can promote proliferation of residual or quiescent cancer cells, with the risk of de novo cancer development or recurrence. The recent description that adult stem cells primed in vitro may be vehicle for anti-cancer drug delivery offers a new vision concerning the role of ASCs in breast reconstruction after cancer surgery. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent acting as a microtubule-stabilizing drug inhibiting cancer cell mitotic activity. We optimized PTX loading and release in cultured ASCs and then analyzed the effects of PTX-loaded ASCs and their conditioned medium on CG5 breast cancer survival, proliferation and apoptosis in vitro, and inCG5 xenograft in vivo. We documented that ASCs can uptake and release PTX in vitro, with slight cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, PTX-loaded ASCs in co-culture, as well as conditioned medium alone, inhibited CG5 cell proliferation and survival in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. The antitumor effect of PTX-loaded ASCs may offer a new perspective concerning the use of ASCs during breast reconstruction becoming an additional local preventive chemotherapeutic agent against tumor recurrence. However, further experiments in vitro and in vivo are needed to collect more evidence confirming the efficacy and safety in cancer patients.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Recent research on stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has demonstrated the presence of numerous growth factors that aid in tissue regeneration and suggest the potential for scar treatment. This study was conducted to clinically show that adding stem cells can improve the surgical outcomes of scar formation.METHODS: Between March 2014 and February 2016, 17 patients underwent injections of fat and highly condensed SVF simultaneously with scar reduction surgeries and 15 patients received scar revision with or without simultaneous application of highly condensed SVF (4.90<U+2009>×<U+2009>107 stem cells/ml) at our institution. Clinical photographs were taken before and after surgery, and the scars were graded using the following standard scales: the Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS), Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES), Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS).RESULTS: All patients showed improvement, registering significant increases in scar tissue scores (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05 in all four scoring systems). Patients in the SVF group showed more improved outcomes than patients in the non-SVF group for all scar tissue scores except the SBSES (OSAS, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.029; SBSES, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.281; VSS, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001; VAS, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.021). Subcategories of these scales reflected more favorable outcomes in terms of height and pliability; however, there was no significant change in vascularity.CONCLUSIONS: SVF injections enhance tissue regeneration by contributing stem cells and growth factors to improve outcomes in scar revisions or tissue grafts. Harvesting the SVF through liposuction also provides a cosmetic benefit. Significant SVF-related gains in the scoring of scars indicate the merit of SVF as an aspect of conventional scar management.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

<p>INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness and central arterial pressure are important factors in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. The tendency of patients after liver transplantation to reach above-normal BMI values promotes the development of arterial stiffness and lipid disorders.METHODS: The study was conducted on a group of 42 patients after liver transplantation at the Nephrology and Transplantology Outpatient Clinic, Medical University of Warsaw, the Infant Jesus Teaching Hospital, Warsaw 0.5-17 years after surgery. The body composition test was carried out with the Tanita Mc780 device, and the central pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV) with the Schiller BR-102 PLUS PWA device, using the oscillometric method on the brachial artery. Medical documentation was analyzed and the laboratory parameters values routinely determined during follow-up visits were assessed.RESULTS: There was a statistically significant correlation between central diastolic pressure and BMI (r = 0.46, P &lt; .05), and a lack of correlation between patients’ age and PWV value (r = 0.06, P &lt; .05), which indicated the age of patients in this study was not associated the stiffness of their arteries. PWV level in patients after liver transplantation whose BMI value is within the normal range was 7.62 m/s, while overweight and obese patients had PVW values of 8.58 m/s (P &lt; .05).CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data indicate that 1. the level of central arterial pressure increases with the development of stiffness in the arteries; 2. patients after liver transplantation tend to grow in terms of body weight and body fat content over time after surgery; and 3. the level of bilirubin in the blood is significantly increased among patients with fat content above the upper limit of the normal range.</p>

<p>Ozone is a strong oxidant, highly unstable atmospheric gas. Its medical use at low concentrations has been progressively increasing as an alternative/adjuvant treatment for several diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of mild ozonisation on human adipose-derived adult stem (hADAS) cells i.e., mesenchymal stem cells occurring in the stromal-vascular fraction of the fat tissue and involved in the tissue regeneration processes. hADAS cells were induced to differentiate into the adipoblastic lineage, and the effect of low ozone concentrations on the adipogenic process was studied by combining histochemical, morphometric and ultrastructural analyses. Our results demonstrate that ozone treatment promotes lipid accumulation in hADAS without inducing deleterious effects, thus paving the way to future studies aimed at elucidating the effect of mild ozonisation on adipose tissue for tissue regeneration and engineering.</p>

<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vascular signaling molecule that plays a role in vascular homeostasis. A reduction in NO bioavailability is thought to contribute to endothelial dysfunction, an early risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Dietary nitrate, through the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, may provide an alternate source of NO when the endogenous eNOS system is compromised. In addition to a role in the vascular system, NO may also play a role in the metabolic syndrome including obesity and glucose tolerance.</AbstractText>: Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vascular signaling molecule that plays a role in vascular homeostasis.

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) refers to the local aggregate of adipose tissue surrounding the vascular tree, exhibiting phenotypes from white to brown and beige adipocytes. Although PVAT has long been regarded as simply a structural unit providing mechanical support to vasculature, it is now gaining reputation as an integral endocrine/paracrine component, in addition to the well-established modulator endothelium, in regulating vascular tone. Since the discovery of anti-contractile effect of PVAT in 1991, the use of multiple rodent models of reduced amounts of PVAT has revealed its regulatory role in vascular remodeling and cardiovascular implications, including atherosclerosis. PVAT does not only release PVAT-derived relaxing factors (PVRFs) to activate multiple subsets of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potassium channels and anti-inflammatory signals in the vasculature, but it does also provide an interface for neuron-adipocyte interactions in the vascular wall to regulate arterial vascular tone. In this review, we outline our current understanding towards PVAT and attempt to provide hints about future studies that can sharpen the therapeutic potential of PVAT against cardiovascular diseases and their complications.</p>

<p>The practice of any sport is inherently associated with the risk of musculoskeletal lesions. We describe regenerative medicine technologies, including cellular therapies, gene therapies and multimolecular preparations of growth factors and cytokines, which are expected to advance the field of orthopaedics and sports medicine. Gene therapy involves the introduction of genetic information in the injured tissue to help that tissue to heal and, possibly, regenerate. Cell therapies used in clinical practice are based on the transplantation of adult human cells, which can be at different stages of differentiation. Currently, the stromal vascular fraction, containing stem cells and other niche components, has been injected in the articular cartilage of the knee or delivered via arthroscopy. Bone marrow concentrate (BMC) has been used to manage focal chondral defects via arthroscopy with promising clinical results. In addition, purified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been injected or delivered as an adjuvant to arthroscopic microfractures, and patients have shown improved clinical outcomes. Laboratory-expanded MSCs injected in osteoarthritis moderately improved pain and functional outcomes. MSC treatment in the form of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or BMC or laboratory expanded adhesive cells (bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, BM-MSCs and ADSCs) has been proven to be safe. Despite their safety, expensive regulatory complexities required to implement cell-based therapies make these treatments unavailable for most patients. At present, although some results are promising, all biological interventions are experimental, and cost/efficacy has not been demonstrated yet. Moreover, short follow-up in most studies questions the durability of treatments.</p>

Perivascular fat attenuation mapping was done around the three major coronary arteries-the proximal right coronary artery, the left anterior descending artery, and the left circumflex artery. We assessed the prognostic value of perivascular fat attenuation mapping for all-cause and cardiac mortality in Cox regression models, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, tube voltage, modified Duke coronary artery disease index, and number of coronary CTA-derived high-risk plaque features.Between 2005 and 2009, 1872 participants in the derivation cohort underwent coronary CTA (median age 62 years [range 17-89]). Between 2008 and 2016, 2040 patients in the validation cohort had coronary CTA (median age 53 years [range 19-87]). Median follow-up was 72 months (range 51-109) in the derivation cohort and 54 months (range 4-105) in the validation cohort. In both cohorts, high perivascular FAI values around the proximal right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery (but not around the left circumflex artery) were predictive of all-cause and cardiac mortality and correlated strongly with each other. Therefore, the perivascular FAI measured around the right coronary artery was used as a representative biomarker of global coronary inflammation (for prediction of cardiac mortality, hazard ratio [HR] 2·15, 95% CI 1·33-3·48; p=0·0017 in the derivation cohort, and 2·06, 1·50-2·83; p&lt;0·0001 in the validation cohort).

Between 2008 and 2016, 2040 patients in the validation cohort had coronary CTA (median age 53 years [range 19-87]). Median follow-up was 72 months (range 51-109) in the derivation cohort and 54 months (range 4-105) in the validation cohort. In both cohorts, high perivascular FAI values around the proximal right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery (but not around the left circumflex artery) were predictive of all-cause and cardiac mortality and correlated strongly with each other. Therefore, the perivascular FAI measured around the right coronary artery was used as a representative biomarker of global coronary inflammation (for prediction of cardiac mortality, hazard ratio [HR] 2·15, 95% CI 1·33-3·48; p=0·0017 in the derivation cohort, and 2·06, 1·50-2·83; p&lt;0·0001 in the validation cohort).

<p>PURPOSE: Sarcopenia is a major problem of the elderly. Although little is known about the cause of sarcopenia, the intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC) is known to be a cause of sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of IMAC as a cause of sarcopenia.METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent aneurysm repair and were monitored preoperatively and 3 years postoperatively by computed tomography (CT). The skeletal muscle area and IMAC were measured on preoperative L3 CT images. The clinical characteristics and risk factors for skeletal muscle wasting were assessed.RESULTS: Among the 155 patients, 38 (24.5%) had<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>10% skeletal muscle wasting 3 years after the operation. Patients with &gt;<U+2009>10% skeletal muscle wasting had higher IMACs of the iliopsoas (-<U+2009>0.31<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 vs. -0.45<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) muscles and higher rates of cerebrovascular infarctions (7.7 vs. 23.7%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0068), lung cancer (0 vs. 10.5%, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), and urgent operations (0.9 vs. 10.5%, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.029) and a longer postoperative fasting period (1.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.1 vs. 3.1<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.9 days, P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) than those without &gt;<U+2009>10% skeletal muscle wasting. The IMAC of the iliopsoas muscle correlated strongly with skeletal muscle wasting (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05, r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.70).CONCLUSIONS: A high IMAC of the iliopsoas muscle may cause sarcopenia and thus be a clinical target in disease prevention.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: Osteoarthritis (OA) represents a relevant social and economic burden worldwide. “Mesenchymal stem cells” or, as recently proposed, “medicinal signaling cells” (MSCs) have been recently introduced as injective treatments for OA with the aim of restoring joint homeostasis. The aim of this review is to provide the reader with the tools necessary to interpret the currently available clinical data, focusing on the MSC mechanisms of action which might help to clarify what we should expect from this treatment.METHODS: Clinical studies reporting MSC injections for the treatment of knee OA, either freshly isolated or culture-expanded cells, have been included and commented in relation to the supposed therapeutic effect that MSCs might exert giving their supposed mode of actions.RESULTS: The majority of the studies reports significant improvements in terms of pain and knee function compared to baseline values, up to 24 months of follow-up. Although these data support the expected therapeutic effect of this therapy giving the features of these cells, only 14% of the studies present a control group and more than one-third of them report the results on less than ten patients.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the constant presence of positive and satisfactory results in the studies analyzed, the complexity of MSC metabolism and related therapeutic effects as well as the weakness of most of the studies do not allow withdrawing definitive conclusions about the superiority of one tissue source over another, as well as about the best cell dose and the long-term durability of the effects of these procedures. Given the high potential value of these therapies in the treatment of OA, further studies accurately designed, carefully defining the type of patients to be included and pursuing minimal standard requirements in terms of follow-up, number of patients, and types of measurements should be conducted to finally assess the efficacy of MSC-based injective treatments.</p>

<p>Prevalence of obesity is growing in the general population as well as among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients requiring dialysis. Obesity often leads to a situation when a mature outflow vein is located deeper than 6 mm and is difficult to cannulate. These obese patients usually require additional procedures to able to successfully cannulate the fistula. The available surgical options include: outflow vein elevation, liposuction, and lipectomy. We present a case of a 57-year-old obese female with ESRD and matured, deeply running, inadequate for cannulation arteriovenous fistula. We present a technique of lipectomy with wide resection of adipose tissue from superior and lateral surfaces of outflow vein. Postoperatively, the skin without the underlying adipose tissue collapses allowing easy cannulation of the long segment of outflow vein with two needles. Lipectomy of mature but deeply located outflow vein is a second-stage elective procedure. Wide resection of adipose tissue helps create easy to access cannulation zone in obese individuals.</p>

<p>The role of Ahnak in obesity has been reported previously. Loss of Ahnak leads to decreased Bmp4/Smad1 signaling, resulting in the downregulation of adipocyte differentiation. However, the biological significance of Ahnak remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that Ahnak-mediated impaired adipogenesis results in decreased Bmpr1a transcriptional expression. To confirm this, Ahnak siRNA was used to knock-down Ahnak in C3H10T1/2 and primary stromal vascular fraction cells. Ahnak siRNA transfected cells showed suppression of Bmpr1a expression and decreased BMP4/ Bmpr1a signaling. The differential adipogenesis was further confirmed by knock-down of Bmpr1a in C3H10T1/2 cells, which resulted in reduced adipogenesis. Moreover, stable Ahnak knock-out C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with Ahnak CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid suppressed expression of Bmpr1a and prevented differentiation into adipocytes. Furthermore, we developed immortalized pre-adipocytes from wild-type or Ahnak Knock-out mice’s stromal vascular fraction (SVF) to confirm the function of Ahnak in pre-adipocyte transition. Immortalized Ahnak knock-out SVF cells showed lower level of Bmpr1a expression, evidence by their impaired BMP4/Bmpr1a signaling. Upon adipogenic induction, immortalized Ahnak knock-out SVF cells exhibited a marked decrease in adipocyte differentiation compared with immortalized wild-type pre-adipocytes. Furthermore, over-expression of Bmpr1a restored the adipogenic activity of Ahnak knock-out C3H10T1/2 cells and immortalized Ahnak knock-out SVF cells. Our data reveal the missing link in Ahnak-mediated adipose tissue remodeling and suggest that precise regulation of Ahnak in adipose tissue might have a therapeutic advantage for metabolic disease treatment.</p>

<p>Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is implicated in the development of coronary atherosclerosis by secretion of inflammatory adipocytokines. Recent studies have shown significantly higher EAT volume in psoriatic patients compared with that in control subjects, but this has not been validated in Japanese patients. We enrolled 86 Japanese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and 31 control subjects, and evaluated EAT volume and coronary artery calcification (CAC) by retrospectively assessing non-enhanced computed tomography obtained through routine examinations. Both mean EAT volume and mean CAC score were not significantly different between the two groups. Interestingly, however, a subanalysis with those of 50 years of age or less (28 psoriatic patients and seven non-psoriatic subjects) showed significantly higher mean EAT volume in psoriatic patients. Similarly, the ratio of the presence of at least one CAC was significantly higher in this group. Our findings suggest that Japanese psoriatic patients should also be aware of the cardiovascular risk, and EAT volume and CAC may be useful tools to predict such risk.</p>

<p>Fibrous hamartoma of infancy (FHI) is a benign mesenchymal tumor of young children. It has a broad clinical differential diagnosis and is often clinically confused for vascular and malignant soft tissue neoplasms. Recognition of the unique histologic features of FHI, a triphasic population of mature adipose tissue, mature fibrous tissue, and immature mesenchymal tissue, will ensure the correct diagnosis. In this report we present a case of this rare entity, including the associated clinical, radiologic, and histologic findings.</p>

<p>Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing vessels, is essential for growth and development. Development of drugs that can accelerate or decelerate angiogenesis in the context of various diseases requires appropriate preclinical screening. As angiogenesis involves complex cellular and molecular processes, in vivo studies are superior to in vitro investigations. Conventional in vitro, in vivo, and ex ovo models of angiogenesis are time consuming and tedious, and require sophisticated infrastructure for embryo culture. In the present study, we established an in ovo chick embryo yolk sac membrane (YSM) assay for angiogenesis and tested the angiogenic potential of arginine, conditioned medium (CM) from human adipose tissue and placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs-CM and PDMSCs-CM), avastin and vitamin C. The obtained results were confirmed with the routinely employed chick embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) assay. Both assays revealed the pro-angiogenic nature of arginine, ADMSCs-CM, and PDMSCs-CM, and the anti-angiogenic effect of avastin and vitamin C. This novel in ovo YSM model is simple, reproducible, and highly economic in terms of the time frame and cost incurred. The proposed model is thus a suitable substitute to the CAM model for pilot screening of potential angiogenic and anti-angiogenic agents.</p>

<p>Laparoscopy-assisted D2 radical distal gastrectomy has been acknowledged as standard procedure for local advanced gastric cancer. But due to the abundant blood vessels and complicated anatomy of the stomach, lymphadenectomy has been considered as one of the difficulties of the operation, especially in the supra-pancreatic area. This article is to share the experiences of this topic from Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University with the following five aspects. (1) How to dissect No.11p lymph nodes thoroughly and whether the exposure of splenic vein is needed? (2) Is it necessary to reveal portal vein during the lymphadenectomy of supra-pylorus and supra-pancreatic areas?(3) During laparoscopic operation, where is the posterior boundary of No.9 lymph nodes at the right side of celiac artery?(4) How to make it easier, safer, and more complete for supra-pancreatic lymphadenectomy? (5) How to deal with the tandem enlarged lymph nodes at the right side of celiac artery? According to the authors’ experiences of laparoscopic radical gastrectomy, the following points may be helpful to make the supra-pancreatic lymphadenectomy safe, complete, and standard: (1) Transection of vessels of duodenum, right stomach and left stomach in advance will make the lymphadenectomy at the right side of the celiac artery easier. (2) The exposure of splenic vein as far as possible is necessary during the dissection of No.11p lymph nodes, and it is necessary to dissect the lymph-adipose tissue at the posterior-superior border of splenic artery and pancreas in front of Gerota fascia. (3) The left side of portal vein must be revealed initiatively for dissection of No.12a lymph nodes. (4) The lymph-adipose tissue must be dissected at the included angle of common hepatic artery and celiac artery and the right wall of the celiac artery should be revealed during the dissection of No.8a and the right side of No.9 lymph nodes. (5) The exposure of portal vein and the transection of left gastric vein at the root will make the dissection of this area safer and complete. (6) En bloc D2 plus operation will be a better option, when comfronted with tandem enlarged lymph nodes at the right side of celiac artery.</p>

<p>AIMS: Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) is a powerful lymphangiogenic factor. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a promising therapeutic modality for several diseases because ADSCs secret growth factors and exosomes, which modulate hostile microenvironments affected by diseases. However, the effect of exosomes on VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis and its mechanism remain unclear.METHODS: ADSCs were cultured in media with or without recombinant VEGF-C and exosomes were extracted from conditioned medium (CM). Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were treated with ADSCs-derived exosomes, then proliferation, migration and tube formation of LECs were assayed using cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell chamber inserts and matrigel-based tube formation assay respectively.RESULTS: We identified significantly higher levels of miR-132 in exosomes isolated from VEGF-C-treated ADSCs (ADSCs/VEGF-C) than in those from ADSCs control. miR-132 was directly transferred from ADSCs to the LECs by the mediation of exosomes. The exosomes from ADSCs/VEGF-C promoted LECs proliferation, migration, and tube formation more potently than the exosomes from ADSCs, whereas pretreatment of ADSCs with miR-132 inhibitor attenuates VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenic response. Finally we reveal that miR-132 promotes lymphangiogenic response by directly targeting Smad-7 and regulating TGF-ß/Smad signaling.CONCLUSION: These data provide new insights into the role of ADSCs-derived exosomes as an important player in VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis.</p>

<p>Human subcutaneous adipose tissue has been recognized as a rich source of tissue resident mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) in recent years. The current study was designed to sort the minipig (mp) perivascular stem cells (PSCs) and investigate the osteogenic potential. Purification of human PSCs was achieved via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from human liposuction samples [cluster of differentiation (CD)45-CD34-CD146+ perithelial cells and CD45-CD34+CD146- adventitial cells]. Subsequently, PSCs were isolated from mp adipose tissue samples (n=9), characterized and, using purified mpPSCs (obtained by FACS, which is used in human PSC purification), the mpPSC osteogenic and adipogenic potential was evaluated by Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O staining in vitro, respectively. The cell morphometry was observed following cell isolation and culture, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to identify the fat tissue structure and vascular distribution. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation-associated gene expression levels were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that the same antigens used for human PSC identification and isolation were working in mp tissue (CD45, CD146 and CD34). The two cell groups: CD45-CD34-CD146+ pericytes and CD45-CD34+CD146- adventitial cells were successfully isolated from the subcutaneous fat in the posterior neck of mps, mpPSCs accounted for 8.6% of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) with 1.4% pericytes and 7.2% adventitial cells. mpPSCs demonstrated characteristics of MSCs, including cell surface marker expression, colony forming unit-fibroblast inclusion, and the stronger osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential than that of the non-selected vascular stromal cells. The mRNA expression levels of osteocalcin, collagen, type I, a1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> in the mpPSCs group were significantly higher than those of the unsorted pSVF group (P&lt;0.05). Thus, the current study successfully isolated and cultured CD146+ and CD34+ cell populations from mp tissues, characterized the cells’ PSC-like phenotype and identified their distinctly osteogenic and adipogenic potential.</p>

<p>Pericardial adipose tissue, which comprises both epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and paracardial adipose tissue (PAT), has recently been recognized as a novel factor in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary artery disease (CAD). The goal of this study was to evaluate differences in the brown-like characteristic and proteome among human EAT, PAT, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to identify candidate molecules causing CAD. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and other brown-related proteins were highly expressed in pericardial adipose tissue but was weakly expressed in SAT from the same non-CAD patient. Moreover, pericardial adipose tissues displayed a higher thermogenesis than SAT. However, brown-related genes were lower in CAD pericardial fat. Remarkably, there were lower levels of metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid metabolism in pericardial adipose tissues of CAD. EAT is an organ adjacent to aortic root without anatomy barriers, which differs from PAT. We found that the expression of ribosomal protein S3A (RPS3A) was decreased in human EAT as well as in mouse perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Knockdown of RPS3A significantly inhibited adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes and impaired the function of mitochondria in mature adipocytes. Moreover, RPS3A knockdown in mouse periaortic adipose tissue impaired browning of PVAT, accelerated vascular inflammation, and atherosclerosis progression. Mechanistically, RPS3A can migrate to the mitochondria to maintain the function of brown adipocytes. These findings provide compelling evidence that RPS3A was a key factor for modulating the brown fat-specific gene UCP-1 and carbon metabolic enzymes in EAT for preventing CAD.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) stimulates functional blood vessel formation in obese fat pads, which in turn facilitates healthy expansion of the adipose tissue. However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of ß3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and energy expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the ß3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Collectively, these results demonstrate that transient overexpressed VEGF-A activates the sympathetic nervous system, which hence promotes lipolysis and browning in adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Ever since their discovery in 2001, adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) have profoundly modified clinical indications and our practice of plastic surgery, thereby placing our discipline at the forefront of regenerative medicine. These cells act through paracrine signaling by synthesizing immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic factors. They are of key importance with regard to the regenerative properties of autologously grafted adipose tissue (AT). Taken together, they make up the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) comprising all AT cells except for adipocytes. As our knowledge evolves, we are moving from fat grafting towards SVF grafting, of which the essential sought-after effect is tissue regeneration. The objective of the present review is to synthesize present-day information on ASCs and their immunomodulatory properties and, from a practical standpoint, to indicate present-day and future steps towards establishment of clinical routine, particularly through application of techniques favoring mechanical digestion of adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is a common benign tumor in the urinary system, mainly composed of adipose tissue, blood vessels and muscle tissue. Renal AML is sporadic in most of patients, while a few are associated with tuberous sclerosis. Classical renal AML occurs predominantly in middle-aged females. Most cases are found incidentally during imaging examinations. The fat content makes AML have unique imaging characteristics and is easy to be identified with other renal tumors. However, the amount of fat varies in each tumor. AML that contains only microscopically detectable fat and whose amount of intratumoral fat may be too small to be identified on unenhanced computed tomography (CT) images is termed minimal fat or fat-poor renal AML, which appears as a high density shadow in the renal parenchyma on unenhanced CT images. Thus, it can be difficult to distinguish it from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) on imaging. Since the imaging findings are atypical, the diagnosis depends on pathological results. In addition, a few of AML can mimic malignant neoplasms. Recent studies suggested that AML might involve to peri-renal or renal sinus fat, regional lymphatics and other visceral organs, as well as inferior vena cava, which further makes the diagnosis more difficult. However, there is currently no reports about involvement of regional limphatics in minimal fat renal AML. In this article, we report a 27-year-old female patient without family history of tuberous sclerosis, who came to visit the hematologist because a high density shadow near the left kidney was found during CT scan which was accompanied by neck, armpits, groin, abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal lymph nodes enlargement. She was suspected of lymphoma in the beginning and transferred to Department of Urology to perform laparoscopic left renal mass and retroperitoneal lymph node excision and pathological examination for a definitive diagnosis. Finally, pathologic results revealed AML. Postoperative continuous lymphatic fistula developed and the retroperitoneal drainage of chylous fluid was 100-200 mL per day, lasting for 12 weeks. The fistula was successfully closed after conservative treatment including fasting and rehydration. This article summaries and discusses the diagnosis and treatment of renal AML with lymph nodes enlargement and the management of postoperative refractory lymphatic fistula by reviewing the related cases and literature.</p>

<p>Obesity is a major risk factor that contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) expression is increased in the adipose tissue of obese patients and several studies provide evidence that MR pharmacological antagonism improves glucose metabolism in genetic and diet-induced mouse models of obesity. In order to investigate whether the lack of adipocyte MR is sufficient to explain these beneficial metabolic effects, we generated a mouse model with inducible adipocyte-specific deletion of Nr3c2 gene encoding MR (adipo-MRKO). We observed a significant, yet not complete, reduction of Nr3c2 transcript and MR protein expression in subcutaneous and visceral adipose depots of adipo-MRKO mice. Notably, only mature adipocyte fraction lacks MR, whereas the stromal vascular fraction maintains normal MR expression in our mouse model. Adipo-MRKO mice fed a 45% high fat diet for 14 weeks did not show any significant difference in body weight and fat mass compared to control littermates. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed that mature adipocyte MR deficiency did not improve insulin sensitivity in response to a metabolic homeostatic challenge. Accordingly, no significant changes were observed in gene expression profile of adipogenic and inflammatory markers in adipose tissue of adipo-MRKO mice. Moreover, pharmacological MR antagonism in mature primary murine adipocytes, which differentiated ex vivo from wild-type mice, did not display any effect on adipokine expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the depletion of MR in mature adipocytes displays a minor role in diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) promote nerve regeneration. Biodegradable nerve conduits are used to treat peripheral nerve injuries, but their efficiencies are lower than those of autologous nerve grafts. This study developed biodegradable nerve conduits containing ADSCs and SVF and evaluated their facial nerve regenerating abilities in a rat model with a 7-mm nerve defect. SVF and ADSCs were individually poured into nerve conduits with polyglycolic acid-type I collagen as a scaffold (ADSCs and SVF groups). The conduits were grafted on to the nerve defects. As the control, the defect was bridged with polyglycolic acid-collagen nerve conduits without cells. At 13 weeks, after transplantation, the regenerated nerves were evaluated physiologically and histologically. The compound muscle action potential of the SVF group was significantly higher in amplitude than that of the control group. Electron microscopy showed that the axon diameter of the SVF group was the largest, followed by the ADSC group and control group with significant differences among them. The SVF group had the largest fiber diameter, followed by the ADSC group and control group with significant differences among them. The ADSC group had the highest myelin thickness, followed by the SVF group and control group with significant differences among them. Identical excellent promoting effects on nerve regeneration were observed in both the ADSC and SVF groups. Using SVF in conduits was more practical than using ADSCs because only the enzymatic process was required to prepare SVF, indicating that SVF could be more suitable to induce nerve regeneration.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is currently seen as a paracrine organ that produces vasoactive substances, including inflammatory agents, which may have an impact on the vasculature. In this study PVAT density was quantified in patients with an aortic aneurysm and compared with those with a non-dilated aorta. Since chronic inflammation, as the pathway to medial thinning, is a hallmark of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), it was hypothesised that PVAT density is higher in AAA patients.METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective case control study, three groups of patients were included: non-treated asymptomatic AAA (n = 140), aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) (n = 104), and individuals without aortic pathology (n = 97). A Hounsfield units based analysis was performed by computed tomography (CT). As a proxy for PVAT, the density of adipose tissue 10 mm circumferential to the infrarenal aorta was analysed in each consecutive CT slice. Intra-individual PVAT differences were reported as the difference in PVAT density between the region of the maximum AAA diameter (or the mid-aortic region in patients with AIOD or controls) and the two uppermost slices of infrarenal non-dilated aorta just below the renal arteries. Furthermore, subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue measurements were performed. Linear models were fitted to assess the association between the study groups, different adipose tissue compartments, and between adipose tissue compartments and aortic dimensions.RESULTS: AAA patients presented higher intra-individual PVAT differences, with higher PVAT density around the aneurysm sac than the healthy neck. This association persisted after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and diseases and other fat compartments (ß = 13.175, SE 4.732, p = .006). Furthermore, intra-individual PVAT differences presented the highest correlation with aortic volume that persisted after adjustment for other fat compartments, body mass index, sex, and age (ß = 0.566, 0.200, p = .005).CONCLUSION: The results suggest a relation between the deposition of PVAT and AAA pathophysiology. Further research should explore the exact underlying processes.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Primary angiosarcoma of the kidney is a rare and aggressive malignant tumor presenting with a recognizable vascular differentiation. Its prognosis is fatal and the pathogenesis remains unclear. Renal angiomyolipoma is a relatively infrequent renal cortical neoplasm and is composed of variable proportions of adipose tissue, spindle cells, epithelioid smooth muscle cells and abnormal thick-walled blood vessels.CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we reported a case in which a 64-year-old woman presenting with the chief complaint of a progressively enlarged mass in the left abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed presence of a tumor measuring 18 cm<U+2009>×<U+2009>11 cm in the left posterior renal fascia. Microscopic examination and immunohistochemical staining confirmed co-existence of angiomyolipoma and angiosarcoma. Furthermore, the two components interspersed with each other and there were transitional zones between them.CONCLUSIONS: In this case, we described for the first time a primary renal angiosarcoma possibly arising in a pre-existing angiomyolipoma of the kidney.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological efficacy of autologous adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) versus hyaluronic acid in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthritis.METHODS: Sixteen patients with bilateral symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (K-L grade II to III; initial pain evaluated at four or greater on a ten-point VAS score) were enrolled in this study, which were randomized into two groups. Each patient received 4-ml autologous adipose-derived SVF treatment (group test, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>16) in one side of knee joints and a single dose of 4-ml hyaluronic acid treatment (group control, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>16) in the other side. The clinical evaluations were performed pre-operatively and post-operatively at one month, three months, six months, and 12-months follow-up visit, using the ten-point visual analog scale (VAS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the knee range of motion (ROM). The whole-organ assessment of the knees was performed with whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) based on MRI at baseline, six months and 12-months follow-up. The articular repair tissue was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively by magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score based on follow-up MRI at six months and 12 months.RESULTS: No significant baseline differences were found between two groups. Safety was confirmed with no severe adverse events observed during 12-months follow-up. The SVF-treated knees showed significantly improvement in the mean VAS, WOMAC scores, and ROM at 12-months follow-up visit compared with the baseline. In contrast, the mean VAS, WOMAC scores, and ROM of the control group became even worse but not significant from baseline to the last follow-up visit. WORMS and MOCART measurements revealed a significant improvement of articular cartilage repair in SVF-treated knees compared with hyaluronic acid-treated knees.CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that autologous adipose-derived SVF treatment is safe and can effectively relief pain, improve function, and repair cartilage defects in patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p>

<p>There is little understanding about dietary proteins and their potential contribution to obesity-induced inflammation. This study investigates the effect of 10 weeks of aerobic training and whey protein (WP) supplementation on visceral adipose tissue inflammation in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). In the first phase, which lasted 9 weeks, 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) normal diet (n = 8), and (2) HFD (n = 32). In the second phase, rats fed an HFD were randomly assigned into 4 groups (n = 8/group): (1) sedentary, (2) WP, (3) aerobic training, and (4) WP + aerobic training. The aerobic training was performed for 10 weeks, 5 days/week at 21 m/min, 15% incline, for 60 min/day. HFD significantly increased body weight, adiposity index, fat pads weight, glucose levels, and insulin resistance index compared with the normal diet. Also, levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in adipose tissue and serum levels of TNF-a were increased in the HFD group. Glucose levels, insulin resistance index, and triglycerides were reduced only by WP, independently of aerobic training. Both the aerobic training and WP reduced the fat pads weight and levels of TNF-a, HIF-1a, and VEGF-A in adipose tissue. Nevertheless, the levels of MCP-1 in adipose tissue and serum levels of TNF-a and MCP-1 were not reduced significantly by WP or aerobic training. These findings suggest that both aerobic training and WP supplementation lead to a reduction in adiposity and ameliorate obesity-induced inflammation in visceral adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Regenerative medicine seeks to stall or to reverse the pathologic consequences of chronic diseases. Many people with diabetes have peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which increases their already high risk of major amputation. Cellular therapies are a promising regenerative medicine approach to PAD that can be used to focally inject regenerative cells to endangered tissue beds. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to promote tissue regeneration through stromal support and paracrine stimulation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Whereas little is known about human diabetic MSCs (dMSCs), particularly those from patients with PAD, dMSCs have a limited expansion capacity but can be improved with human platelet lysate (PL) supplementation. PL is rich in many growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is known to be important to cell proliferation and survival signaling pathways. We hypothesize that dMSCs have a reversible defect in EGF receptor pathways. The objective of this work was to test this hypothesis using dMSCs from PAD patients.</AbstractText>: Regenerative medicine seeks to stall or to reverse the pathologic consequences of chronic diseases.

EGF supplementation led to similar AKT expression as with PL, but PL had greater phosphorylation of AKT at 30 and 60 minutes. The conditioned media from both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had robust levels of prominent angiogens (vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, hepatocyte growth factor), which stimulated EC proliferation and migration, and the co-culture of dMSCs with ECs led to significantly longer EC sprouts in three-dimensional gel than EC-alone pellets.</AbstractText>: Both BM- and ATD-dMSCs had typical MSC surface marker expression and similar expansion profiles, and they did not express EGF in their secretome.

<p>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have several similar risk factors but different pathogenesis. Inflammation of the arteries is common to both. Central obesity can act as an endocrine organ through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and the perivascular fat has a local effect that could contribute to diseases of the abdominal aorta. Although the relation between central obesity and atherosclerosis occlusive arterial disease has been demonstrated, the correlation with AAA has conflicting results. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between central obesity and the presence of abdominal aortic diseases using computed tomography.METHODS: Six hundred thirty-nine consecutive patients classified into 3 groups (AAA, aortic atherosclerotic occlusive disease (AAOD), and without aortic disease [control group]) who underwent computed tomography had the aorta diameter, the visceral fat area (VFA), and the subcutaneous fat area (SFA) measured at the level of third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.RESULTS: VFA showed no difference between the groups. SFA was lower in atherosclerotic group (AAOD) than control (P &lt; 0.01 in general and P &lt; 0.04 in male). In AAA group, we found in men that the first tertile of aorta diameter had higher VFA than third tertile (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in VFA between patients in AAA, AAOD, and without aortic disease groups. In men with aneurysm, there was an inverse relationship between VFA and aortic diameter. In AAOD, visceral to subcutaneous ratio is higher due to lower SFA.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue plays a central role in energy homeostasis and thermoregulation. It is composed of different types of adipocytes, as well as adipocyte precursors, immune cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and nerve projections. Although the molecular control of cell type specification and how these cells interact have been increasingly delineated, a more comprehensive understanding of these adipose-resident cells can be achieved by visualizing their distribution and architecture throughout the whole tissue. Existing immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence approaches to analyze adipose histology rely on thin paraffin-embedded sections. However, thin sections capture only a small portion of tissue; as a result, the conclusions can be biased by what portion of tissue is analyzed. We have therefore developed an adipose tissue clearing technique, Adipo-Clear, to permit comprehensive three-dimensional visualization of molecular and cellular patterns in whole adipose tissues. Adipo-Clear was adapted from iDISCO/iDISCO+, with specific modifications made to completely remove the lipid stored in the tissue while preserving native tissue morphology. In combination with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate here the use of the Adipo-Clear method to obtain high-resolution volumetric images of an entire adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Obesity is a low-grade inflammatory disease that increases the risk for metabolic disorders. CD40-CD40L signaling plays a central role in obesity-induced inflammation. Genetic deficiency of CD40L in diet-induced obesity (DIO) ameliorates adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis and increases insulin sensitivity. Unexpectedly, absence of CD40 worsened insulin resistance and caused excessive adipose tissue inflammation and hepatosteatosis. To investigate whether deficiency of macrophage CD40 is responsible for the phenotype observed in the CD40-/- mice, we generated CD40flflLysMcre and fed them a standard (SFD) and 54% high fat obesogenic diet (HFD) for 13 weeks. No differences in body weight, adipose tissue weight, adipocyte size, plasma cholesterol or triglyceride levels could be observed between CD40flflLysMcre and wild type (WT) mice. CD40flflLysMcre displayed no changes in glucose tolerance or insulin resistance, but had higher plasma adiponectin levels when fed a SFD. Liver weights, liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as the degree of hepatosteatosis were not affected by absence of macrophage CD40. CD40flflLysMcre mice displayed a minor increase in adipose tissue leukocyte infiltration on SFD and HFD, which did not result in differences in adipose tissue cytokine levels. We here show that loss of macrophage CD40 signaling does not affect obesity induced metabolic dysregulation and indicates that CD40-deficiency on other cell-types than the macrophage is responsible for the metabolic dysregulation, adipose tissue inflammation and hepatosteatosis that are observed in CD40-/- mice.</p>

<p>Blood vessels composed of endothelial cells (ECs) contact with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in different tissues, suggesting possible interaction between these 2 types of cells. We hypothesized that endothelin-1 (ET1), a secreted paracrine factor of ECs, can differentially direct the lineages of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). Predifferentiated ASCs and BMSCs were treated with ET1 for 2 cell passages and then induced for multilineage differentiation. Our results showed that adipogenesis of ET1-pretreated ASCs and osteogenesis of ET1-pretreated BMSCs were increased compared to those of control cells. The effect of ET1 on enhancing adipogenesis of ASCs and osteogenesis of BMSCs was attenuated by blocking endothelin receptor type A (ETAR) and/or endothelin receptor type B (ETBR). Western blot analysis indicated that regulation by ET1 was mediated through activation of the protein kinase B and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. We analyzed subpopulations of ASCs and BMSCs with or without ETAR and/or ETBR, and we found that ETAR<sup>+</sup>/ETBR<sup>-</sup> and ETAR<sup>-</sup>/ETBR<sup>+</sup> subpopulations of ASCs and those of BMSCs pretreated with ET1 were prone to turning into adipocytes and osteoblasts, respectively, after differentiation induction. Our findings provide insight into the differential regulation of MSC specification by ET1, which may help develop viable approaches for tissue regeneration.-Lee, M.-S., Wang, J., Yuan, H., Jiao, H., Tsai, T.-L., Squire, M.

<p>Stem cell therapy is considered as the most promising treatment for chronic wounds. Extracellular matrix/stromal vascular fraction gel (ECM/SVF gel), an adipose-derived stem cell-based cytotherapy, has shown healing potential in experimental wounds in animal models. However, the effects of ECM/SVF gel on human chronic wounds have not been investigated. The aim of the present study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of ECM/SVF gel on human chronic wounds.Autologous ECM/SVF gel was prepared and used to treat patients with chronic wounds in clinics, with negative pressure wound therapy as the positive control. Wound healing rate per week and histological changes were performed.The average wound healing rate per week in the ECM/SVF gel group was 34.55<U+200A>±<U+200A>11.18% compared with 10.16<U+200A>±<U+200A>2.67% in the negative pressure wound therapy group (P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>.001). Histological analysis with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome staining, and CD31 immunohistochemistry showed less lymphocyte infiltration, more collagen accumulation, and more newly formed vessels in the ECM/SVF gel group treated skins compared to the control.ECM/SVF gel is an effective therapeutic option for chronic wound healing in clinics.</p>

<p>The hallmarks of systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmunity, microangiopathy and fibrosis. Skin fibrosis is accompanied by attrition of the dermal white adipose tissue layer, and alterations in the levels and function of adiponectin. Since these findings potentially implicate adiponectin in the pathogenesis of SSc, we employed a novel pharmacological approach to augment adiponectin signaling using AdipoRon, an orally active adiponectin receptor agonist. Chronic treatment with AdipoRon significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis in mice. AdipoRon attenuated fibroblast activation, adipocyte-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation, Th2/Th17-skewed polarization of the immune response, vascular injury and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition within the lesional skin. In vitro, AdipoRon abrogated profibrotic responses elicited by TGF-ß in normal fibroblasts, and reversed the inherently-activated profibrotic phenotype of SSc fibroblasts. In view of these broadly beneficial effects on all three cardinal pathomechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of SSc, pharmacological augmentation of adiponectin signaling might represent a novel strategy for the treatment of SSc.</p>

<p>Adipocyte progenitors reside in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissues that are composed of fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells. It remains to be elucidated how the SVF regulates adipocyte progenitor fate determination and adipose homeostasis. Here, we report that fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1)+ fibroblasts in the SVF are essential to adipose homeostasis. FSP1+ fibroblasts, devoid of adipogenic potential, are adjacent to the preadipocytes in the SVF. Ablation of FSP1+ fibroblasts in mice severely diminishes fat content of adipose depots. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling in the FSP1+ fibroblasts results in gradual loss of adipose tissues and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Alterations in the FSP1+ fibroblasts reduce platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB signaling and result in the loss of preadipocytes. Reduced PDGF-BB signaling, meanwhile, impairs the adipogenic differentiation capability of preadipocytes by regulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling. Thus, FSP1+ fibroblasts are an important niche essential to the maintenance of the preadipocyte pool and its adipogenic potential in adipose homeostasis.</p>

<p>The effective transportation of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic wastes through new blood vessel networks is key to the survival of engineered constructs in large bone defects. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), which are regarded as excellent candidates for both bone and blood vessel engineering, are the preferred option for the restoration of massive bone defects. Therefore, we propose to induce ADSCs into osteogenic and endothelial cells differently. A modified hierarchical mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) scaffold with an enhanced compressive strength was constructed and prevascularized by seeding with endothelial-induced ADSCs (EI-ADSCs). The prevascularized scaffolds were combined with osteogenically induced ADSCs (OI-ADSCs) to repair critical-size bone defects. To validate the angiogenesis of the prevascularized MBG scaffolds in vivo, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used to label EI-ADSCs. The labeled EI-ADSCs were demonstrated to survive and participate in vascularization at day 7 after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice by double immunofluorescence staining of CD31 and GFP. Regarding the restoration of critical size bone defects, early angiogenesis of rat femur plug defects was evaluated by perfusion of Microfil after 3 weeks. Compared to nonvascularized MBG carrying OI-ADSCs (MBG/OI-ADSCs) and non-cell-seeded MBG scaffolds, the prevascularized MBG carrying OI-ADSCs (Pv-MBG/OI-ADSCs) showed enhanced angiogenesis on the surface and interior. Through dynamic bone formation analysis with sequential fluorescent labeling and Van Gieson’s picro-fuchsin staining, we found that the Pv-MBG/OI-ADSCs exhibited the highest mineral deposition rate after surgery, which may be contributed by rapid vascular anastomosis facilitating increased survival of the seeded OI-ADSCs and by the recruitment function for bone mesenchymal stem cells. Therefore, the strategy of time-phase sequential utilization of ADSCs on MBG scaffolds is a practical design for the repair of massive bone defects.</p>

<p>Obesity is accompanied by an extensive remodeling of adipose tissue primarily via adipocyte hypertrophy. Extreme adipocyte growth results in a poor response to insulin, local hypoxia, and inflammation. By stimulating the differentiation of functional white adipocytes from progenitors, radical hypertrophy of the adipocyte population can be prevented and, consequently, the metabolic health of adipose tissue can be improved along with a reduction of inflammation. Also, by stimulating a differentiation of beige/brown adipocytes, the total body energy expenditure can be increased, resulting in weight loss. This approach could prevent the development of obesity co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This paper describes the isolation, expansion, and differentiation of white and beige adipocytes from a subset of human adipose tissue endothelial cells that co-express the CD31 and CD34 markers. The method is relatively cheap and is not labor-intensive. It requires access to human adipose tissue and the subcutaneous depot is suitable for sampling. For this protocol, fresh adipose tissue samples from morbidly obese subjects [body mass index (BMI) &gt;35] are collected during bariatric surgery procedures. Using a sequential immunoseparation from the stromal vascular fraction, enough cells are produced from as little as 2-3 g of fat. These cells can be expanded in culture over 10-14 days, can be cryopreserved, and retain their adipogenic properties with passaging up to passage 5-6. The cells are treated for 14 days with an adipogenic cocktail using a combination of human insulin and the PPAR<U+03B3> agonist-rosiglitazone. This methodology can be used for obtaining proof of concept experiments on molecular mechanisms that drive adipogenic responses in adipose endothelial cells, or for screening new drugs that can enhance the adipogenic response directed either towards white or beige/brown adipocyte differentiation. Using small subcutaneous biopsies, this methodology can be used to screen out non-responder subjects for clinical trials aimed to stimulate beige/brown and white adipocytes for the treatment of obesity and co-morbidities.</p>

<p>Adiponectin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue, is very abundant in plasma, and its anti- and pro-inflammatory effects are reported. However, the mechanisms of these pro- and anti-inflammatory effects are not fully defined. Herein, we evaluated the dual inflammatory response mechanism of adiponectin in macrophages. Short-term globular adiponectin (gAd) treatment induced I<U+03BA>Ba degradation, NF-<U+03BA>B nuclear translocation, and TNF-a production in RAW 264.7 cells. Polymyxin B pretreatment did not block gAd-induced I<U+03BA>Ba degradation, and heated gAd was unable to degrade I<U+03BA>Ba, suggesting that the effects of gAd were not due to endotoxin contamination. gAd activated IKK and Akt, and inhibition of either IKK or Akt by dominant-negative IKKß (DN-IKKß) or DN-Akt overexpression blocked gAd-induced I<U+03BA>Ba degradation, suggesting that short-term incubation with gAd mediates inflammatory responses by activating the I<U+03BA>B/NF-<U+03BA>B and PI3K/Akt pathways. Contrastingly, long-term stimulation with gAd induced, upon subsequent stimulation, tolerance to gAd, lipopolysaccharide, and CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide, which is associated with gAd-induced downregulation of IL-receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) due to IRAK-1 transcriptional repression. Conclusively, our findings demonstrate that the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to gAd in innate immune cells are time-dependent, and mediated by the activation of the I<U+03BA>B/NF-<U+03BA>B pathway, and IRAK-1 downregulation, respectively.</p>

<p>It has previously been reported that human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) can promote the regeneration of damaged tissues in rats with liver failure through a ‘paracrine effect’. Here we demonstrate a therapeutic effect of hASCs derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) on rat models with acute liver failure, as shown by the improvement of the survival rate by &gt;70% compared to controls. Gene sequencing of rat liver revealed an increase in human long-chain non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 after hASC-derived EVs transplantation. When the H19 coding sequence was silenced in hASCs and EVs were then collected for treatment of rats with liver failure, we saw a decrease in the survival rate to 40%, compared to treatment with EVs generated from non-silenced hASCs. These data indicate that lncRNA H19 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of liver failure.</p>

<p>It is debated whether sex differences in adiponectin and leptin are due to sex differences in body fat distribution. In this cross-sectional analysis of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, associations of measures of body fat and sex with serum adiponectin and leptin concentrations were examined using linear regression analysis (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6494, VAT: n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2516). Sex differences were additionally adjusted for the measure of body fat that was most strongly associated with adiponectin or leptin concentrations. Median adiponectin concentrations in women and men were 10.5<U+2009>mg/L (IQR, interquartile range: 7.7-13.9) and 6.1<U+2009>mg/L (IQR: 4.5-8.2), mean difference 4.6<U+2009>mg/L (95% CI: 4.3, 4.9). Median leptin concentrations in women and men were 19.2<U+2009>µg/L (IQR: 11.5-30.0) and 7.1<U+2009>µg/L (IQR: 4.6-11.1), mean difference 15.1<U+2009>µg/L (95% CI: 14.4, 15.8). VAT was most strongly associated with adiponectin, total body fat percentage was most strongly associated with leptin. After adjustment for VAT, women had 3.8<U+2009>mg/L (95% CI: 3.3, 4.3) higher adiponectin than men. After adjustment for total body fat percentage, leptin concentrations in women were 0.4<U+2009>µg/L lower than in men (95% CI: -1.2, 2.0). One genetic variant (rs4731420) was associated with extreme leptin concentrations (&gt;100<U+2009>µg/L) in women: odds ratio 2.8 (95% CI: 1.7, 4.6). Total body fat percentage was strongly associated with leptin concentrations. Higher leptin concentrations in women than in men were completely explained by differences in total body fat percentage. Visceral fat was associated with adiponectin concentrations, and did not completely explain higher adiponectin concentrations in women than in men.</p>

<p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive complication, closely related to endothelial dysfunction. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) have the capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells for vascular repair. Therefore, we hypothesized that induced endothelial differentiation of ADSCs might hold great potential for the treatment of PE. In this study, the primary ADSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated by the collagenase digestion method. The supernatant of HUVECs was collected from the first generation of cells. Then, ADSCs were divided into two groups: ADSCs alone group and induced ADSCs (iADSCs) group. In iADSCs group, ADSCs were induced by HUVECs conditioned medium and ADSCs special culture medium at a ratio of 1:1 over a two-week period. In order to identify the endothelial characteristics of iADSCs, CD31 and CD34 were examined by flow cytometry. The proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis assays were employed to compare the bioactivity of iADSCs and ADSCs. Furthermore, The levels of angiogenic related factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placenta growth factor (P1GF) were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Results showed conditioned medium from HUVECs promoted ADSCs proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. In addition, the levels of VEGF and P1GF were significantly enhanced in iADSCs group. This study uncovered the iADSCs application potential in the therapy and intervention of PE.</p>

<p>Here we present our progress in inducing an ectopic brown adipose tissue (BAT) phenotype in skeletal muscle (SKM) as a potential gene therapy for obesity and its comorbidities. We used ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD), a novel targeted, non-viral approach to gene therapy, to deliver genes in the BAT differentiation pathway into rodent SKM to engineer a thermogenic BAT phenotype with ectopic mUCP-1 overexpression. In parallel, we performed a second protocol using wild-type Ucp-1-null knockout mice to test whether the effects of the gene therapy are UCP-1 dependent. Our main findings were a robust cellular presence of mUCP-1 immunostaining (IHC), significantly higher expression levels of mUCP-1 measured by qRT-PCR, and highest temperature elevation measured by infrared thermography in the treated thigh, achieved in rats after delivering the UTMD-PRDM16/PGC-1a/BMP7/hyPB gene cocktail. Interestingly, the weight loss obtained in the treated rats with the triple gene delivery, never recovered the levels observed in the controls in spite of food intake recovery. Our results establish the feasibility of minimally invasive UTMD gene-based therapy administration in SKM, to induce overexpression of ectopic mUCP-1 after delivery of the thermogenic BAT gene program, and describe systemic effects of this intervention on food intake, weight loss, and thermogenesis.</p>

<p>Intestinal alkaline phosphatase 3 (AKP3) is an enzyme that was reported to play a role in lipid metabolism and to prevent high fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome in mice. To investigate a potential functional role of AKP3 in diet-induced adiposity and metabolic health, we have kept male and female wild-type or AKP3 deficient mice on a high fat diet for 15 weeks to induce obesity and compared those with mice kept on standard fat diet. Body weight as well as adipose tissue mass were statistically significantly higher upon high fat diet feeding for mice of both genders and genotypes. Female mice of either genotype kept on high fat diet gained less weight, resulting in smaller adipose tissue depots with smaller adipocytes. However, AKP3 deficiency had no significant effect on body weight gain or adipose tissue mass and did not affect adipocyte size or density. Gene expression analysis revealed no effect of the genotype on inflammatory parameters in adipose tissue, except for tumor necrosis factor alpha, which was higher in mesenteric adipose tissue of female obese mice. Plasma glucose and insulin levels were also not affected in obese AKP3 deficient mice. Overall, our data do not support a functional role of AKP3 in adipose tissue development, or insulin sensitivity.</p>

<p>The heightened risk of heart failure in type 2 diabetes cannot be explained by the occurrence of clinically overt myocardial ischemic events or hyperglycemia. Experimentally, insulin exerts detrimental effects on the heart, vasculature, kidneys, and adipose tissue that can lead to heart failure. In both randomized clinical trials and observational studies, antihyperglycemic drugs that act through insulin signaling (i.e., sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and incretins) increase the risk or worsen the clinical course of heart failure, whereas drugs that ameliorate hyperinsulinemia and do not signal through insulin (i.e., metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) reduce the risk of heart failure.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in transplantation therapy due to their multilineage differentiation potential, abundance, and immuno-modulating ability. However, the risk of allograft rejection limits their application. Here, we proposed a novel method to facilitate MSC transplantation with enhanced applicability and efficacy. We cultured human adipose-derived MSCs in a 3D culture under in vitro expansion conditions and under conventional 2D adherent culture conditions. MSC spheroids promoted extracellular matrix molecules that stimulate MSC proliferation, and produced more angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor than 2D-cultured MSCs. Further, MSC spheroids showed increased IDO expression, increased proportion of M2 macrophages, and decreased macrophage proliferation, compared to 2D-cultured MSCs. Next, we proposed the wrapping of autologous cell sheets from the recipient around in-vitro-grown MSC spheroids to prevent allogenic immune rejection during transplantation. Myoblasts from C57BL/6 mice were used to prepare a stem cell composite sheet containing human-derived MSC spheres. The transplantation of MSC spheroids increased the survival rate and decreased the inflammatory response of the immunocompetent C57BL/6 ischemic mice. Thus, combining 3D-cultured MSC spheroid technology with immune evasion stem cell composite sheet improved the outcome and strengthened the protection against allogenic immune rejection.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) seems to be a promising regenerative therapeutic agent due to the minimally invasive approach of their harvest and multi-lineage differentiation potential. The harvested adipose tissues are further digested to extract stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is cultured, and the anchorage-dependent cells are isolated in order to characterize their stemness, surface markers, and multi-differentiation potential. The differentiation potential of ASCs is directed through manipulating culture medium composition with an introduction of growth factors to obtain the desired cell type. ASCs have been widely studied for its regenerative therapeutic solution to neurologic, skin, wound, muscle, bone, and other disorders. These therapeutic outcomes of ASCs are achieved possibly via autocrine and paracrine effects of their secretome comprising of cytokines, extracellular proteins and RNAs. Therefore, secretome-derivatives might offer huge advantages over cells through their synthesis and storage for long-term use. When considering the therapeutic significance and future prospects of ASCs, this review summarizes the recent developments made in harvesting, isolation, and characterization. Furthermore, this article also provides a deeper insight into secretome of ASCs mediating regenerative efficacy.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Tissue-engineered vascular grafts containing adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells offer an alternative to small-diameter vascular grafts currently used in cardiac and lower-extremity revascularization procedures. Adipose-derived, mesenchymal stem cell-infused, tissue-engineered vascular grafts have been shown to promote remodeling and vascular homeostasis in vivo and offer a possible treatment solution for those with cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, the time needed to cultivate adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells remains a large hurdle for tissue-engineered vascular grafts as a treatment option. The purpose of this study was to determine if stromal vascular fraction (known to contain progenitor cells) seeded tissue-engineered vascular grafts would remain patent in vivo and remodel, allowing for a “same-day” process for tissue-engineered vascular graft fabrication and implantation.METHODS: Stromal vascular fraction, obtained from adult human adipose tissue, was seeded within 4 hours after acquisition from the patient onto poly(ester urethane)urea bilayered scaffolds using a customized rotational vacuum seeding device. Constructs were then surgically implanted as abdominal aortic interposition grafts in Lewis rats.RESULTS: Findings revealed patency in 5 of 7 implanted scaffolds at 8 weeks, along with neotissue formation and remodeling occurring in patent tissue-engineered vascular grafts. Patency was documented using angiography and gross inspection, and remodeling and vascular components were detected using immunofluorescent chemistry.CONCLUSIONS: A “same-day” cell-seeded, tissue-engineered vascular graft can remain patent after implantation in vivo, with neotissue formation and remodeling occurring by 8 weeks.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Diseases of the cardiovascular system are the most common cause of death in patients after kidney transplantation (KTx). Pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement is a simple, noninvasive, and increasingly popular method to assess arterial stiffness, and thus to assess cardiovascular risk. The aim of the study was to compare arterial stiffness and body composition in patients after KTx in the early and late postoperative periods.METHODS: This research was carried out from January to November 2017 at two locations: (1) Department and Clinic of General and Transplant Surgery and (2) Nephrology and Transplantology Clinic Medical University of Warsaw, the Infant Jesus Teaching Hospital, Warsaw, Poland. The study group consisted of 30 patients in the early postoperative period (2-7 postoperative days) and 151 patients in the late period (6 months to 27 years) after KTx. A single blood pressure measurement, PWV, was performed using a Schiller BR-102 plus PWV. Body composition analysis was performed using a Tanita MC-780 device.RESULTS: The average PWV for patients in the early period after KTx was 8.02 ± 2.21 m/s and in the late period 8.09 ± 1.68 m/s. Positive correlations were found between adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity (R = 0.444, P = .033) and PWV value. There was no correlation between the values of PWV and time after transplantation (R = 0.034, P = .777). Upon analyzing patients after transplantation and taking into account the type of dialysis therapy, lower systolic blood pressure (142 ± 21 mm Hg vs 156 ± 24 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (84 ± 13 mm Hg vs 98 ± 11 mm Hg) values were observed in patients treated with hemodialysis compared with those treated with peritoneal dialysis.CONCLUSION: Using PWV measurement, we found that arterial stiffness levels were similar for early and late periods after transplantation.</p>

<p>Introduction We evaluated the relationship between adipokine plasma concentrations and body fat distribution and the metabolic syndrome. Methods In a cohort of 1215 patients with clinically manifest vascular disease the relation between subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, waist circumference, body mass index and plasma concentrations of adipsin, chemerin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, migration inhibitory factor, nerve growth factor, resistin, plasma amyloid A1, adiponectin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and hepatic growth factor were cross-sectionally assessed with linear regression and adjusted for age and gender. The relation between adipokines and the metabolic syndrome was cross-sectionally evaluated using logistic regression. An adipokine profile was developed to measure the effect of combined rather than single adipokines. Results Adiposity was related to higher nerve growth factor, hepatic growth factor, migration inhibitory factor, leptin and adipsin and with lower chemerin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, resistin, plasma amyloid A1 and adiponectin. The strongest positive relations were between body mass index and adipsin (ß 0.247; 95% CI 0.137-0.356) and leptin (ß 0.266; 95% CI 0.207-0.324); the strongest negative relations were between body mass index and plasma amyloid A1 (ß -0.266; 95% CI -0.386 to -0.146) and visceral adipose tissue and adiponectin (ß -0.168; 95% CI -0.226 to -0.111). There was no relation between subcutaneous adipose tissue and adipokines. Odds for the metabolic syndrome were higher with each 1 SD higher hepatic growth factor (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.06-1.38) and leptin (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.10-1.45) and lower with each 1 SD higher adiponectin (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.64-0.83) and resistin (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74-0.97). The adipokine profile was related to the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.00-1.06). Conclusion Plasma concentrations of adipokines are related to obesity and body fat distribution. The relation between adipokine concentrations and the metabolic syndrome is independent of visceral adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) or SERPINA12 according to the serpin nomenclature was identified together with other genes and gene products that were specifically expressed or overexpressed in the intra-abdominal or visceral adipose tissue (AT) of the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rat. These rats spontaneously develop visceral obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and -glycemia, as well as hypertension and thus represent a well suited animal model of obesity and related metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.The follow-up study reporting the cloning, expression and functional characterization of vaspin suggested the great and promising potential of this molecule to counteract obesity induced insulin resistance and inflammation and has since initiated over 300 publications, clinical and experimental, that have contributed to uncover the multifaceted functions and molecular mechanisms of vaspin action not only in the adipose, but in many different cells, tissues and organs. This review will give an update on mechanistic and structural aspects of vaspin with a focus on its serpin function, the physiology and regulation of vaspin expression, and will summarize the latest on vaspin function in various tissues such as the different adipose tissue depots as well as the vasculature, skin, bone and the brain.</p>

<p>Adipose stem cells (ASCs) have gained attention in the fields of stem cells regenerative medicine due to their multifaceted therapeutic capabilities. Promising preclinical evidence of ASCs has supported the substantial interest in the use of these cells as therapy for human disease. ASCs are an adult stem cell resident in adipose tissue with the potential to differentiation along mesenchymal lineages. They also are known to be recruited to sites of inflammation where they exhibit strong immunomodulatory capabilities to promote wound healing and regeneration. ASCs can be isolated from adipose tissue at a relatively high yield compared to their mesenchymal cell counterparts: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Like BM-MSCs, ASCs are easily culture expanded and have a reduced immunogenicity or are perhaps immune privileged, making them attractive options for cellular therapy. Additionally, the heterogeneous cellular product obtained after digestion of adipose tissue, called the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), contains ASCs and several populations of stromal and immune cells. Both the SVF and culture expanded ASCs have the potential to be therapeutic in various diseases. This review will focus on the preclinical and clinical evidence of SVF and ASCs, which make them potential candidates for therapy in regenerative medicine and inflammatory disease processes.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has the capacity to secrete vasoactive mediators with the potential to regulate vascular function. Given its location adjacent to the vasculature, PVAT dysfunction may be part of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. To study the mechanisms of PVAT dysfunction, several adipogenic models have been proposed. However, these approaches do not adequately reflect PVAT adipocyte phenotypes variability that depends on their anatomical location. Despite PVAT importance in modulating vascular function, to date, there is not a depot-specific adipogenic model for PVAT adipocytes. We present a model that uses coculturing of PVAT stromal vascular fraction derived preadipocytes with primary adipocytes isolated from the same PVAT. Preadipocytes were isolated from thoracic aorta PVAT and mesenteric resistance artery PVAT (mPVAT). Upon confluency, cells were induced to differentiate for 7 and 14 days using a standard protocol (SP) or standard protocol cocultured with primary adipocytes isolated from the same adipose depots (SPA) for 96, 120, and 144 h. SPA reduced the time for differentiation of stromal vascular fraction derived preadipocytes and increased their capacity to store lipids compared with SP as indicated by lipid accumulation, lipolytic responses, gene marker profile expression, and adiponectin secretion. The coculture system improved adipogenesis efficiency by enhancing lipid accumulation and reducing the time of induction, therefore, is a more efficient method compared to SP alone.</p>

<p>Development of therapeutic agents directed towards increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) energy expenditure to combat obesity and its comorbidities is currently an area of intense research. Both preclinical and clinical studies have suggested a potentially significant role for BAT in regulating whole body energy expenditure as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. Lipids, particularly long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), are recognized as integral substrates in mediating the primary heat-producing functions of BAT, and to date thought to be principally sourced from stored intracellular lipid droplets. While this prior understanding is not disputed, recent evidence has demonstrated the importance of lipids derived from the circulation, including those from dietary sources and from tissue lipolysis, especially white adipose tissue lipolysis. Moreover, recent studies have shed further light on a potential role for BAT as an autocrine, paracrine and endocrine organ, with lipids as key signaling molecules. Advances in metabolomics have enabled high-resolution exploration of biomolecules that may be associated with various physiological processes and potentially pathological states. Such approaches have led to several novel lipid species recently being associated with BAT function and dysfunction. Further exploration of the circulating lipidome will likely reveal additional novel BAT biomarkers that can inform development of BAT-directed therapies. This review will address current progress and new strategies to identify and characterize BAT-associated lipids which may represent both novel activators and/or activity biomarkers with both research and clinical utility.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the form of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and cultured expansion have been applied in clinical settings in some countries to treat osteoarthritis (OA) of knees, one of the most common debilitating, incurable disorders. Since the first report of successful cartilage-like tissue regeneration with autologous adipose SVF containing ASCs, there has been a gradual increase in the number of publications confirming such results. Thus far, most of the reports have been limited to treatments of OA of knees. Recently, successful applications of adipose SVF in treating OA of ankles and hips have been reported. In addition, several groups have reported modified methods of applying adipose SVF, such as combining bone marrow stimulation with adipose SVF or adding additional extracellular matrix (ECM) in treating OA. Here, we present an updated, systematic review of clinical effectiveness and safety in treating OA of knees, ankles, and one hip since 2016 using ASCs in the form of adipose SVF or in cultured expansion, along with a description and suggestion of potential biological mechanisms of cartilage regeneration.</p>

<p>We have shown that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), specifically 11,12- and 14,15-EETs, reduce adipogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cells and mouse preadipocytes (3T-3L1). In this study, we explore the effects of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) deletion on various aspects of adipocyte-function, including programing for white vs. beige-like fat, and mitochondrial and thermogenic gene-expressions. We further hypothesize that EETs and heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) form a synergistic, functional module whose effects on adipocyte and vascular function is greater than the effects of sEH deletion alone. In in vitro studies, we examined the effect of sEH inhibitors on MSC-derived adipocytes. MSC-derived adipocytes exposed to AUDA, an inhibitor of sEH, exhibit an increased number of small and healthy adipocytes, an effect reproduced by siRNA for sEH. in vivo studies indicate that sEH deletion results in a significant decrease in adipocyte size, inflammatory adipokines NOV, TNFa, while increasing adiponectin (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). These findings are associated with a decrease in body weight (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), and visceral fat (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Importantly, sEH deletion was associated with a significant increase in Mfn1, COX 1, UCP1 and adiponectin (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.03). sEH deletion was manifested by a significant increase in EETs isomers 5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET and an increased EETs/DHETEs ratio. Notably, activation of HO-1 gene expression further increased the levels of EETs, suggesting that the antioxidant HO-1 system protects EETs from degradation by ROS. These results are novel in that sEH deletion, while increasing EET levels, resulted in reprograming of white fat to express mitochondrial and thermogenic genes, a phenotype characteristic of beige-fat. Thus, EETs agonist(s) and sEH inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of metabolic syndrome and obesity.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are the most common benign renal tumours. Most of these neoplasms are found incidentally on imaging. However, symptomatic presentation does exist. Renal AMLs are typically composed of smooth muscle, blood vessels, and adipose tissue. Because of the abundant fat tissue, they give a characteristic appearance on imaging and are therefore easily diagnosed. However, sometimes they contain too little fat to be detected. This increases the difficulty in differentiating them from renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Management of AML is based on clinical presentation and should be individualized for every patient. Treatment modalities range from active surveillance to more invasive approaches.</p>

<p>Insufficient vascularization is a major cause for the development of non-unions. To overcome this problem, adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments (MVF) may serve as vascularization units. However, their application into bone defects needs a carrier system. Herein, we analyzed whether this is achieved by a thermoresponsive hydrogel (TRH). MVF were isolated from CD-1 mice and cultivated after incorporation into TRH, while non-incorporated MVF served as controls. Viability of MVF was assessed immunohistochemically over a 7-day period. Moreover, osteotomies were induced in femurs of CD-1 mice. The osteotomy gaps were filled with MVF-loaded TRH (TRH<U+202F>+<U+202F>MVF), unloaded TRH (TRH) or no material (control). Bone healing was evaluated 14 and 35<U+202F>days postoperatively. MVF incorporated into TRH exhibited less apoptotic cells and showed a stable vessel morphology compared to controls. Micro-computed tomography revealed a reduced bone volume in TRH<U+202F>+<U+202F>MVF femurs. Histomorphometry showed less bone and more fibrous tissue after 35<U+202F>days in TRH<U+202F>+<U+202F>MVF femurs compared to controls. Accordingly, TRH<U+202F>+<U+202F>MVF femurs exhibited a lower osseous bridging score and a reduced bending stiffness. Histology and Western blot analysis revealed an increased vascularization and CD31 expression, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was reduced in TRH<U+202F>+<U+202F>MVF femurs. Furthermore, the callus of TRH<U+202F>+<U+202F>MVF femurs showed increased receptor activator of NF-<U+03BA>B ligand expression and higher numbers of osteoclasts. These findings indicate that TRH is an appropriate carrier system for MVF. Application of TRH<U+202F>+<U+202F>MVF increases the vascularization of bone defects. However, this impairs bone healing, most likely due to lower VEGF expression during the early course of bone healing.In the present study we analyzed for the first time the in vivo performance of a thermoresponsive hydrogel (TRH) as a delivery system for bioactive microvascular fragments (MVF). We found that TRH represents an appropriate carrier for MVF as vascularization units and maintains their viability. Application of MVF-loaded TRH impaired bone formation in an established murine model of bone healing, although vascularization was improved. This unexpected outcome was most likely due to a reduced VEGF expression in the early phase bone healing.</AbstractText>: In the present study we analyzed for the first time the in vivo performance of a thermoresponsive hydrogel (TRH) as a delivery system for bioactive microvascular fragments (MVF).

<p>BACKGROUND: Lipomas are very common benign neoplasms, which constitute 99% of all adipose-derived tumors. Main treatment option includes surgical excision, which is unacceptable for a number of patients seeking ways to improve esthetic appearance of their skin. Therefore, alternative treatment options are being sought.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of lipoma removal using a Class III CE-marked device (Aqualyx™) administered as a high-frequency ultrasound-guided injection (intralipotherapy).METHODS: A total of 17 lipomas were treated. The procedure involved a high-frequency ultrasound-guided injection. A maximum of 3 injections per a lipoma were performed. High-frequency ultrasound was used for assessing the size of lipomas and monitoring treatment-induced changes to the lipomas and adjacent tissue.RESULTS: Response to treatment was achieved in all cases. A complete removal was achieved in 70.59% of lipomas. The remaining 29.41% of lipomas were not completely removed, yet significantly reduced in size.CONCLUSION: An injection of Aqualyx™, a CE-marked drug, is a good noninvasive treatment of lipomas. Ultrasound guided procedure is recommended, as it ensures appropriate technique and enables monitoring treatment-induced changes. Considering a low number of published reports of such treatment, it is crucial to continue this research.</p>

<p>Although the divergent male and female differentiation depends on key genes, many biological differences seen in men and women are driven by relative differences in estrogen and testosterone levels. Gender dysphoria denotes the distress that gender incongruence with the assigned sex at birth may cause. Gender-affirming treatment includes medical intervention such as inhibition of endogenous sex hormones and subsequent replacement with cross-sex hormones. The aim of this study is to investigate consequences of an altered sex hormone profile on different tissues and metabolic risk factors. By studying subjects undergoing gender-affirming medical intervention with sex hormones, we have the unique opportunity to distinguish between genetic and hormonal effects.</AbstractText>: Although the divergent male and female differentiation depends on key genes, many biological differences seen in men and women are driven by relative differences in estrogen and testosterone levels.

<p>BACKGROUND: In obese patients with end stage renal disease, puncturing matured arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) that run deep under the skin surface may prove difficult. To achieve reliable puncturability, there are several surgical solutions. Superficialization with mobilization is common. With some newer options (lipectomy and liposuction) subcutaneous adipose tissue is surgically reduced. There are only a few authors who have published their experience with liposuction and we want to add our own results.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our experience with ultrasound-guided liposuction (USGL). We introduce liposuction cannulas via small incisions to reduce the subcutaneous adipose tissue overlying the planned cannulation zones under ultrasound control using tumescent anaesthesia till the prospective needle access segments become easily palpable. So far, we have used this technique for cephalic forearm and upper arm fistulas only. Furthermore, we review the relevant literature.CONCLUSIONS: USGL is a method that can be learned easily, is minimally invasive, seems to be safe, and requires only short operation times.</p>

Furthermore, the expression of mitoNEET, a mitochondrial membrane protein related to energy expenditure, was significantly increased by pioglitazone treatment, while reduced in the hypertrophic PVAT induced by high-fat diet.

<p>Autologous fat grafting is an emerging therapeutic option for cutaneous wounds. The regenerative potential of autologous fat relates to the presence of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). ADSCs are capable of differentiating into fibroblasts and keratinocytes, as well as secreting soluble mediators with angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the wound healing literature in humans. This systematic review aims to critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous fat grafting in acute and chronic cutaneous wounds with an appraisal of the quality of evidence available.</AbstractText>: Autologous fat grafting is an emerging therapeutic option for cutaneous wounds.

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro osteogenic capacity of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) overexpressing adipose-derived (Ad-) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) sheets (BMP-7-CS). In addition, BMP-7-CS were transplanted into critical-sized bone defects and osteogenesis was assessed. BMP-7 gene expressing lentivirus particles were transduced into Ad-MSCs. BMP-7, at the mRNA and protein level, was up-regulated in BMP-7-MSCs compared to expression in Ad-MSCs. Osteogenic and vascular-related gene expressions were up-regulated in BMP-7-CS compared to Ad-MSCs and Ad-MSC sheets. In a segmental bone-defect model, newly formed bone and neovascularization were enhanced with BMP-7-CS, or with a combination of BMP-7-CS and demineralized bone matrix (DBM), compared to those in control groups. These results demonstrate that lentiviral-mediated gene transfer of BMP-7 into Ad-MSCs allows for stable BMP-7 production. BMP-7-CS displayed higher osteogenic capacity than Ad-MSCs and Ad-MSC sheets. In addition, BMP-7-CS combined with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) stimulated new bone and blood vessel formation in a canine critical-sized bone defect. The BMP-7-CS not only provides BMP-7 producing MSCs but also produce osteogenic and vascular trophic factors. Thus, BMP-7-CS and DBM have therapeutic potential for the treatment of critical-sized bone defects and could be used to further enhance clinical outcomes during bone-defect treatment.</p>

<p>A double-cell sheet (DCS) complex composed of an osteogenic cell sheet and a vascular endothelial cell sheet with osteogenesis and blood vessel formation potential was developed in this study. The osteogenic and vascular endothelial cell sheets were obtained after induced culture of rabbit adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The osteogenic cell sheet showed positive alizarin red, von Kossa, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining. The vascular endothelial cell sheet exhibited visible W-P bodies in the cells, the expression of CD31 was positive, and a vascular mesh structure was spontaneously formed in a Matrigel matrix. The subcutaneous transplantation results for four groups of DCS and DCS-coral hydroxyapatite (CHA) complexes, and the CHA scaffold group in nude mice revealed mineralization of collagen fibers and vascularization in each group at 12<U+202F>weeks, but the degrees of mineralization and vascularization showed differences among groups. The pattern involving endothelial cell sheets covered with osteogenic cell sheets, group B, exhibited the best results. In addition, the degree of mineralization of the DCS-CHA complexes was more mature than those of the same group of DCS complexes and the CHA scaffold, and the capillary number was greater than those of the same group of DCS complexes and the CHA scaffold. Therefore, the CHA scaffold strengthened the osteogenesis and blood vessel formation potential of the DCS complexes. Meanwhile, the DCS complexes also promoted the osteogenesis and blood vessel formation potential of the CHA scaffold. This study will provide a basis for building vascularized tissue-engineered bone for bone defect therapy.This study developed a double-cell sheet (DCS) complex composed of an osteogenic cell sheet and a vascular endothelial cell sheet with osteogenesis and blood vessel formation potential.

<p>Adipose tissue, initially known only for storing excess fat, produces a number of active cytokine-like hormones, collectively known as adipokines or adipocytokines. These molecules are further known to elicit auto-, para- and endocrine functions in the body. In healthy bodies, the cardiovascular endothelium maintains vascular health by critically controlling the interplay between various factors. However, in diseased states such as obesity, owing to numerous metabolic malfunctions, this vascular homeostasis is disrupted. The dysregulated metabolic stimuli perturb vascular homeostasis via initiating or exacerbating the pre-existing inflammatory processes. These inflammatory processes further recruit immune cells to the site of injury, alter cell adhesion molecule expression, and reduce Nitric Oxide levels. These altered mechanisms result in increased blood pressure, endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. In this review article, we aim to evaluate the current literature in understanding the role of Chemerin in vascular health and furthermore, its role in maintaining vascular homeostasis with respect to inflammation, obesity and associated Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) risk factors. For over fifteen years, a growing body of research has been published studying Chemerin in the disease states associated with obesity, MetS and cardiovascular disease. Chemerin appears to form an integral link between obesity and related dysfunctional cardiometabolic states as well as in inflammation and immune-system related complications. These combine to suggest a significant Chemerin role in human vascular health and disease.</p>

<p>Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may serve as novel endocrine mediators of adipose tissue and impact upon vascular health. However, it is unclear whether adipocyte-derived EVs are present in the human circulation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to seek evidence for the presence of adipocyte-derived EVs in circulating plasma. Size-exclusion chromatography of platelet-free plasma identified fractions 5 to 10 as containing EVs by a peak in particle concentration, which corresponded with the presence of EV and adipocyte proteins. Pooling fractions 5 to 10 and subjecting to ultracentrifugation yielded a plasma EV sample, as verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showing EV structures and Western blotting for EV (e.g., CD9 and Alix) and adipocyte markers. Magnetic beads and a solid-phase assay were used to deplete the EV sample of the four major families of circulating EVs: platelet-derived, leukocyte-derived, endothelial-derived, and erythrocyte-derived EVs. Postdepletion samples from both techniques contained EV structures as visualized by TEM, as well as CD9, Alix, and classic adipocyte proteins. Postdepletion samples also contained a range of other adipocyte proteins from an adipokine array. Adipocyte proteins and adipokines are expressed in optimally processed plasma EV samples, suggesting that adipocyte-derived EVs are secreted into the human circulation.</p>

<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are distinct and dynamic organelles that affect the health of cells and organs. Much progress has been made in understanding how these structures are formed, how they interact with other cellular organelles, how they are used for storage of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue, and how they regulate lipolysis. Our understanding of the biology of LDs in the heart and vascular tissue is relatively primitive in comparison with LDs in adipose tissue and liver. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a working group to discuss how LDs affect cardiovascular diseases. The goal of the working group was to examine the current state of knowledge on the cell biology of LDs, including current methods to study them in cells and organs and reflect on how LDs influence the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. This review summarizes the working group discussion and recommendations on research areas ripe for future investigation that will likely improve our understanding of atherosclerosis and heart function.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue possesses phenotypic gene expression characteristics that are similar to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Nevertheless, the multilineage potential may be inhibited, and cells may not expand adequately to satisfy the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). An autologous hMSC-enriched fat product would fulfil the void from a biomedical and clinical perspective. In this study, we suggest a novel mechanism using a closed system without enzymes, additives or other modifications, which will produce non-expanded, accessible material. This decentralized fat product, unlike unprocessed lipoaspirates, adequately encloses the vascular stroma with adipocytes and stromal stalks along with their vascular channels and lumina. This fat product contained hASCs and fewer hematopoietic elements such as lipoaspirates, which were digested enzymatically according to flow cytometric investigations, and molecular analysis also showed significant hASC uniformity within the cells of the stromal vascular tissue. Moreover, the fat product produced a higher quantity of hASCs similar to hMSCs in isolation with the typical characteristics of an osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineage. Interestingly, these properties were evident in the non-enzymatic derived adipose tissue, as opposed to hASCs in isolation from the enzymatically digested lipoaspirates, suggesting that the aforementioned procedure may be an adequate alternative to regenerate and engineer tissue for the treatment of various medical conditions and promote efficient patient recovery.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: For a long time, our major understanding of the spleen is to function as a blood filter for the removal of aged erythrocytes and circulating microorganisms. Splenectomy, therefore, has been widely performed in case of trauma and a variety of hematologic disorders. Although some studies have indicated an increased rate of developing hyperlipidemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in splenectomized patients, our recognition of the splenic regulation on lipid metabolism and atherogenesis is still lacking. Here we explored this issue in Apoe deficient (Apoe-/-) mice fed on an atherogenic diet containing 0.5% cholesterol and 20% fat.METHODS: 7-week-old male Apoe-/- mice were randomly divided into splenectomy group and sham operation group. After 1-week recovery from the surgery, mice were subjected to the atherogenic diet for the next 8 weeks.RESULTS: The atherogenic diet induced a severe hypercholesterolemia (about 1500 mg/dl), steatohepatitis and accelerated atherogenesis in the Apoe-/- mice. Splenectomy, compared to sham operation, did not alter plasma lipid levels or lipoprotein profiles; it also did not alter hepatic or adipose lipid deposition. Meanwhile, splenectomy did not alter atherosclerotic plaque burden or composition; it also did not alter aortic gene expression associated with macrophage inflammatory responses.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that splenectomy had no significant impacts on lipid metabolism and atherogenesis in Apoe-/- mice fed on a severe atherogenic diet.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), a special type of adipose tissue, closely surrounds vascular adventitia and produces numerous bioactive substances to maintain vascular homeostasis. PVAT dysfunction has a crucial role in regulating vascular remodeling, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how obesity-induced PVAT dysfunction affected adventitia remodeling in early vascular injury stages. Mini pigs were fed a high sugar and fat diet for 6 months to induce metabolic syndrome and obesity. In the mini pigs, left carotid vascular injury was then generated using balloon dilation. Compared with normal mini pigs, obese mini pigs displayed significantly enhanced vascular injury-induced adventitial responses, evidenced by adventitia fibroblast (AF) proliferation and differentiation, and adventitia fibrosis, as well as exacerbated PVAT dysfunction characterized by increased accumulation of resident macrophages, particularly the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, increased expression of leptin and decreased expression of adiponectin, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-18. Primary AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium from obese mini pigs also showed significantly increased proliferation and differentiation. We further revealed that activated nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and its downstream products, i.e., IL-1 family members such as IL-1ß and IL-18 were upregulated in the PVAT of obese mini pigs; PVAT dysfunction was also demonstrated in preadipocytes treated with palmitic acid. Finally, we showed that pretreatment with IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonist or IL-1R knockdown blocked AF proliferation and differentiation in AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium. These results demonstrate that obesity-induced PVAT dysfunction aggravates adventitial remodeling after early vascular injury with elevated AF proliferation and differentiation via activating the NLRP3/IL-1 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent disorder, representing the single most common endocrine-metabolic disorder in reproductive-aged women. Currently there are four recognized phenotypes of PCOS: 1) hyperandrogenism+oligo-anovulation+polycystic ovarian morphology; 2) hyperandrogenism+oligo-anovulation; 3) hyperandrogenism+polycystic ovarian morphology; and 4) oligo-anovulation+polycystic ovarian morphology, each with different long-term health and metabolic implications. Clinicians should clearly denote a patient’s phenotype when making the diagnosis of PCOS. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a highly inherited complex polygenic, multifactorial disorder. Pathophysiologically abnormalities in gonadotropin secretion or action, ovarian folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, insulin secretion or action, and adipose tissue function, among others, have been described in PCOS. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus; hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome; hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular thrombosis, cerebrovascular accidents, and possibly cardiovascular events; subfertility and obstetric complications; endometrial atypia or carcinoma, and possibly ovarian malignancy; and mood and psychosexual disorders. The evaluation of patients suspected of having PCOS includes a thorough history and physical examination, assessment for the presence of hirsutism, ovarian ultrasonography, and hormonal testing to confirm hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation as needed and to exclude similar or mimicking disorders. Therapeutic decisions in PCOS depend on the patients’ phenotype, concerns, and goals, and should focus on 1) suppressing and counteracting androgen secretion and action, 2) improving metabolic status, and 3) improving fertility. However, despite significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of the disorder over the past 20 years, the disorder remains underdiagnosed and misunderstood by many practitioners.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The perineal body connects muscles from the pelvic floor and is critical for support of the lower part of the vagina and proper function of the anal canal. We determined mechanical parameters and volume fractions of main components of the human female postmenopausal perineal body.METHODS: The specimens were taken from 15 fresh female cadavers (age 74<U+200A>±<U+200A>10, mean<U+200A>±<U+200A>standard deviation). Seventy-five specimens from five regions of the perineal body were processed histologically to assess volume fractions of tissue components using stereological point testing grid. Fifteen specimens taken from the midline region were loaded uniaxially with 6<U+200A>mm/min velocity until tissue rupture to determine Young’s modulus of elasticity, ultimate stresses, and strains.RESULTS: The perineal body was composed of collagen (29%), adipose cells (27%), elastin (7%), smooth muscle (11%), and skeletal muscle (3%). The residual tissue (19%) constituted mostly peripheral nerves, lumina of blood vessels, fibroblasts, and fibrocytes. Young’s modulus of elasticity at midline region was 18<U+200A>kPa (median) at small and 232<U+200A>kPa at large deformations, respectively. The ultimate stress was 172<U+200A>kPa and the ultimate strain was 1.4.CONCLUSIONS: We determined the structural and mechanical parameters of the perineal body. The resultant data could be used as input for models simulating pelvic floor prolapse or dysfunction.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Progress in breast cancer surgery results in a decreased frequency of mastectomy, in the early phases of cancer replaced by breast conserving therapy (lumpectomy). Increased popularity of breast reconstruction by fat or adipose stem cells (ASC)-enriched fat transfer raised uncertainty about the possible risk of increased cancer recurrence. In vitro studies suggest that locally secreted cytokines and reconstructed local blood vessels may stimulate cancer expansion or cancer de novo induction from glandular tissue remaining after lumpectomy.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients related to the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) augmentation during autologous fat grafting for breast reconstruction.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The tumor recurrence ratio in 56 patients having the breast reconstructed with autologous ASC (transplanted as the subpopulation present in SVF) was compared with the frequency of tumor recurrence in 252 matched patients treated in clinics without subsequent breast reconstruction. Adipose tissue was collected by the Coleman technique and split into 2 portions: one was used for breast reconstruction, the other was enzymatically digested, and isolated cells were used for the augmentation of fat implanted into the breast area. Cancer recurrence in the experimental and matched control group was evaluated following 3-year-long observation time, and the statistical significance of difference in cancer recurrence between the experimental and control group was evaluated.RESULTS: Cancer recurrence in the group of patients treated with ASC-enriched fat for breast reconstruction was 3.7% and did not differ significantly from the control group data (4.13%). No adverse effects of therapy were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not produce any data suggesting increased cancer risk following breast reconstruction after a mastectomy or a lumpectomy combined with local radiotherapy. It may be concluded that an autologous transplantation of fat augmented with ASC is a safe and efficient procedure. Longer observation time and the observation of larger numbers of patients would be useful for strengthening the conclusion.</p>

<p>The coculture of osteogenic and angiogenic cells and the resulting paracrine signaling via soluble factors are supposed to be crucial for successfully engineering vascularized bone tissue equivalents. In this study, a coculture system combining primary human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) within two types of hydrogels based on methacryloyl-modified gelatin (GM) as three-dimensional scaffolds was examined for its support of tissue specific cell functions. HDMECs, together with hASCs as supporting cells, were encapsulated in soft GM gels and were indirectly cocultured with hASCs encapsulated in stiffer GM hydrogels additionally containing methacrylate-modified hyaluronic acid and hydroxyapatite particles. After 14 days, the hASC in the stiffer gels (constituting the “bone gels”) expressed matrix proteins like collagen type I and fibronectin, as well as bone-specific proteins osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase. After 14 days of coculture with HDMEC-laden hydrogels, the viscoelastic properties of the bone gels were significantly higher compared with the gels in monoculture. Within the soft vascularization gels, the formed capillary-like networks were significantly longer after 14 days of coculture than the structures in the control gels. In addition, the stability as well as the complexity of the vascular networks was significantly increased by coculture. We discussed and concluded that osteogenic and angiogenic signals from the culture media as well as from cocultured cell types, and tissue-specific hydrogel composition all contribute to stimulate the interplay between osteogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro and are a basis for engineering vascularized bone.</p>

Although focusing on graft survival seems an obvious direction for improving clinical results, the authors’ research suggests that long-term volume retention is in part attributable to new fat regeneration. Measures to facilitate adipogenesis may therefore be equally important.To investigate the relative roles of survival and regeneration of fat grafts, the authors measured the fate of human lipoaspirate implanted into the scalps of immunodeficient mice, with and without stromal vascular fraction and a porcine extracellular matrix (Adipogel).

Specifically, the authors were interested in volume retention, and the composition of implanted or regenerated tissue at 6 and 12 weeks.Free fat grafts exhibited poor volume retention and survival. Almost all of the injected human adipocytes died, but new mouse fat formed peripheral to the encapsulated fat graft. Adipogel and stromal vascular fraction improved proliferation of murine fat and human vasculature.

Adipogel and stromal vascular fraction improved proliferation of murine fat and human vasculature. Human CD34 stromal cells were present but only in the periphery, and there was no evidence that these cells differentiated into adipocytes.In the authors’ model, most of the implanted tissue died, but unresorbed dead fat accounted substantially for the long-term, reduced volume.

<p>Adipose tissue contains multipotent cells known as adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs), which have therapeutic potential for various diseases. Although the demand for adipose tissue for research use remains high, no adipose tissue bank exists. In this study, we attempted to isolate ASCs from cryopreserved adipose tissue with the aim of developing a banking system. ASCs were isolated from fresh and cryopreserved adipose tissue of rats and compared for proliferation (doubling time), differentiation capability (adipocytes), and cytokine (hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor) secretion. Finally, ASCs (2.5 × 106) were intravenously infused into rats with spinal cord injury, after which hindlimb motor function was evaluated. Isolation and culture of ASCs from cryopreserved adipose tissue were possible, and their characteristics were not significantly different from those of fresh tissue. Transplantation of ASCs derived from cryopreserved tissue significantly promoted restoration of hindlimb movement function in injured model rats. These results indicate that cryopreservation of adipose tissue may be an option for clinical application.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND Neuroendocrine tumors found in skin or soft tissues usually represent metastasis from other organs and are considered late manifestations of disease. Therefore, primary cutaneous and soft tissue neuroendocrine tumors are extremely rare. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 48-year-old male with a neuroendocrine tumor occurring in the subcutaneous abdominal fat, which had an echographic appearance of a vascular malformation. The finding was diagnosed as compatible with neuroendocrine tumor based on histopathological and immunohistochemical studies. No other sites of possible internal origin were detected on supplementary investigations. CONCLUSIONS Soft tissue neuroendocrine tumors may have an appearance on imaging studies that challenge physicians to make a correct diagnosis. Despite the rarity of these tumors, they should be included in the differential diagnosis of other soft tissue masses.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Stem cell therapy using stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a promising treatment modality. SVF is comprised of a mixture of adipose-derived stem cells, endothelial precursor cells, and immune modulatory cells that act synergistically to facilitate angiogenesis and epithelial cell differentiation. This makes SVF an attractive option for men’s sexual disorders that require reconstitution of vasculature and endothelial lining, namely erectile dysfunction (ED) and Peyronie’s disease (PD).AIM: The objective of this study was to compare and contrast the available literature regarding the use of SVF in the treatment of male sexual dysfunction.METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed with the keywords “stromal vascular fraction” and/or “erectile dysfunction” and/or “Peyronie’s disease” and/or “sexual dysfunction.”MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure for preclinical studies was erectile function, as measured by changes in intracavernous pressures, and results of histopathologic analysis of corporal tissue. Clinical endpoint analysis in humans included various patient questionnaires.RESULTS: For ED, there were 5 preclinical studies included in the analysis, with 1 Phase 1 clinical trial in humans. Major limitations of both the preclinical and clinical studies included the absence of SVF component analysis, and short duration of follow-up. Despite a paucity of preclinical studies, there was a single clinical study assessing the efficacy of combination SVF and shock wave therapy in the treatment of PD. Limitations of this study included an absence of a control group and the use of subjective data.CONCLUSION: Preclinical and clinical data in the use of SVF for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction is deficient. Even though multiple medicinal disciplines are studying the use of SVF on a myriad of pathologies, further investigative work elucidating the mechanism and potential adverse effects of SVF need to be performed before clinical trials are undertaken.

<p>A number of studies have reported that application of autologous adipose-derived cell populations leads to improved outcome in different preclinical models of thermal burn injury. However, these studies were limited to assessment of relatively small injuries amounting to only ~2% of total body surface area (TBSA) in which the complications associated with large burns (e.g.: systemic inflammation and the need for fluid resuscitation) are absent. In anticipation of translating this approach to a clinical trial in which these complications would be present we applied a preclinical model that more closely resembles a patient with large thermal burn injury requiring skin grafting. Thus, the present study used a porcine model to investigate safety and efficacy of intravenous delivery of ADRCs in the treatment of a complex burn injury comprising ~20% TBSA and including both moderately deep (44%) partial and full thickness burns, and the injury associated with skin graft harvest.</AbstractText>: A number of studies have reported that application of autologous adipose-derived cell populations leads to improved outcome in different preclinical models of thermal burn injury.

Safety was assessed by monitoring systemic parameters (blood gases, hematology, and clinical chemistry) throughout the course of the study.

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) influences vascular function and pathology. We present a protocol using micro-computed tomography (microCT), a novel imaging technique typically used for hard biological tissue, to characterize the temporal and spatial development of aorta PVAT and luminal plaque soft tissue. Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) and C57Bl/6J (control) mice were fed a high fat western diet up to 30 weeks. 3D microCT reconstructions were used to quantify: 1) vascular wall volume, a surrogate measure of remodeling, was greater in ApoE, 2) aorta PVAT volume was reduced in ApoE, 3) plaque volumes increased over time in ApoE, 4) plaque development co-localized with luminal ostia, origins of branching arteries, which traveled through areas of greatest PVAT volume, 5) qualitatively, the same arteries showed evidence of increased tortuosity in ApoE. This study reflects the potential of microCT analyses to assess vascular wall, PVAT and arterial trajectory modifications in relevant animal models.

<p>Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes to vascular homeostasis by producing paracrine factors. Previously, we reported that selective deletion of PPAR<U+03B3> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3>) in vascular smooth muscle cells resulted in concurrent loss of PVAT and enhanced atherosclerosis in mice. To address the causal relationship between loss of PVAT and atherosclerosis, we used BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO (brown adipocyte-specific PPAR<U+03B3> knockout) mice. Approach and Results- Deletion of PPAR<U+03B3> in brown adipocytes did not affect PPAR<U+03B3> in white adipocytes or vascular smooth muscle cells or PPARa and PPARd expression in brown adipocytes. However, development of PVAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue was remarkably impaired, associated with reduced expression of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes in the BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO mice. Thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue was significantly impaired with reduced expression of thermogenesis genes in brown adipose tissue and compensatory increase in subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissues. Remarkably, basal expression of inflammatory genes and macrophage infiltration in PVAT and brown adipose tissue were significantly increased in the BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO mice. BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO mice were crossbred with ApoE KO (apolipoprotein E knockout) mice to investigate the development of atherosclerosis. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed increased systemic and PVAT inflammation. Consequently, atherosclerotic lesions were significantly increased in mice with impaired PVAT development, thus indicating that the lack of normal PVAT is sufficient to drive increased atherosclerosis. Conclusions- PPAR<U+03B3> is required for functional PVAT development. PPAR<U+03B3> deficiency in PVAT, while still expressed in vascular smooth muscle cell, enhances atherosclerosis and results in vascular and systemic inflammation, providing new insights on the specific roles of PVAT in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease at large.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: To assess the usefulness of simple axial bi-dimensional diameters of pericardial fat tissues at low-dose chest CT, in correlation with metabolic parameters in predicting metabolic syndrome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right (RPF) and left (LPF) cardiophrenic angle portions, and epicardial fats around right (REF) and left (LEF) coronary arteries, and coronary sinus (SEF) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed.RESULTS: RPF, LPF, REF, LEF, and SEF diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.74, 0.70, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.53, respectively, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) in Pearson’s correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient of RPF for AVF showed highest value. Means of each PF and EF diameters in subjects with metabolic syndrome were significantly larger than those without metabolic syndrome (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). All PF and EF diameters were well-discriminated for prediction of metabolic syndrome in ROC analysis (AUC values, from 0.696 to 0.795).CONCLUSION: RPF diameter at low-dose chest CT would be a simple method for prediction of metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>Hypertension in obesity is associated with increased insulin resistance, vascular mass and body mass index (BMI). The purpose of the study was to visualize endothelin-1 (ET-1) mediated constriction in arteries isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese hypertensive women previously operated by gastric bypass. Functional studies were conducted in a microvascular myograph. Expressed as percentage of contraction elicited by 124 mM KCl concentration-response curves for ET-1 were shifted leftward in arteries from obese hypertensive patients compared to healthy normotensive subjects. The vasodilator response to the ET-1 antagonist BQ123 (1 microM) was significantly higher in arteries from obese hypertensive patients (p&lt;0.001). BQ123 induced relaxation was inhibited by NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (0.1 nM). Preincubation with BQ123 enhanced the relaxation induced by acetylcholine (ACh; 0.1 nM - 0.1 mM) (p&lt;0.001), but not that induced by NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.1 nM - 0.1 mM), in arteries from obese hypertensive patients. The present study show that hypertension yet prevail after gastric bypass surgery and the ET(A) receptor antagonist BQ123 may be a useful tool in reducing blood pressure in obese hypertensive patients.</p>

<p>Abnormal G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) accumulation has a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Although GRK2 siRNA transfection in the liver improves insulin resistance-related vascular complications, the effects of GRK2 siRNA in lipid metabolism and obesity remain unknown. To investigate how GRK2 siRNA affects obesity, ob/ob mice were transfected with GRK2 siRNA, mainly in the liver, by using a hydrodynamic-based procedure. Epididymal fat, glucose, triglyceride, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), and alanine transaminase activity were higher in the control siRNA-transfected ob/ob mice than in the control siRNA-transfected Lean mice, but these parameters were reduced by GRK2 siRNA transfection into the ob/ob mice. GRK2 expression in epididymal fat was not altered among the 3 groups, although hepatic GRK2 expression was higher in the control siRNA-transfected ob/ob mice than in the control siRNA-transfected Lean mice. Additionally, we found that Akt interacted with GRK2 in the liver. Furthermore, phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and JNK were higher in the epididymal fats from the control siRNA-transfected ob/ob mice than in those from the control siRNA-transfected Lean mice, but they were lowered by transfection with GRK2 siRNA. The study results showed that GRK2 siRNA improved blood triglyceride levels and abnormal or excessive activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases in epididymal fat. This effect may be promoted by inhibition of the NEFA production pathway in the liver. Therefore, the interaction of organs (hepatic GRK2-epididymal fat) may help improve insulin resistance and diabetes-associated pathophysiology.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetic autosomal disease characterized by abnormal cell-cell adhesion, cardiomyocyte death, progressive fibro-adipose replacement of the myocardium, arrhythmias and sudden death. Several different cell types contribute to the pathogenesis of ACM, including, as recently described, cardiac stromal cells (CStCs). In the present study, we aim to identify ACM-specific expression profiles of human CStCs derived from endomyocardial biopsies of ACM patients and healthy individuals employing TaqMan Low Density Arrays for miRNA expression profiling, and high throughput sequencing for gene expression quantification.RESULTS: We identified 3 miRNAs and 272 genes as significantly differentially expressed at a 5% false discovery rate. Both the differentially expressed genes as well as the target genes of the ACM-specific miRNAs were found to be enriched in cell adhesion-related biological processes. Functional similarity and protein interaction-based network analyses performed on the identified deregulated genes, miRNA targets and known ACM-causative genes revealed clusters of highly related genes involved in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, lipid transport and ephrin receptor signaling.CONCLUSIONS: We determined for the first time the coding and non-coding transcriptome characteristic of ACM cardiac stromal cells, finding evidence for a potential contribution of miRNAs, specifically miR-29b-3p, to ACM pathogenesis or phenotype maintenance.</p>

<p>Adiponectin, the most prevalent adipo-cytokine in plasma plays critical metabolic and anti-inflammatory roles is fast emerging as an important molecular target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Adiponectin action is critical in multiple organs including cardio-vascular system, muscle, liver, adipose tissue, brain and bone. Adiponectin signaling in bone has been a topic of active investigation lately. Human association studies and multiple mice models of gene deletion/modification failed to define a clear cause and effect of adiponectin signaling in bone. The most plausible reason could be the multimeric forms of adiponectin that display differential binding to receptors (adipoR1 and adipoR2) with cell-specific receptor variants in bone. Discovery of small molecule agonist of adipoR1 suggested a salutary role of this receptor in bone metabolism. The downstream signaling of adipoR1 in osteoblasts involves stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased differentiation via the likely suppression of wnt inhibitor, sclerostin. On the other hand, the inflammation modulatory effect of adiponectin signaling suppresses the RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor <U+03BA>-B ligand) - to - OPG (osteprotegerin) ratio in osteoblasts leading to the suppression of osteoclastogenic response. This review will discuss the adiponectin signaling and its role in skeletal homeostasis and critically assess whether adipoR1 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases.</p>

<p>Recruitment of brown/beige adipocytes (BAs) in white adipose tissue (WAT) involves proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) in concert with close interactions with resident immune cells. To deconvolve stromal cell heterogeneity in a comprehensive and unbiased fashion, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of &gt;33,000 stromal/vascular cells from epididymal WAT (eWAT) and inguinal WAT (iWAT) under control conditions and during ß3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) activation. scRNA-seq identified distinct ASC subpopulations in eWAT and iWAT that appeared to be differentially poised to enter the adipogenic pathway. ADRB3 activation triggered the dramatic appearance of proliferating ASCs in eWAT, whose differentiation into BAs could be inferred from a single time point. scRNA-seq identified various immune cell types in eWAT, including a proliferating macrophage subpopulation that occupies adipogenic niches. These results demonstrate the power of scRNA-seq to deconstruct adipogenic niches and suggest novel functional interactions among resident stromal cell subpopulations.</p>

<p>Incidental vascular lesions are being discovered at an increasing frequency due to widespread noninvasive brain imaging studies. One of these lesions has recently been termed a “pure arterial malformation” (PAM), which is defined as dilated, overlapping, and tortuous arteries forming a mass of arterial loops with a coil-like appearance in the absence of arteriovenous shunting. The pathogenesis of these lesions is not known, but a congenital etiology is suspected. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old female who was found to have a PAM of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery with adipose tissue interspersed within the arterial loops. The authors believe that this abnormal intracranial association between blood vessel and adipose tissue lends further support to the theory that PAMs are the result of a congenital malformation and are therefore safe to manage conservatively given their presumed benign natural history. Far from offering conclusive evidence, this unique case report adds to the growing body of PAM literature and strengthens an increasingly supported congenital theory of genesis.</p>

<p>Mesenteric adipose tissue hyperplasia is a hallmark of Crohn’s disease (CD). Recently, we showed that mesenteric adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) from CD, ulcerative colitis, and control patients synthesize and release adipokines in a disease-dependent manner. Here we examined the expression profiles of CD and control patient-derived mesenteric ADSCs and studied the effects of their extracellular mediators on colonocyte signaling in vitro and experimental colitis in vivo. ADSCs were isolated from mesenteric fat of control and CD patients. Microarray profiling and network analysis were performed in ADSCs and human colonocytes treated with conditioned media from cultured ADSCs. Mice with acute colitis received daily injections of conditioned media from patient-derived ADSCs, vehicle, or apolactoferrin. Proliferative responses were evaluated in conditioned media-treated colonocytes and mouse colonic epithelium. Total protein was isolated from cultured colonocytes after treatment with apolactoferrin for Western blot analysis of phosphorylated intracellular signaling kinases. Microarray profiling revealed differential mRNA expression in CD patient-derived ADSCs compared with controls, including lactoferrin. Administration of CD patient-derived medium or apolactoferrin increased colonocyte proliferation compared with controls. Conditioned media from CD patient-derived ADSCs or apolactoferrin attenuated colitis severity in mice and enhanced colonocyte proliferation in vivo. ADSCs from control and CD patients show disease-dependent inflammatory responses and alter colonic epithelial cell signaling in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate lactoferrin production by adipose tissue, specifically mesenteric ADSCs. We suggest that mesenteric ADSC-derived lactoferrin may mediate protective effects and participate in the pathophysiology of CD by promoting colonocyte proliferation and the resolution of inflammation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the morphometric and optical coherence tomography (OCT) characteristics of the microstructure of retroperitoneal peripancreatic adipose tissue during passive drainage and active perfusion-aspiration drainage for infected pancreatic necrosis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors analyzed 74 samples of peripancreatic adipose tissue obtained from 37 patients with passive (Group 1) and active perfusion-aspiration drainage (Group 2) of a focus of peripancreatitis. The tissues were examined with OCT, then fixed in a formalin solution and underwent histological examination, including morphometric one.RESULTS: The examined groups showed qualitative and quantitative differences in the tissue microstructure. In Group 1 samples, the proportion (median (upper quartile; lower quartile)) of interlobular connective tissue was 5.6 (3.9; 6.1)%; and that of adipocytes was 44.6 (41.2; 51.6)%. Necrotic tissue occupied 46.2 (35.6; 56.1)% of the area of specimens. The OCT images of necrotic tissue displayed a preponderance of unstructured regions with a high signal level while the parenchymal areas showed a cellular structured pattern. In Group 2 samples, the proportion of interlobular connective tissue was 16.2 (11.4; 19.7)%, and that of adipocytes was 68.5 (59.7; 71.2)%. At the same time, Group 2 exhibited necrosis - 14.4 (11.5; 19.2%) that was 3.2 times less than in Group 1. The OCT images of Group 2 samples showed a preponderance of cellular structured regions characteristic of the parenchyma, with pronounced stromal elements, which corresponded to the histological pattern.CONCLUSION: Active perfusion-aspiration drainage of peripancreatic adipose tissue versus passive drainage is associated with a smaller proportion of necrotic tissue (14.4% versus 46.2%; p=0.05) and a larger proportion of a stromal vascular component (16.2% vs. 5.6%; p=0.05). OCT could qualitatively distinguish viable fat tissue parenchyma from necrotic areas, without specially preparing the samples, which was confirmed by histomorphometric results.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in the roles of androgen in the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis (AS), hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, as well as in the disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. Androgen exerts its biological role mainly through binding to the androgen receptor (AR), one of the nuclear receptors widely expressed in multiple tissues such as the skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue and brain. Low testosterone and AR deficiency result in obesity, obesity-related diseases and metabolic disorders. Androgen regulates almost all the intracellular transduction pathways related to glucose and lipid metabolism, including key metabolic enzymes/proteins, nuclear transcription factors (PPAR<U+03B3>, LXRa and FoxO1), inflammation, leptin sensitivity of hypothalamus, proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte, mitochondrial function and vascular endothelial function. In addition, females with high androgen are more likely to develop obesity as well as glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This review focuses on the role and underlying mechanisms of androgen and AR in the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases as well as glucose and lipid metabolism disturbance in men.</p>

<p>IFN<U+03B3> is a cytokine with important roles in tissue homeostasis, immune and inflammatory responses and tumour immunosurveillance. Signalling by the IFN<U+03B3> receptor activates the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway to induce the expression of classical interferon-stimulated genes that have key immune effector functions. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the transcriptional, chromatin-based and metabolic mechanisms that underlie IFN<U+03B3>-mediated polarization of macrophages to an ‘M1-like’ state, which is characterized by increased pro-inflammatory activity and macrophage resistance to tolerogenic and anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, I describe the newly discovered effects of IFN<U+03B3> on other leukocytes, vascular cells, adipose tissue cells, neurons and tumour cells that have important implications for autoimmunity, metabolic diseases, atherosclerosis, neurological diseases and immune checkpoint blockade cancer therapy.</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: We investigated the expression levels of proteins associated with oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis in MSCs co-cultured with isolated ADASs from 6 donors’ SVFs under oxidative stress conditions. Our results imply that isolated ADASs from SVFs may inhibit oxidative stress-induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in MSCs via a p53-dependent pathway. Furthermore, we identified an anti-apoptotic mechanism involving oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by adipose-derived ADASs in MSCs for the first time. Our findings suggest that the positive effects of SVF implantation into damaged heart tissue may be attributed to the various actions of MSCs.</p>

<p>A growing body of evidence suggests a protective role of polyphenols and exercise training on the disorders of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to assess the effect of the açaí seed extract (ASE) associated with exercise training on diabetic complications induced by high-fat (HF) diet plus streptozotocin (STZ) in rats. Type 2 diabetes was induced by feeding rats with HF diet (55% fat) for 5 weeks and a single dose of STZ (35 mg/kg i.p.). Control (C) and Diabetic (D) animals were subdivided into four groups each: Sedentary, Training, ASE Sedentary, and ASE Training. ASE (200 mg/kg/day) was administered by gavage and the exercise training was performed on a treadmill (30min/day; 5 days/week) for 4 weeks after the diabetes induction. In type 2 diabetic rats, the treatment with ASE reduced blood glucose, insulin resistance, leptin and IL-6 levels, lipid profile, and vascular dysfunction. ASE increased the expression of insulin signaling proteins in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and plasma GLP-1 levels. ASE associated with exercise training potentiated the reduction of glycemia by decreasing TNF-a levels, increasing pAKT and adiponectin expressions in adipose tissue, and IR and pAMPK expressions in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic rats. In conclusion, ASE treatment has an antidiabetic effect in type 2 diabetic rats by activating the insulin-signaling pathway in muscle and adipose tissue, increasing GLP-1 levels, and an anti-inflammatory action. Exercise training potentiates the glucose-lowering effect of ASE by activating adiponectin-AMPK pathway and increasing IR expression.</p>

<p>With nearly 40% of U.S. adults obese, and childhood and adolescent rates rising, obesity and associated comorbidities are serious public health concerns with massive societal costs. Often, lifestyle interventions do not offer sufficient weight loss to improve health, requiring surgery and medications as adjunct management strategies. Here, we present a 4-month case study in which the sustained, low-dose, and constant administration of the thyroid receptor ß selective agonist GC-1 (sobetirome) from a novel nanochannel membrane implant was assessed in an obese, pre-diabetic rhesus macaque. Dramatic loss of white adipose tissue in the abdomen from 36 to 18% was observed via magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with normalized serum insulin and glycemia, with no signs of cardiotoxicity shown. The non-human primate study highlights sustained low-dose delivery of GC-1 from our minimally invasive subcutaneous implant as a valuable approach to induce weight loss and manage obesity and comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes.</p>

In addition, we identify significant and reversible changes of the intra-adipose vasculatures in the mice subjected to cold challenge (i.e., 4°).

<p>Preclinical and clinical research provide strong evidence that chronic, systemic inflammation plays a key role in development and progression of atherosclerosis. Indeed, chronic inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Contemporary research has demonstrated plausible mechanistic links between immune cell dysfunction and cardiometabolic disease in psoriasis. In this review, we describe the role of potential common immunological mechanisms underlying both psoriasis and atherogenesis. We primarily discuss innate and adaptive immune cell subsets and their contributions to psoriatic disease and cardiovascular morbidity. Emerging efforts should focus on understanding the interplay among immune cells, adipose tissue, and various biomarkers of immune dysfunction to provide direction for future targeted therapy.</p>

<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with hyperglycaemia and advanced glycosylation end-products. In the foot, the consequences of chronic or uncontrolled diabetes are micro and macrovascular disease, neuropathy, reduced joint mobility and structural and soft tissue changes that increase the risk of ulcer development and amputation. Diabetes foot assessment currently includes a comprehensive history, neurological and vascular assessments and examination focussed on dermatological and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Whilst these assessments are helpful for predicting ulceration risk, direct identifiers that enable early therapeutic intervention are lacking. The intention of this review was to ascertain if B-mode ultrasound could be clinically applied to identify structural change in the diabetic foot and be utilised as an early predictor of ulceration risk.</AbstractText>: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with hyperglycaemia and advanced glycosylation end-products.

<p>Lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Greenland Inuit, Northern Canada and Japan has been attributed to their consumption of seafood rich in long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA). While a large majority of pre-clinical and intervention trials have demonstrated heart health benefits of LCn-3PUFA, some studies have shown no effects or even negative effects. LCn-3PUFA have been shown to favourably modulate blood lipid levels, particularly a reduction in circulating levels of triglycerides. High density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are elevated following dietary supplementation with LCn-3PUFA. Although LCn-3PUFA have been shown to increase low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, the increase is primarily in the large-buoyant particles that are less atherogenic than small-dense LDL particles. The anti-inflammatory effects of LCn-3PUFA have been clearly outlined with inhibition of NFkB mediated cytokine production being the main mechanism. In addition, reduction in adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule, ICAM and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, VCAM-1) and leukotriene production have also been demonstrated following LCn-3PUFA supplementation. Anti-aggregatory effects of LCn-3PUFA have been a subject of controversy, however, recent studies showing sex-specific effects on platelet aggregation have helped resolve the effects on hyperactive platelets. Improvements in endothelium function, blood flow and blood pressure after LCn-3PUFA supplementation add to the mechanistic explanation on their cardio-protective effects. Modulation of adipose tissue secretions including pro-inflammatory mediators and adipokines by LCn-3PUFA has re-ignited interest in their cardiovascular health benefits. The aim of this narrative review is to filter out the reasons for possible disparity between cohort, mechanistic, pre-clinical and clinical studies. The focus of the article is to provide possible explanation for the observed controversies surrounding heart health benefits of LCn-3PUFA.</p>

<p>NaoXinTong Capsule (NXT), a Chinese medicine, is currently used to treat patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clinical observations indicate its anti-diabetic functions with unclear mechanisms. Herein, we report the effect of NXT on diabetic nephropathy (DN). Type 2 diabetic db/db mice were treated with NXT for 14 weeks. In the course of treatment, NXT reduced diabetes-increased glucose levels and improved renal functions. At the end of treatment, we found that NXT ameliorated serum lipid profiles and other biochemical parameters. In the kidney, NXT inhibited mesangial matrix expansion, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A, fibronectin, advanced glycation end product and its receptor. Meanwhile, it reduced the diabetes-induced podocyte injury by increasing WT1 and nephrin expression. In addition, NXT inhibited accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins by increasing MMP2/9 expression through inactivation of TGFß/Smad pathway and CTGF expression. Mechanically, NXT activated insulin signaling pathway by increasing expression of INSR, IRS and FGF21, phosphorylation of Akt and AMPKa in the liver, INSR phosphorylation in the kidney, and FGF21 and GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NXT inhibits DN by ameliorating glucose/lipid metabolism, maintaining tissue structure integrity, and correcting diabetes-induced renal dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Objective- The E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL (inducible degrader of the LDLR [LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor]) is a post-transcriptional regulator of LDLR abundance. Model systems and human genetics support a role for IDOL in regulating circulating LDL levels. Whether IDOL plays a broader metabolic role and affects development of metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities is unknown. Approach and Results- We studied WT (wild type) and Idol<sup>(-/-)</sup> (Idol-KO) mice in 2 models: physiological aging and diet-induced obesity. In both models, deletion of Idol protected mice from metabolic dysfunction. On a Western-type diet, Idol loss resulted in decreased circulating levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. This was accompanied by protection from weight gain in short- and long-term dietary challenges, which could be attributed to reduced hepatosteatosis and fat mass in Idol-KO mice. Although feeding and intestinal fat uptake were unchanged in Idol-KO mice, their brown adipose tissue was protected from lipid accumulation and had elevated expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) and TH (tyrosine hydroxylase). Indirect calorimetry indicated a marked increase in locomotion and suggested a trend toward increased cumulative energy expenditure and fat oxidation. An increase in in vivo clearance of reconstituted lipoprotein particles in Idol-KO mice may sustain this energetic demand. In the BXD mouse genetic reference population, hepatic Idol expression correlates with multiple metabolic parameters, thus providing support for findings in the Idol-KO mice. Conclusions- Our study uncovers an unrecognized role for Idol in regulation of whole body metabolism in physiological aging and on a Western-type diet. These findings support Idol inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target multiple metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death in obese and diabetic patients. In these groups of patients, the alterations of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) contribute to both vascular and myocardial dysfunction. Therefore, it is of clinical interest to determine the mechanisms by which EAT influences cardiovascular disease. Two key factors contribute to the tight intercommunication among EAT, coronary arteries and myocardium. One is the close anatomical proximity between these tissues. The other is the capacity of EAT to secrete cytokines and other molecules with paracrine and vasocrine effects on the cardiovascular system. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that EAT thickness is associated with not only metabolic syndrome but also atherosclerosis and heart failure. The evaluation of EAT using imaging modalities, although effective, presents several disadvantages including radiation exposure, limited availability and elevated costs. Therefore, there is a clinical interest in EAT as a source of new biomarkers of cardiovascular and endocrine alterations. In this review, we revise the mechanisms involved in the protective and pathological role of EAT and present the molecules released by EAT with greater potential to become biomarkers of cardiometabolic alterations.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) contains well-developed vascular networks. Pathological AT expansion often accompany the reduction in AT blood vessels, which further exacerbates adipocyte dysfunction due to hypoxia; however, it remains unclear whether AT vascular rarefaction is simply secondary to adipocyte hypertrophy, or if there is an actively regulated pathway that mediates impaired AT angiogenesis in obesity. We searched for growth factors whose expression in AT is down-regulated in obesity; accordingly, we identified neuregulin-4 (Nrg4), a member of the EGF family of proteins. Nrg4 is highly and preferentially expressed in healthy adipocytes, while its expression was substantially reduced in obesity. Nrg4 activated endothelial angiogenic functions and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Genetic loss of Nrg4 caused reduction in brown and white AT blood vessels, and induced overweight even while consuming normal chow. Conditional knockout of Nrg4 in brown adipocytes caused blood vessel reduction in brown but not in white AT, and was sufficient to induce obese phenotype. Our data demonstrated that Nrg4 plays a critical role in maintaining AT vasculature and its metabolic functions. Considering the substantial reduction of Nrg4 in obesity, disruption of Nrg4-mediated angiogenesis could be an active mechanism for the obesity-associated vascular rarefaction in AT, and thus Nrg4 is an attracting pharmacotherapeutic target in the prevention and/or treatment of obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>Tissue-engineered scaffolds are a powerful means of healing craniofacial bone defects arising from trauma or disease. Murine models of critical-sized bone defects are especially useful in understanding the role of microenvironmental factors such as vascularization on bone regeneration. Here, we demonstrate the capability of a novel multimodality imaging platform capable of acquiring in vivo images of microvascular architecture, microvascular blood flow, and tracer/cell tracking via intrinsic optical signaling (IOS), laser speckle contrast (LSC), and fluorescence (FL) imaging, respectively, in a critical-sized calvarial defect model. Defects that were 4<U+2009>mm in diameter were made in the calvarial regions of mice followed by the implantation of osteoconductive scaffolds loaded with human adipose-derived stem cells embedded in fibrin gel. Using IOS imaging, we were able to visualize microvascular angiogenesis at the graft site and extracted morphological information such as vessel radius, length, and tortuosity two weeks after scaffold implantation. FL imaging allowed us to assess functional characteristics of the angiogenic vessel bed, such as time-to-peak of a fluorescent tracer, and also allowed us to track the distribution of fluorescently tagged human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Finally, we used LSC to characterize the in vivo hemodynamic response and maturity of the remodeled microvessels in the scaffold microenvironment. In this study, we provide a methodical framework for imaging tissue-engineered scaffolds, processing the images to extract key microenvironmental parameters, and visualizing these data in a manner that enables the characterization of the vascular phenotype and its effect on bone regeneration. Such multimodality imaging platforms can inform optimization and design of tissue-engineered scaffolds and elucidate the factors that promote enhanced vascularization and bone formation.</p>

<p>Vascularized adipose tissue models are highly demanded as alternative to existing animal models to elucidate the mechanisms of widespread diseases, screen for new drugs or asses corresponding safety levels. Standardly used animal-derived sera therein, are associated to ethical concerns, the risk of contaminations and many uncertainties in their composition and impact on cells. Therefore their use should be completely omitted. In this study we developed a serum-free, defined co-culture medium and implemented it to set up an adipocyte-endothelial cell (EC) co-culture model. Human adipose-derived stem cells were differentiated under defined conditions (diffASCs) and, like human microvascular ECs (mvECs), cultured in a developed defined co-culture medium in mono-, indirect or direct co-culture for 14 days. The developed defined co-culture medium was superior to compared mono-culture media and facilitated the functional maintenance and maturation of diffASCs including perilipin A expression, lipid accumulation and glycerol and leptin release. The medium equally allowed mvEC maintenance, confirmed by the expression of CD31 and vWF and acLDL uptake. Thereby mvECs showed a strong dependency on EC-specific factors. Additionally the development of vascular structures by mvECs was facilitated when directly co-cultured with diffASCs. The completely defined co-culture system allows for the serum-free setup of adipocyte/EC co-cultures and thereby represents a valuable and ethically acceptable tool for the setup of vascularized adipose tissue models.</p>

<p>Parathyroid glands are the main regulator of body mineral metabolism through parathormone (PTH) actions on bone and kidney. Experimental evidence suggests that PTH may have non-classical target organs such as adipose tissue, arterial vascular wall, cardiac muscle cells, and adrenal cortex cells, where it may play a role in controlling body energy, blood pressure, and metabolism. Cardiometabolic features have been investigated in the wide spectrum of clinical parathyroid disorders, from hyperparathyroidism to pseudohypoparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Indeed, in parathyroid disorders, besides altered PTH secretion, impaired serum calcium levels and vitamin D status occur. Both calcium and vitamin D have been shown to regulate metabolism and to be associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, despite the complexity of parathyroid disorders, features of metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance, arterial blood hypertension, and dyslipidemia, are frequently diagnosed in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism as well as in pseudohyperparathyroidism. Here, we reviewed the most consistent data highlighting challenges and providing clinical remarks.</p>

<p>Cushing’s syndrome (CS), including visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes among its many manifestations, is “a model” of metabolic syndrome. Glucocorticoid (GC) excess, through a combination of effects on liver, muscle, adipose tissue and pancreas, increases gluconeogenesis and impairs insulin sensitivity, leading to carbohydrate abnormalities. Dyslipidemia is a common finding in CS as a consequence of GC-related increased lipolysis, lipogenesis and adipogenesis. CS patients experience typical changes in body composition, with fat redistribution resulting in accumulation of visceral adipose tissue. Hypertension, myocardial and vascular abnormalities along with the metabolic changes and the characteristic coagulopathy increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Metabolic syndrome features can persist long after normalisation of cortisol levels.</p>

<p>Increased peripheral conduit artery stiffness has been shown in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction. However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon extends to the coronary vasculature. HF with preserved ejection fraction may be driven, in part, by coronary inflammation, and inhibition of the enzyme DPP-4 (dipeptidyl-peptidase 4) reduces inflammation and oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of saxagliptin-a DPP-4 inhibitor-on coronary stiffness in aortic-banded mini swine. We hypothesized saxagliptin would prevent increased coronary artery stiffness in a translational swine model with cardiac features of HF with preserved ejection fraction by inhibiting perivascular adipose tissue inflammation. Yucatan mini swine were divided into 3 groups: control, aortic-banded untreated HF, and aortic-banded saxagliptin-treated HF. Ex vivo mechanical testing was performed on the left circumflex and right coronary arteries, and advanced glycation end product, NF-<U+03BA>B (nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B), and nitrotyrosine levels were measured. An increase in the coronary elastic modulus of HF animals was associated with increased vascular advanced glycation end products, NF-<U+03BA>B, and nitrotyrosine levels compared with control and prevented by saxagliptin treatment. Aortas from healthy mice were treated with media from swine perivascular adipose tissue culture to assess its role on vascular stiffening. Conditioned media from HF and saxagliptin-treated HF animals increased mouse aortic stiffness; however, only perivascular adipose tissue from the HF group showed increased advanced glycation end products and NF-<U+03BA>B levels. In conclusion, our data show increased coronary conduit vascular stiffness was prevented by saxagliptin and associated with decreased advanced glycation end products, NF-<U+03BA>B, and nitrotyrosine levels in a swine model with potential relevance to HF with preserved ejection fraction.</p>

<p>Dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA) is the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis. Adipocytes express soluble intracellular PA-specific phosphatases (Lipins) and broader specificity membrane-associated lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) that can also dephosphorylate PA. Inactivation of lipin1 causes lipodystrophy in mice due to defective developmental adipogenesis. Triglyceride synthesis is diminished but not ablated by inactivation of lipin1 in differentiated adipocytes implicating other PA phosphatases in this process. To investigate the possible role of LPPs in adipocyte lipid metabolism and signaling we made mice with adipocyte-targeted inactivation of LPP3 encoded by the Plpp3(Ppap2b) gene. Adipocyte LPP3 deficiency resulted in blunted ceramide and sphingomyelin accumulation during diet-induced adipose tissue expansion, accumulation of the LPP3 substrate sphingosine 1- phosphate, and reduced expression of serine palmitoyl transferase. However, adiposity was unaffected by LPP3 deficiency on standard, high fat diet or Western diets, although Western diet-fed mice with adipocyte LPP3 deficiency exhibited improved glucose tolerance. Our results demonstrate functional compartmentalization of lipid phosphatase activity in adipocytes and identify an unexpected role for LPP3 in the regulation of diet-dependent sphingolipid synthesis that may impact on insulin signaling.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: We discuss the influence that involvement of fat (perirenal, sinus) and vascular structures (renal vein, segmental veins) have on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates in renal cancer.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 140 stage pT3a kidney tumors (114 clear cell, 9 type I papillary, 6 type II papillary, 11 chromophobe) surgically treated between 1997 and 2015. We conducted a cancer-specific survival study (Kaplan Meier) and a univariate and multivariate analysis of the variables: perirenal fat invasion, sinus fat invasion, renal vein invasion, segmental vein invasion and Fuhrman grade.RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 79 months, 47 deaths occurred overall (31.7%), 29 of which were due to the kidney tumor (CSM 20%). There were 50 cases of vascular invasion (35.7%), 40 cases with fat only invasion (28.6%) and 50 cases with invasion of both (35.7%). In the survival study, fat invasion had the least impact (17%), and invasion of both (fat and vascular structures) had the worst survival (48% of total mortality). Vascular invasion represents 35% of the mortality rate. In the multivariate study, Fuhrman grade 3-4 (HR 10.7), renal vein invasion (HR 9.2) and concomitant vascular and fat invasion (HR 5.6) are the factors with the greatest impact.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor fat invasion has a lower impact on the CSM of kidney cancer than vascular invasion.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND The current study was designed to explore the pathway through which adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) affect brain ischemic injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS The improving effect of ADMSCs on the brain function and structure was evaluated in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. The permeability of the brain-blood barrier (BBB), inflammatory response, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related signaling induced by ischemia were determined. RESULTS The administration of ADMSCs decreased neurological severity score when compared with that in the MCAO group and also restricted the brain infarction area as well as cell apoptosis. ADMSCs suppressed the inflammation in brains by decreasing the expressions of IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a, contributing to the decreased permeability of the BBB. The expressions of pro-apoptosis factors in ER stress were inhibited while that of anti-apoptosis factors were induced. CONCLUSIONS ADMSCs affected brain injury in multiple ways, not only by suppressing inflammation in the brain infarction area, but also by blocking ER stress-induced apoptosis.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is now recognized as a functional organ that contains cellular heterogeneity and diversity within anatomical depots. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose contains endothelial progenitors, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages, pericytes, pre-adipocytes, and stromal/stem cells, among others. In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation of the influence of age and gender in the field of stem cell biology. Yet few studies have evaluated the influence of biological age or sex on either SVF cell heterogeneity or immunophenotype. To address this issue, the current study has compared the flow cytometric characteristics between murine SVF of inguinal (iWAT), epidydimal (eWAT), and brown (BAT) adipose tissue of male and female, as well as young (6-8 week) and middle-aged (8-12 month) male C57BL/6 mice. Murine gender comparisons revealed male iWAT expressed higher percentages of leukocyte and CD34<sup>+</sup> ASC-like sub-populations than female iWAT. Murine age comparisons revealed younger male iWAT, eWAT, and BAT SVF all contained a significantly higher percentage of pre-adipocytes, HSC-like cells, CD25<sup>-</sup>, and FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T-regulatory cells compared to SVF from middle-aged male mice. These findings highlight the potential contribution of biological variables on adipose-derived cell applications and experimental outcomes.</p>

<p>Improved process technologies have allowed fishing vessels to utilize residuals from cod fillet production (head, backbone, skin, cuttings, and entrails) and convert this to high-quality protein powders for human consumption. In this double-blind pilot study, 42 healthy overweight or obese adults were randomized to three experimental groups consuming tablets corresponding to 6 g/day of proteins from cod residuals as presscake meal (Cod-PC), presscake and stickwater meal (Cod-PCW), or placebo tablets (control) for eight weeks. The primary outcome of this study was changes in metabolites related to glucose regulation in overweight or obese healthy adults after intake of proteins from cod residuals. Cod-PC supplementation decreased postprandial serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration and increased gene expressions of diglyceride acyltransferase 1 and 2 in subcutaneous adipose tissue compared with controls. Fasting insulin increased while fasting NEFA and 120-min postprandial glucose decreased within the Cod-PC group, but these changes did not differ from the other groups. In conclusion, supplementation with Cod-PC beneficially affected postprandial serum NEFA concentration compared with the other groups in overweight or obese adults. Supplementation with Cod-PCW, which contains a higher fraction of water-soluble protein compared to Cod-PC, did not affect serum markers of glucose regulation.</p>

<p>Ultrasound (US) can reveal the presence of steatosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but its diagnostic accuracy to reveal signs of fibrosis is low except in advanced stages of disease (e.g. cirrhosis). Current guidelines suggest the use of clinical algorithms, such as the NAFLD fibrosis score, and elastography to predict the progression of fibrosis, and the integration of elastography improves the detection accuracy of liver stiffness. However, there is a lack of evidence about the correlation between clinical algorithms and conventional US, and elastography is limited by the relative low diffusion, necessity of training, and loss of diagnostic accuracy in patients with high body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or increased thickness of parietal walls, with consequent significant rates of failure of measurement of liver stiffness. Recently, the measurement of hepatic artery resistive index (HARI) has demonstrated a significant positive correlation with fibrosis degree, as measured with NAFLD fibrosis score, suggesting that the fibrous tissue accumulation may result in increased arterial rigidity and, therefore, in a rise of resistance to flow, and that the different tissue composition of the liver (adipose versus fibrous) can influence HARI differently. These issues should be further investigated because some aspects are still unknown. The limited data currently justify the need of larger, prospective studies aimed at assessing whether HARI correlates with elastography results. In view of their effect on weight loss, serum lipid concentration, and hepatic arterial flow hemodynamics, it could be interesting to evaluate if lifestyle and diet changes can influence significantly HARI values in NAFLD patients.</p>

<p>Epicardial adipose tissues (EATs) and vascular tissues may both belong to the mesoepithelial lineage that develops from epicardium-derived progenitor cells (EPDCs) in developing and injured hearts. Very little is known of the molecular mechanisms of EPDC contribution in EAT development and neovascularization in adult heart, which the topic remains a subject of intense therapeutic interest and scientific debate. Here we studied the epigenetic control of stemness and anti-adipogenic and pro-vasculogenic fate of human EPDCs (hEPDCs), through investigating an angiogenic hormone, prokineticin-2 (PK2) signaling via its receptor PKR1. We found that hEPDCs spontaneously undergoes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and are not predestined for the vascular lineages. However, PK2 via a histone demethylase KDM6A inhibits EMT, and induces asymmetric division, leading to self-renewal and formation of vascular and epithelial/endothelial precursors with angiogenic potential capable of differentiating into vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. PK2 upregulates and activates KDM6A to inhibit repressive histone H3K27me3 marks on promoters of vascular genes (Flk-1 and SM22a) involved in vascular lineage commitment and maturation. In PK2-mediated anti-adipogenic signaling, KDM6A stabilizes and increases cytoplasmic ß-catenin levels to repress peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> expression and activity. Our findings offer additional molecular targets to manipulate hEPDCs-involved tissue repair/regeneration in cardiometabolic and ischemic heart diseases. Stem Cells 2018;36:1589-1602.</p>

<p>Organotin compounds (OTs) are synthetic persistent organometallic xenobiotics widely used in several commercial applications. They exert well-described harmful effects in brain, liver, adipose tissue, and reproductive organs, as they are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), but the effects in the kidneys are less known. The kidneys are especially vulnerable to environmental contaminants because they are a metabolizing site of xenobiotics, therefore, pollutants can accumulate in renal tissue, leading to impaired renal function and to several renal abnormalities. Individuals chronically exposed to OTs present a threefold increase in the prevalence of kidney stones. These compounds can directly inhibit H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in renal intercalated cells, resulting in hypokalemia, renal tubular acidity, and increased urinary pH, which is a known risk factor for kidney stones formation. OTs effects are not only limited to induce nephrolithiasis, its nephrotoxicity is also due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). This increase leads to lipid peroxidation, abnormal cellular function, and cell death. Combined, the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense systems become deficient and there is a consequent uncontrolled generation of ROS that culminates in renal tissue damage. Still, few epidemiological and experimental studies have reported renal impact correlated to OTs exposure. This lack of investigation of the complete effect of OTs in renal function and structure led us to perform this review reporting the main researches about this subject.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: It is known that obesity is associated with alterations in blood rheology and venous hemodynamics. Another recent study has confirmed that adipose tissue is actively involved in angiogenesis through secretion of biologically active substances.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact on the venous haemodynamics of the femoral vein on angiogenesis status in morbidly obese patients.METHODS: We studied venous haemodynamics and angiogenesis in a prospective study of obese and non-obese individuals. The venous wall shear stress (WSS) was calculated from the blood viscosity and the shear rate was calculated assuming Newton’s law. Angiogenesis was detected using Bio-Plex Pro Human Angiogenesis Multiplex Assays (Bio-Plex 200 Systems).RESULTS: The shear rate (P &lt; 0.000005) and the wall shear stress (P &lt; 0.01) were significantly lower in the obese patients compared with the control subjects. All angiogenesis biomarkers were significantly higher in obese patients compared to the control group. Multivariate analyses identified waist circumference as an independent predictor for PECAM-1 (ß = - 0.69, P &lt; 0.0001) and for VEGF (ß = - 0.60, P &lt; 0.001); analyses identified WSS as an independent predictor for follistatin (ß = - 0.59, P &lt; 0.001), for PECAM-1 (ß = - 036, P &lt; 0.05) and for VEGF (ß = - 0.42, P &lt; 0.05). For angiopoietin 2 (ß = - 0.35, P = 0.064) and HGF (ß = - 0.31, P = 0.074), WSS tended to be a significant predictor.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that obesity-associated decreases in shear stress of the venous system lead to upregulation of angiogenesis, expressed by increased levels of endogenous positive regulators of angiogenesis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Autologous fat injection is a procedure aimed at eliminating grave defects in the skin surface by subcutaneous injection of the patient’s fatty tissue. Fat embolism is a rare but severe complication of this procedure, especially cerebral infarction. It is first reported by Thaunat in 2004.METHODS: were presented to the hospital with sudden unconsciousness and left limb weakness in 24<U+200A>hours after facial fat injection. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed immediately after admission. Frontal temporoparietal decompressive craniectomy plus multiple treatments scheduled for patients. Pictures and videos were taken during follow-up. Figures are edited with Adobe Photograph CS6.RESULTS: Patients were diagnosed with extensive cerebral infarction of the right hemisphere through the middle cerebral artery or facial-intracranial branches.CONCLUSION: Routine cosmetic procedures of facial fat injections could cause devastating and even fatal complications to patients. The small volume of fat grafts can be inserted through the internal carotid artery or go through the communicating branches between the facial artery and the intracranial artery into the brain.</p>

<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding 20-25 nt RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by posttranscriptional repression of messenger RNA. There have been few investigations on the profiles and functions of miRNAs in ovine subcutaneous fat; their roles in the metabolism and deposition of subcutaneous fat also remain unclear. In this study, small RNA libraries were constructed for 2 important Chinese local sheep breeds, Small-tailed Han Sheep, and Shanxi Meat Sheep Dam Line, and used for high-throughput sequencing. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, revealing the effect of miR-124-3p on adipogenic differentiation by targeting C/EBPa. Our results provide both a comprehensive understanding of miRNA expression patterns in sheep subcutaneous fat and an insight into the specific roles of miRNAs in adipogenesis.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue produces different inflammatory cytokines which compromise bone mineral accrual during puberty. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin (IL)-8, and interferon-gamma (IFN-<U+03B3>) are significantly related to bone mineral accrual during pubertal maturation in boys with different BMI values.INTRODUCTION: This longitudinal study aims to identify the inflammatory markers that most strongly associate with pubertal bone mineral density (BMD) increment in boys with overweight and obesity (OWB).METHODS: Twenty-six OWB and 29 normal-weight boys were followed yearly for 3 years to measure changes in 12 serum inflammatory markers, BMD (by DXA), and apparent volumetric BMD. The OWB group was further divided into two subgroups according to their BMI gain during the 3-year period. Data through time points presented as slopes were used to calculate correlation coefficients to explore the possible relationships between variables of interest. In the whole study group, linear mixed effects (LME) models were also used.RESULTS: Increment in serum VEGF concentration was inversely associated with an increase in total body (TB) BMD (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.82, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02) and TB bone mineral content (BMC)/height (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.82, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02) in those OWB whose BMI gain was higher during pubertal years. In the whole study group, the LME model confirmed the inverse association between VEGF and TB BMC/height (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). EGF was inversely associated with LS BMD and LS BMAD (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05), whereas there was a positive association between IL-8 and TB BMAD and between IFN-<U+03B3> and LS BMD (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Lower increment in BMD in OWB with higher BMI gain is associated with increasing serum VEGF concentration during pubertal maturation. VEGF, EGF, IL-8, and IFN-<U+03B3> are significantly associated with BMD during pubertal maturation in boys with different BMI values.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) is no longer viewed as a passive, energy-storing depot, and a growing body of evidence supports the concept that both quantitative and qualitative aspects of AT are critical in determining an individual’s cardiometabolic risk profile. Among all AT sites, perivascular AT (PVAT) has emerged as a depot with a distinctive biological significance in cardiovascular disease given its close anatomical proximity to the vasculature. Recent studies have suggested the presence of complex, bidirectional paracrine and vasocrine signalling pathways between the vascular wall and its PVAT, with far-reaching implications in cardiovascular diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we first discuss the biological role of PVAT in both cardiovascular health and disease, highlighting its dual pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic roles, as well as potential therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease. We then review current evidence and promising new modalities on the non-invasive imaging of epicardial AT and PVAT. Specifically, we present how our expanding knowledge on the bidirectional interplay between the vascular wall and its PVAT can be translated into novel clinical diagnostics tools to assess coronary inflammation. To this end, we present the example of a new CT-based method that tracks spatial changes in PVAT phenotype to extract information about the inflammatory status of the adjacent vasculature, highlighting the numerous diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities that arise from our increased understanding of PVAT biology.</p>

<p>The biguanide metformin (MET) has been used during pregnancy for treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes. MET crosses the placenta and maternal treatment can expose the progeny to this drug during important phases of body development. Direct vascular protective effects have been described with the treatment of metformin. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether intrauterine exposure to metformin is safe for the vascular system of offspring. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the intrinsic effects of metformin exposure in utero in the offspring abdominal aorta reactivity, in the presence and absence of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and endothelium. For this, Wistar rats were treated with metformin 293<U+202F>mg/kg/day (MET) or water (CTR) by gavage during the gestational period. The abdominal aorta reactivity to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside was evaluated in male adult offspring. It was observed that abdominal aorta relaxation was similar between MET and CTR groups in the presence or absence of PVAT. In addition, the contraction to phenylephrine was similar between MET and CTR groups in the presence and absence of PVAT and endothelium. Therefore, metformin exposure during pregnancy had no intrinsic effect on the offspring abdominal aorta PVAT and endothelial function, demonstrating it to be safe to the vascular system of the offspring.</p>

However, these cells quickly lose their functional capabilities in vitro. Here, we aim to use the secretome of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to improve in vitro maintenance conditions for hepatocytes.In this experimental study, following serum deprivation, human adipose tissue-derived MSCs (hAT-MSCs) were cultured for 24 hours under normoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) conditions. Their conditioned media (CM) were subsequently collected and labeled as N-CM (normoxia) and H-CM (hypoxia). Murine hepatocytes were isolated by perfusion of mouse liver with collagenase, and were cultured in hepatocyte basal (William’s) medium supplemented with 4% N-CM or H-CM. Untreated William’s and hepatocyte-specific media (HepZYM) were used as controls. Finally, we evaluated the survival and proliferation rates, as well as functionality and hepatocyte-specific gene expressions of the cells.</AbstractText>: In this experimental study, following serum deprivation, human adipose tissue-derived MSCs (hAT-MSCs) were cultured for 24 hours under normoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) conditions.

<p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized thermogenic organ in mammals. The ability of BAT mitochondria to generate heat in response to cold-challenge to maintain core body temperature is essential for organismal survival. While cold activated BAT mitochondrial biogenesis is recognized as critical for thermogenic adaptation, the contribution of mitochondrial quality control to this process remains unclear. Here, we show mitophagy is required for brown adipocyte mitochondrial homeostasis during thermogenic adaptation. Mitophagy is significantly increased in BAT from cold-challenged mice (4<U+2009>°C) and in ß-agonist treated brown adipocytes. Blockade of mitophagy compromises brown adipocytes mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OX-PHOS) capacity, as well as BAT mitochondrial integrity. Mechanistically, cold-challenge induction of BAT mitophagy is UCP1-dependent. Furthermore, our results indicate that mitophagy coordinates with mitochondrial biogenesis, maintaining activated BAT mitochondrial homeostasis. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro findings identify mitophagy as critical for brown adipocyte mitochondrial homeostasis during cold adaptation.</p>

<p>Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) represents a promising scaffold for adipose tissue engineering. However, the unique and prolonged lipid removal process required for adipose tissue can damage extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. Moreover, inadequate vascularization limits the recellularization of DAT in vivo. We proposed a neo-mechanical protocol for rapidly breaking adipocytes and removing lipid content from adipose tissue. The lipid-depleted adipose tissue was then subjected to a fast and mild decellularization to fabricate high-quality DAT (M-DAT). Adipose liquid extract (ALE) derived from this mechanical process was collected and incorporated into M-DAT to further optimize in vivo recellularization. Ordinary DAT was fabricated and served as a control. This developed strategy was evaluated based on decellularization efficiency, ECM quality, and recellularization efficiency. Angiogenic factor components and angiogenic potential of ALE were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. M-DAT achieved the same decellularization efficiency, but exhibited better retention of ECM components and recellularization, compared with those with ordinary DAT. Protein quantification revealed considerable levels of angiogenic factors (basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-ß1, and vascular endothelial growth factor) in ALE. ALE promoted tube formation in vitro and induced intense angiogenesis in M-DAT in vivo; furthermore, higher expression of the adipogenic factor PPAR<U+03B3> and greater numbers of adipocytes were evident following ALE treatment, compared with those in the M-DAT group. Mechanical processing of adipose tissue led to the production of high-quality M-DAT and angiogenic factor-enriched ALE. The combination of ALE and M-DAT could be a promising strategy for engineered adipose tissue construction.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and it is hypothesized that fibrosis or excess accumulation of extracellular matrix within adipose tissue may limit tissue expansion contributing to metabolic dysfunction. The pathways that control adipose tissue remodeling are only partially understood, however it is likely that adipose tissue stromal and perivascular progenitors participate in fibrotic remodeling and also serve as adipocyte progenitors. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the secreted extracellular matrix protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) on adipose progenitor differentiation in the context of adipose tissue fibrosis. Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse cells with recombinant ACLP suppressed adipogenesis and enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, which was dependent on transforming growth factor-ß receptor kinase activity. Mice fed a chronic high fat diet exhibited white adipose tissue fibrosis with elevated ACLP expression and cellular fractionation of these depots revealed that ACLP was co-expressed with collagens primarily in the inflammatory cell depleted stromal-vascular fraction (SVF). SVF cells isolated from mice fed a high fat diet secreted increased amounts of ACLP compared to low fat diet control SVF. These cells also exhibited reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Importantly, differentiation studies in primary human adipose stromal cells revealed that mature adipocytes do not express ACLP and exogenous ACLP administration blunted their differentiation potential while upregulating myofibroblastic markers. Collectively, these studies identify ACLP as a stromal derived mediator of adipose progenitor differentiation that may limit adipocyte expansion during white adipose tissue fibrosis.</p>

<p>Different adipose tissue (AT) depots are associated with multiple metabolic risks. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is involved in adipocyte physiology and PDE5 inhibition may affect adipogenesis and ameliorate white AT quality. The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of AT and the composition of the stroma-vascular fraction (SVF) of subcutaneous AT (SAT) in type 2 diabetic mice after prolonged treatment with a PDE5 inhibitor, Sildenafil. 18 db/db mice were treated with Sildenafil or vehicle for 12 weeks. AT distribution was monitored and SAT was processed for isolation of SVF by flow cytometry. Sildenafil induced an overall reduction in AT, mainly in visceral AT (VAT), compared with SAT. In Sildenafil-treated mice, the mean change in body weight from baseline positively correlated with VAT, but not with SAT. Characterization of SVF of SAT showed an increase in the frequency of M2 macrophages and endothelial cells in treated mice. Sildenafil improved the maintenance of SAT homeostasis and distribution.</p>

<p>Physical training (PT) has been considered as a treatment in metabolic syndrome (MS), since it induces thermogenic activity in brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues. We evaluated the therapeutic effect of PT on activity of WAT and BAT in rats with MS induced by high-fat diet (30% lard) for 13 weeks and submitted, for the last 6 weeks, to swimming or kept sedentary (SED) rats. MS-SED rats compared to control diet (CT-SED) rats showed low physical fitness and high levels of glucose, insulin, homeostasis evaluation of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis evaluation of the functional capacity of ß-cells (HOMA-ß), and blood pressure. The gastrocnemius muscle decreased in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and beta (PGC-1a, PGC-1ß), and uncoupled protein 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3) expressions. Both WAT and BAT increased in the adipocyte area and decreased in blood vessels and fibroblast numbers. WAT increased in expression of pro-inflammatory adipokines and decreased in anti-inflammatory adipokine and adiponectin. WAT and gastrocnemius showed impairment in the insulin signaling pathway. In response to PT, MS rats showed increased physical fitness and restoration of certain biometric and biochemical parameters and blood pressure. PT also induced thermogenic modulations in skeletal muscle, WAT and BAT, and also improved the insulin signaling pathway. Collectively, PT was effective in treating MS by inducing improvement in physical fitness and interchangeable effects between skeletal muscle, WAT and BAT, suggesting a development of brown-like adipocyte cells.</p>

<p>Morphological and physiological changes in the vasculature have been described in the evolution and maintenance of hypertension. Hypertension-induced vascular dysfunction may present itself as a contributing, or consequential factor, to vascular remodeling caused by chronically elevated systemic arterial blood pressure. Changes in all vessel layers, from the endothelium to the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), have been described. This mini-review focuses on the current knowledge of the structure and function of the vessel layers, specifically muscular arteries: intima, media, adventitia, PVAT, and the cell types harbored within each vessel layer. The contributions of each cell type to vessel homeostasis and pathophysiological development of hypertension will be highlighted.</p>

<p>Concomitantly with the increase in the prevalences of overweight/obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has worldwide become the main cause of chronic liver disease in both adults and children. Patients with fatty liver display features of metabolic syndrome (MetS), like insulin resistance (IR), glucose intolerance, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Recently, epidemiological studies have linked obesity, MetS, and NAFLD to decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis, highlighting an intricate interplay among bone, adipose tissue, and liver. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), an important symbol of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B/OPG system activation, typically considered for its role in bone metabolism, may also play critical roles in the initiation and perpetuation of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical data have indicated that OPG concentrations are associated with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular calcification, endothelial dysfunction, and severity of liver damage in chronic hepatitis C. Nonetheless, the relationship between circulating OPG and IR as a key feature of MetS as well as between OPG and NAFLD remains uncertain. Thus, the aims of the present review are to provide the existent knowledge on these associations and to discuss briefly the underlying mechanisms linking OPG and NAFLD.</p>

<p>Epicardial adipose tissue has unique properties that distinguish it from other depots of visceral fat. Rather than having distinct boundaries, the epicardium shares an unobstructed microcirculation with the underlying myocardium, and in healthy conditions, produces cytokines that nourish the heart. However, in chronic inflammatory disorders (especially those leading to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), the epicardium becomes a site of deranged adipogenesis, leading to the secretion of proinflammatory adipokines that can cause atrial and ventricular fibrosis. Accordingly, in patients at risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, drugs that promote the accumulation or inflammation of epicardial adipocytes may lead to heart failure, whereas treatments that ameliorate the proinflammatory characteristics of epicardial fat may reduce the risk of heart failure. These observations suggest that epicardial adipose tissue is a transducer of the adverse effects of systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders on the heart, and thus, represents an important target for therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is involved in the regulation of body weight, likely by hydrolysing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and apelin in the hypothalamus and in the periphery. A link between PRCP protein concentrations in plasma and metabolic disorders has been reported. In this study, we investigated the distribution of circulating PRCP activity and assessed its relation with body weight and adipose tissue in obese patients and patients who significantly lost weight.</AbstractText>: Prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is involved in the regulation of body weight, likely by hydrolysing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and apelin in the hypothalamus and in the periphery.

<p>Several changes occur in lipid metabolism during gestation due to hormonal and metabolic changes, which are essential to satisfy the nutritional demands of the maternal-fetal unit development. The gestation shows two distinct periods that begin with fat accumulation, mainly in maternal adipose tissue, and the late phase, characterized by accelerated catabolism, with the increase of fatty acids in the circulation that causes hyperlipidemia, especially the one characterized as hypertriglyceridemia. Maternal hyperlipidemia may be associated with the development of maternal-fetal complications (preterm birth, preeclampsia, vascular complications) and the development of long-term cardiovascular disease. The cardiovascular risk may not only be related to lipoproteins cholesterol content, but also to the number and functionality of circulating lipoprotein particles. This review reports the major changes that occur in lipoprotein metabolism during pregnancy and that are associated with the development of dyslipidemias, lipoprotein atherogenic phenotype, and maternal-fetal unit complications.Diversas mudanças ocorrem no metabolismo lipídico durante a gestação em função das alterações hormonais e metabólicas, que são essenciais para satisfazer a demanda nutricional ocasionada pelo desenvolvimento da unidade feto-placentária. O período da gestação apresenta dois momentos distintos que iniciam com acúmulo de gordura principalmente no tecido adiposo materno, e a fase tardia, caracterizada por catabolismo acelerado, com aumento de ácidos graxos na circulação causando hiperlipidemia, principalmente a aquela caracterizada como hipertrigliceridemia. A hiperlipidemia materna pode estar associada ao desenvolvimento de complicações materno-fetais (parto prematuro, pré-eclâmpsia, complicações vasculares) e de doenças cardiovasculares, a longo prazo. O risco pode estar relacionado não apenas ao teor de colesterol contido nas frações lipoprotéicas, mas também ao número e a funcionalidade das partículas lipoproteicas. Esta revisão aborda as principais mudanças que ocorrem no metabolismo lipoproteico durante a gravidez, e que estão associadas ao desenvolvimento de dislipidemias, fenótipo aterogênico e complicações materno-fetais.</p>

<p>AIMS: The rejuvenation properties of nanofat grafting have been described in recent years. However, it is not clear whether the clinical efficacy of the procedure is attributable to stem cells or linked to other components of adipose tissue. In this study we isolated nanofat-derived stem cells (NFSCs) to observe their biological characteristics and evaluate the efficacy of precise intradermal injection of nanofat combined with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) in patients undergoing facial rejuvenation treatment.METHODS: Third-passage NFSCs were isolated and cultured using a mechanical emulsification method and their surface CD markers were analyzed by flow cytometry. The adipogenic and osteogenic nature and chondrogenic differentiation capacity of NFSCs were determined using Oil Red O staining, alizarin red staining, and Alcian blue staining, respectively. Paracrine function of NFSCs was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after establishing the culture. Then, the effects of PRF on NFSC proliferation were assessed in vitro. Finally, we compared the outcome in 103 patients with facial skin aging who underwent both nanofat and intradermal PRF injection (treatment group) and 128 patients who underwent hyaluronic acid (HA) injection treatment (control group). Outcomes in the two groups were compared by assessing pictures taken at the same angle before and after treatment, postoperative recovery, incidence of local absorption and cysts, and skin quality before treatment, and at 1, 12, 24 months after treatment using the VISIA Skin Image Analyzer and a SOFT5.5 skin test instrument.RESULTS: NFSCs expressed CD29, CD44, CD49d, CD73, CD90, and CD105, but did not express CD34, CD45, and CD106. NFSCs also differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes under appropriate induction conditions. NFSCs released large amounts of growth factors such as VEGF, bFGF, EGF, and others, and growth factor levels increased in a time-dependent manner. At the same time, PRF enhanced proliferation of NFSCs in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, and the growth curves under different concentrations of PRF all showed plateaus 6d after seeding. Facial skin texture was improved to a greater extent after combined injection of nanofat and PRF than after control injection of HA. The nanofat-PRF group had a higher satisfaction rate. Neither treatment caused any complications such as infection, anaphylaxis, or paresthesia during long-term follow-up.CONCLUSION: NFSCs demonstrate excellent multipotential differentiation and paracrine function, and PRF promotes proliferation of NFSCs during the early stage after seeding. Both nanofat-PRF and HA injection improve facial skin status without serious complications, but the former was associated with greater patient satisfaction, implying that nanofat-PRF injection is a safe, highly effective, and long-lasting method for skin rejuvenation.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue fibrosis is associated with inflammation and insulin resistance in human obesity. In particular, visceral fat fibrosis is correlated with hyperlipidemia and ectopic fat accumulation. Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA) is an important coactivator that mediates the transcription of extracellular matrix and other fibrogenic genes. Here, we examine the role of MRTFA in the development of adipose tissue fibrosis and identify a signaling pathway that regulates the fate of vascular progenitors. We demonstrate that obesity induces the formation of Sca1<sup>-</sup>, Sma<sup>+</sup>, ITGA5<sup>+</sup> fibrogenic progenitor cells (FPCs) in adipose tissue. MRTFA deficiency in mice shifts the fate of perivascular progenitors from FPCs to adipocyte precursor cells and protects against chronic obesity-induced fibrosis and accompanying metabolic dysfunction, without a shift in energy expenditure. Our findings highlight the ITGA5-MRTFA pathway as a potential target to ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic disease.</p>

<p>Ex vivo nonviral gene delivery of bone inductive factors has the potential to heal bone defects. Due to their inherent role in new bone formation, multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) have been studied as the primary target cell for gene delivery in a preclinical setting. The relative contribution of autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, and the need of osteogenic cells, remains unclear. This study investigates the contribution of MSCs as producer of transgenic bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and to what extent the seeded MSCs participate in actual osteogenesis. Rat-derived MSCs or fibroblasts (FBs) were cotransfected with pBMP-2 and pBMP-6 or pBMP-7 via nucleofection. The bioactivity of BMP products was shown through in vitro osteogenic differentiation assays. To investigate their role in new bone formation, transfected cells were seeded on ceramic scaffolds and implanted subcutaneously in rats. Bone formation was assessed by histomorphometry after 8 weeks. As a proof of principle, we also investigated the suitability of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and the stromal vascular fraction isolated from adipose tissue for a one-stage gene delivery strategy. Bone formation was induced in all conditions containing cells overexpressing BMP heterodimers. Constructs seeded with FBs transfected with BMP-2/6 and MSCs transfected with BMP-2/6 showed comparable bone volumes, both significantly higher than controls. Single-stage gene delivery proved possible and resulted in some bone formation. We conclude that bone formation as a result of ex vivo BMP gene delivery can be achieved even without direct osteogenic potential of the transfected cell type, suggesting that transfected cells mainly function as a production facility for osteoinductive proteins. In addition, single-stage transfection and reimplantation of cells appeared feasible, thus facilitating future clinical translation of the method.</p>

<p>Most common forms of hair loss (alopecia) are caused by aberrant hair follicle cycling and changes in hair follicle morphology. However, current treatments for alopecia do not specifically target these processes. Adipose-derived stromal vascular cells (ADSVCs) that can be harvested from fat cells are one of the latest breakthroughs in the aesthetic field. The potential use of stem cell-based therapies (SCBT) for the repair and regeneration of various tissues and organs offers a paradigm shift that may provide alternative therapeutic solutions, which can be applied to prevent hair loss. This study aimed to present clinical cases of SCBT for the treatment of alopecia areata by transplantation of ADSVCs in the scalp.</AbstractText>: Most common forms of hair loss (alopecia) are caused by aberrant hair follicle cycling and changes in hair follicle morphology.

<p>The seeding of tissue constructs with adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments (ad-MVF) is an emerging pre-vascularisation strategy. Ad-MVF rapidly reassemble into new microvascular networks after in vivo implantation. Herein it was analysed whether this process was improved by erythropoietin (EPO). Ad-MVF were isolated from green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ as well as wild-type C57BL/6 mice and cultivated for 24 h in medium supplemented with EPO (20 IU/mL) or vehicle. Freshly isolated, non-cultivated ad-MVF served as controls. Protein expression, cell viability and proliferation of ad-MVF were assessed by proteome profiler array and fluorescence microscopy. GFP+ ad-MVF were seeded on collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices, which were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of C57BL/6 mice, to analyse their vascularisation over 14 d by intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry. Cultivation up-regulated the expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors within both vehicle- and EPO-treated ad-MVF when compared with non-cultivated controls. Moreover, EPO treatment suppressed cultivation-associated apoptosis and significantly increased the number of proliferating endothelial cells in ad-MVF when compared with vehicle-treated and non-cultivated ad-MVF. Accordingly, implanted matrices seeded with EPO-treated ad-MVF exhibited an improved vascularisation, as indicated by a significantly higher functional microvessel density. The matrices of the three groups contained a comparably large fraction of GFP+ microvessels originating from the ad-MVF, whereas the tissue surrounding the matrices seeded with EPO-treated ad-MVF exhibited a significantly increased microvessel density when compared with the other two groups. These findings indicated that EPO represents a promising cytokine to further boost the excellent vascularisation properties of ad-MVF in tissue-engineering applications.</p>

<p>The objective of this Review is to describe the safety and efficacy of adipose stem/stromal cells (ASC) and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in treating common diseases and the next steps in research that must occur prior to clinical use. Pubmed, Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles about use of SVF or ASC for disease therapy published between 2012 and 2017. One meta-analysis, 2 randomized controlled trials, and 16 case series were included, representing 844 human patients. Sixty-nine studies were performed in preclinical models of disease. ASCs improved symptoms, fistula healing, remission, and recurrence rates in severe cases of inflammatory bowel disease. In osteoarthritis, ASC and SVF improved symptom-related, functional, radiographic, and histological scores. ASC and SVF were also shown to improve clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, myocardial ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic liver failure, glioblastoma, acute kidney injury, and chronic skin wounds. These effects were primarily paracrine in nature and mediated through reduction of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair. In the majority of human studies, autologous ASC and SVF from liposuction procedures were used, minimizing the risk to recipients. Very few serious, treatment-related adverse events were reported. The main adverse event was postprocedural pain. SVF and ASC are promising therapies for a variety of human diseases, particularly for patients with severe cases refractory to current medical treatments. Further randomized controlled trials must be performed to elaborate potential safety and efficacy prior to clinical use. Stem Cells 2018;36:1311-1328.</p>

<p>During several anesthesiological procedures, needles are inserted through the skin of a patient to target nerves. In most cases, the needle traverses several tissues-skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels-to reach the target nerve. A clear identification of the target nerve can improve the success of the nerve block and reduce the rate of complications. This may be accomplished with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) which can provide a quantitative measure of the tissue composition. The goal of the current study was to further explore the morphological, biological, chemical, and optical characteristics of the tissues encountered during needle insertion to improve future DRS classification algorithms.</AbstractText>: During several anesthesiological procedures, needles are inserted through the skin of a patient to target nerves.

<p>Various imperative studies support the notion that hyperinsulinemia (HI) itself serves as the common link between adipose tissue inflammation (ATI) and metabolic syndrome. However, the contribution of HI mediated ATI and its metabolic consequences are yet to be explored. We induced chronic HI per se in mice by administration of exogenous insulin for 8 weeks through mini-osmotic pumps. For the reduction of circulating insulin in response to excess calorie intake, we have partially ablated ß-cells by using streptozotocin (STZ) in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) and genetic mice models (db/db). Flow cytometry analysis was performed for the quantification of immune cells in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Our studies demonstrated that chronic HI augmented ATI in terms of elevated pro-inflammatory cells (M1 macrophages and NK-cells) and suppressed anti-inflammatory cells (M2 macrophages, eosinophils and regulatory T-cells). These results were correlated with altered obesity-associated metabolic phenotype. Partial reduction of circulating insulin level attenuated excess calorie-induced ATI and improved insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, an imbalance in M1 and M2 macrophage proportions in eWAT promoted iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase): arginase-1 imbalance that resulted into extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and insulin resistance (IR) development. However, iNOS<sup>-/-</sup> mice were protected from HI-induced M1:M2 macrophage imbalance, ECM deposition and IR in adipose tissue. Overall, we conclude that chronic HI per se contributed in ATI and iNOS corroborated ECM deposition.</p>

<p>Adiponectin (APN), an adipose tissue-excreted adipokine, plays protective roles in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, the effects and mechanisms of APN on biological functions of rat vascular endothelial progenitor cells (VEPCs) were investigated in vitro. After administrating APN in rat VEPCs, the proliferation was measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method, the apoptotic rate was test by Flow cytometry assay, mRNA expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein expression of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) was analyzed by Western blot. It was suggested that APN promoted the optical density (OD) value of VEPCs, enhanced mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and VEGF, and inhibited cell apoptotic rate. Furthermore, protein expression of pSTAT3 was also increased in the presence of APN. Moreover, APN changed-proliferation, apoptosis and VEGF expression of VEPCs were partially suppressed after blocking the mTOR-STAT3 signaling pathway by the mTOR inhibitor XL388. It was indicated that APN promoted biological functions of VEPCs through targeting the mTOR-STAT3 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>The improvement of fat graft viability might depend on the presence of multipotent resident adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) which is the important component of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenin-1 (Ang-1) are responsible for neovascularization. However, their half-life is too short to produce a biological effect. We thus investigated whether VEGF-ANG-1-polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres could enhance the angiogenic properties of ADSCs. PLA microspheres containing VEGF and ANG-1 were prepared by in vitro ultrasonic emulsification and characterized according to their encapsulation efficiency (EE), drug-loading rate (DL), particle size, and drug release. The systemic toxicity of empty loaded nanospheres (NPs) and the ability of these microspheres to promote the proliferation and differentiation of ADSCs were evaluated. The EE and DL were above 86% and 0.0288%, respectively [corrected].The drug release was completed after 20 days. Systemic toxicity was verified in ADSCs that received the unloaded NPs. It was observed that ADSCs treated with VEGF-ANG-1-PLA microspheres had an increase in the proliferation and the number of CD31 positive cells. ADSCs proliferation and differentiation toward endothelial cells (ECs) could be enhanced by the addition of VEGF-ANG-1-PLA nano-sustained release microspheres.</p>

<p>Red wine polyphenol extracts improve cardiovascular and metabolic disorders linked to obesity. Their vascular protection is mediated by the activation of the alpha isoform of the estrogen receptor (ERa). In the present study, we explored the effects of a grape seed extract (GSE) enriched in the flavan-3-ols procyanidin dimers on obesity-related cardiovascular and metabolic disorders; with a particular interest in the role/contribution of ERa. Ovariectomized wild type or ERa knockout (KO) mice were fed with standard or western diet, supplemented or not with GSE, for 12 weeks. Their body weight was monitored throughout the study, and an echocardiography was performed at the end of the treatment. Blood and tissues were collected for biochemical and functional analysis, including nitric oxide and oxidative stress measurement. Vascular reactivity and liver mitochondrial complexes activity were also analyzed. In western diet-fed mice, GSE reduced adiposity, plasma triglycerides, and oxidative stress in the heart, liver, adipose and skeletal tissues; but did not improve the vascular dysfunction. In western diet-fed mice, ERa deletion prevented or reduced the beneficial effects of GSE on plasma triglycerides and visceral adiposity. ERa deletion also prevented/reduced the anti-oxidant effect of GSE in the liver, but did not affect its capacity to reduce oxidative stress in the heart and adipose tissue. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of GSE attenuated features of metabolic syndrome partially through ERa-dependent mechanisms. This report highlights the therapeutic potential of polyphenols, and especially extract enriched in procyanidin dimers, against the metabolic disorders associated with excessive energy intake.</p>

<p>Human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue consists of two individual layers&amp;mdash;the superficial adipose tissue (SAT) and deep adipose tissue (DAT)&amp;mdash;separated by the Scarpa&amp;rsquo;s fascia. The present study focuses on the analysis of morphological and immunological differences of primary adipocytes, adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), and tissue-infiltrating immune cells found in SAT and DAT. Adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were isolated from human SAT and DAT specimens and phenotypically characterized by in vitro assays. Ex vivo analysis of infiltrating immune cells was performed by flow cytometry. Primary adipocytes from SAT are larger in size but did not significantly differ in cytokine levels of LEPTIN, ADIPOQ, RBP4, CHEMERIN, DEFB1, VISFATIN, MCP1, or MSCF. ASC isolated from SAT proliferated faster and exhibited a higher differentiation potential than those isolated from DAT. Flow cytometry analysis indicated no specific differences in the relative numbers of ASC, epithelial progenitor cells (EPC), or CD3<U+207A> T-cells, but showed higher numbers of tissue-infiltrating macrophages in SAT compared to DAT. Our findings suggest that ASC isolated from SAT have a higher regenerative potential than DAT-ASC. Moreover, spatial proximity to skin microbiota might promote macrophage infiltration in SAT.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) may transdifferentiate into cells belonging to mesodermal, endodermal, and ectodermal lineages. The aim of this study was to verify whether a neural differentiation of ASCs could be induced by a conditioned medium (CM) obtained from cultures of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) or Schwann cells (SCs). ASCs were isolated from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue and expanded for 2-3 passages. They were then cultured in OEC-CM or SC-CM for 24<U+2009>hr or 7 days. At each stage, the cells were tested by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometer analysis to evaluate the expression of typical neural markers such as Nestin, PGP 9.5, MAP2, Synapsin I, and GFAP. Results show that both conditioned media induced similar positive effects, as all tested markers were overexpressed, especially at day 7. Overall, an evident trend toward neuronal or glial differentiation was not clearly detectable in many cases. Nevertheless, a higher tendency toward a neuronal phenotype was recognized for OEC-CM (considering MAP2 increases). On the other hand, SC-CM would be responsible for a more marked glial induction (considering GFAP increases). These findings confirm that environmental features can induce ASCs toward a neural differentiation, either as neuronal or glial elements. Rather than supplementing the culture medium by adding chemical agents, a “more physiological” condition was obtained here by means of soluble factors (cytokines/growth factors) likely released by glial cells. This culture strategy may provide valuable information in the development of cell-based therapeutic approaches for pathologies affecting the central/peripheral nervous system.</p>

During the last two decades, it has been shown that PVAT may modulate vascular reactivity. It has also been previously demonstrated that inflammation in adipose tissue may be implicated in vascular dysfunction. In particular, adipocytes secrete a number of adipokines with various functions, as well as several vasoactive factors, together with components of the renin-angiotensin system which may act at local or at systemic level. It has been shown that the anti-contractile effect of PVAT is lost in obesity, probably as a consequence of the development of adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Adipose tissue dysfunction is interrelated with inflammation and oxidative stress, thus contributing to endothelial dysfunction observed in several pathological and clinical conditions such as obesity and hypertension. Decreased local adiponectin level, macrophage recruitment and infiltration, and activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system could play an important role in this regard.</AbstractText>: PVAT possesses a relevant endocrine-paracrine activity, which may be altered in several pathophysiological and clinical conditions.

<p>The injection of mesenchymal stem cells into the injured myocardium to induce cardiac regeneration has yielded disappointing results, conceivably because cells with cardioreparative potential must be supplied for long periods of time to produce a salutary effect. Accordingly, investigators have devised ways of directing such cells to the heart on an ongoing basis: by enhancing the action of endogenous peptides that function as cardiac homing signals (eg, stromal cell-derived factor-1). Stromal cell-derived factor-1 is released during acute cardiac injury and heart failure, but it has a short half-life because of degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 potentiates the actions of stromal cell-derived factor-1 and, theoretically, could enhance cardiac recovery. However, in large-scale trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have not reduced the risk of atherosclerotic ischemic events, and they have unexpectedly increased the risk of heart failure, most probably heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. Such an outcome might be explained if the channeling of mesenchymal stem cells to the heart by the actions of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (especially from nearby adipose tissue) were followed by the transformation of these cells into fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. This concern has been supported by experimental studies; the resulting fibrosis would be expected to exacerbate the pathophysiological derangements that lead to heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. Given the widespread use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, the possibility that these drugs potentiate the cardiac homing of mesenchymal stem cells that cause myocardial fibrosis (rather than repair) warrants further study.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is inevitable during free tissue transfers. When the period of ischemia exceeds the tissue tolerance, it causes necrosis and flap failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) embedded in a collagen type I scaffold on the survival of free skin flaps to counteract I/R injury.METHODS: Left superficial caudal epigastric skin flaps (3<U+2009>×<U+2009>6 cm) were performed in 28 Wistar rats that were divided into four groups. The flaps elevated in the animals of the control group did not suffer any ischemic insult, and the vascular pedicle was not cut. All other flaps were subjected to 8 hours of ischemia prior to revascularization: I/R control group (8 hours of ischemia), I/R scaffold group (8 hours of ischemia<U+2009>+<U+2009>collagen type I scaffold), and I/R scaffold-ASCs group (8 hours of ischemia<U+2009>+<U+2009>collagen type I scaffold with rat ASCs embedded). Transit-time ultrasound blood flow measurements were performed. After 7 days, the areas of flap survival were measured and tissues were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and Masson’s trichrome stain for histological analysis.RESULTS: The mean percentage flap survival area was significantly higher in the ASCs-treated flaps (I/R scaffold-ASCs group) compared with the ischemic controls (I/R control group and I/R scaffold group). Higher vascular proliferation and lower severity of necrosis and inflammatory changes were seen histologically in the samples of the ASCs-treated group. No significant difference in blood flow was detected between groups.CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous administration of ASCs embedded on a collagen type I scaffold reduces tissue damage after I/R injury in microvascular free flaps.</p>

<p>The indigestible mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) derived from the outer cell wall of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown potential to reduce inflammation. Since inflammation is one of the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunctions, we aimed to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with MOS on inflammation and metabolic homeostasis in lean and diet-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a low fat diet (LFD) or a high fat diet (HFD) with, respectively, 10% or 45% energy derived from lard fat, with or without 1% MOS for 17 weeks. Body weight and composition were measured throughout the study. After 12 weeks of intervention, whole-body glucose tolerance was assessed and in week 17 immune cell composition was determined in mesenteric white adipose tissue (mWAT) and liver by flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. In LFD-fed mice, MOS supplementation induced a significant increase in the abundance of macrophages and eosinophils in mWAT. A similar trend was observed in hepatic macrophages. Although HFD feeding induced a classical shift from the anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages towards the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages in both mWAT and liver from control mice, MOS supplementation had no effect on this obesity-driven immune response. Finally, MOS supplementation did not improve whole-body glucose homeostasis in both lean and obese mice.Altogether, our data showed that MOS had extra-intestinal immune modulatory properties in mWAT and liver. However these effects were not substantial enough to significantly ameliorate HFD-induced glucose intolerance or inflammation.</p>

<p>Joint conditions incapacitate free movement driving to a sedentary lifestyle, a major risk factor for chronic diseases. Regenerative procedures, involving the use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells along with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), can help patients with these conditions. We describe the main characteristics of cellular products (bone marrow concentrate, stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells derived from these tissues), and the potential benefits of combination with PRP in 3 scenarios: PRP lysates used during laboratory cell expansion; PRP to prime cellular products or the host tissue before cell implantation; PRP used as a vehicle for cell transplantation and to provide trophic signals. Clinical studies exploring the benefits of combination products are limited to case series and few controlled studies, involving either arthroscopy or percutaneous injections. Combination products are making their way to clinics but further experimental and clinical research is needed to establish protocols and indications.</p>

<p>One of the essential goals in regenerative medicine is microvascularization which enables an effective blood supply within de novo constructed tissues and organs. In our study, we used two common multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell (MMSC) sources (subcutaneous adipose tissue and Wharton’s jelly of the umbilical cord) where is a subpopulation of endothelial precursors. In the medium supplemented with VEGF, the 3D cultures of UC MMSCs and ADSCs promoted the endothelial cell differentiation. To evaluate their ability to form a capillary-like network, we encapsulated spheroids within non-modified and PEGylated fibrin hydrogels. The PEGylated hydrogel supported better the formation of multibranched cords than the pure fibrin gel. Analysis of tubule growth rate, length, and branching showed that the differentiated ADSCs had higher angiogenic potential than the differentiated hUC MMSCs. Our study can be a basis for the development of new strategies in tissue engineering and treatment of vascular diseases.</p>

<p>Functional perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is necessary to maintain vascular physiology through both mechanical support and endocrine or paracrine ways. PVAT shows a brown adipose tissue (BAT)-like feature and the browning level of PVAT is dependent on the anatomic location and species. However, it is not clear whether PVAT browning is involved in the vascular tone regulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In the present study, we aimed to illustrate the effect of aging on PVAT browning and subsequent vasomotor reaction in SHRs. Herein we utilized histological staining and western blot to detect the characteristics of thoracic PVAT (tPVAT) in 8-week-old and 16-week-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We also detected vascular reactivity analysis to determine the effect of tPVAT on vasomotor reaction during aging. The results showed that tPVAT had a similar phenotype to BAT, including smaller adipocyte size and positive uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) staining. Interestingly, the tPVAT of 8-week-old SHR showed increased BAT phenotypic marker expression compared to WKY, whereas the browning level of tPVAT had a more dramatic decrease from 8 to 16 weeks of age in SHR than age-matched WKY rats. The vasodilation effect of tPVAT on aortas had no significant difference in 8-week-old WKY and SHR, whereas this effect is obviously decreased in 16-week-old SHR compared to WKY. In contrast, tPVAT showed a similar vasoconstriction effect in 8- or 16-week-old WKY and SHR rats. Moreover, we identified an important vasodilator adenosine, which regulates adipocyte browning and may be a potential PVAT-derived relaxing factor. Adenosine is dramatically decreased from 8 to 16 weeks of age in the tPVAT of SHR. In summary, aging is associated with a decrease of tPVAT browning and adenosine production in SHR rats. These may result in attenuated vasodilation effect of the tPVAT in SHR during aging.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) in the clinical setting.METHODS: A literature search was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library Database up to January 2017 for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Criteria for inclusion were clinical studies demonstrating the effects of ADSCs on OA, and written in English. The following variables were analyzed: donor site, volume of adipose tissue, preparation of ADSCs, clinical outcomes, and complication rate.RESULTS: Sixteen studies (knee: 14 studies, multiple joints: 1 study, ankle: 1 study) were included in this systematic review. All of the studies prepared ADSCs in the form of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Inconsistencies between studies were found with regards to reported clinical variability, donor sites of SVF, and reported clinical outcomes. Nine studies used either platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (7/16) or fibrin (4/16) or both PRP and Fibrin (1/16), as an adjunct at time of SVF injection. All of the studies reported an improvement in clinical outcomes with the use of SVF. Five studies reported a 90% satisfaction rate, and no study reported any complications with liposuction. Five studies reported on complications, with a 5% incidence of swelling and pain.CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrated that ADSCs are currently used in the form of SVF. While SVF may produce favorable clinical outcomes with minimal risk of side effects on osteoarthritis, the variability in the data and the use of biological adjuvants have confounded the effectiveness of ADSCs. This study will help surgeons understand the limitations in the literature on ADSCs.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of level IV studies.</p>

<p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic hormone with pleiotropic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, the role of FGF21 in hypertension remains elusive. Here we show that FGF21 deficiency significantly exacerbates angiotensin II-induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction, whereas such negative effects are reversed by replenishment of FGF21. Mechanistically, FGF21 acts on adipocytes and renal cells to promote induction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which in turn converts angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7), then inhibits hypertension and reverses vascular damage. In addition, ACE2 deficiency strikingly abrogates these beneficial effects of FGF21 in mice, including alleviation of angiotensin II-associated hypertension and vascular damage. Otherwise, pharmaceutical inhibition of angiotensin-(1-7) attenuates the protective effect of FGF21 on angiotensin II-induced vascular dysfunction, but not on hypertension. Thus, FGF21 protects against angiotensin II-induced hypertension and vascular impairment by activation of the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7) axis via fine-tuning the multi-organ crosstalk between liver, adipose tissue, kidney, and blood vessels.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been demonstrated to promote cerebral vascular remodeling processes after stroke. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which ADSCs exert protective roles in ischemic stroke is still poorly understood. In this study, we identified the role of exosomal microRNA-181b-5p (181b-Exos) in regulating post-stroke angiogenesis. The results of migration assay and capillary network formation assay showed that exosomes secreted by ADSCs (ADSCs-Exos) promoted the mobility and angiogenesis of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that microRNA-212-5p (miR-212-5p) and miR-181b-5p were upregulated in BMECs subjected to the brain extract of the middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. The migration distance and tube length were increased in BMECs cultured with 181b-Exos. Furthermore, we identified that transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) was a direct target of miR-181b-5p. TRPM7 mRNA and protein levels were declined in BMECs cultured with 181b-Exos, but not in BMECs cultured with 212-Exos. Overexpression of TRPM7 reversed the effects of 181b-Exos on migration and tube formation of BMECs. In addition, 181b-Exos upregulated the protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, and downregulated the protein expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3. The regulatory effect of 181b-Exos was attenuated by overexpressing TRPM7. Altogether, ADSCs-Exos promote the angiogenesis of BMECs after OGD via miR-181b-5p/TRPM7 axis, suggesting that ADSCs-Exos may represent a novel therapeutic approach for stroke recovery.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) is associated with vascular homeostasis; however, its causal effect on atherosclerosis currently remains undefined. Here, we investigated the effect of experimental PAT transplantation on atherosclerosis. The thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (tPAT) was dissected from 16-week-old wild-type mice and transplanted over the infrarenal aorta of 20-week-old apoE deficient (apoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice fed high-cholesterol diet for 3 months. Oil-red O staining after 4 weeks showed a significant 20% decrease in the atherosclerotic lesion of suprarenal aorta compared with that of sham control mice, while that of infrarenal aorta showed no difference between the two groups. TGF-ß1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in grafted tPAT than donor tPAT, accompanied by a significant increase in serum TGF-ß1 concentration, which was inversely correlated with the suprarenal lesion area (r<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.63, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.012). Treatment with neutralizing TGF-ß antibody abrogated the anti-atherogenic effect of tPAT transplantation. Immunofluorescent analysis of grafted tPAT showed that TGF-ß-positive cells were co-localized with Mac-2-positive cells and this number was significantly increased compared with donor tPAT. There was also marked increase in mRNA expression of alternatively activated macrophages-related genes. Furthermore, the percentage of eosinophils in stromal vascular fraction of donor tPAT was much higher than that in epididymal white adipose tissue, concomitant with the significantly higher protein level of IL-4. IL-4 mRNA expression levels in grafted tPAT were increased in a time-dependent manner after tPAT transplantation. Our findings show that tPAT transplantation inhibits atherosclerosis development by exerting TGF-ß1-mediated anti-inflammatory response, which may involve alternatively activated macrophages.</p>

<p>For decades, moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) has been the cornerstone of exercise prescription for cardiac rehabilitation (CR). High intensity interval training (HIIT) is now recognized in CR exercise guidelines as an appropriate and efficient modality for improving cardiorespiratory fitness, a strong predictor of mortality. However, the clinical application of HIIT in a real world CR setting, in terms of feasibility, safety, and long-term adherence, needs further investigation to address ongoing reservations. Furthermore, studies using objective measures of exercise intensity (such as heart rate; HR) have produced variable outcomes. Therefore we propose investigating the use of subjective measures (such as rating of perceived exertion (RPE)) for prescribing exercise intensity.</AbstractText>: For decades, moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) has been the cornerstone of exercise prescription for cardiac rehabilitation (CR).

<p>Studies on thermogenic adipose cells (brown and beige fat) hold promise to treat obesity and its associated metabolic disorders due to the ability of these cells to dissipate energy in the form of heat. Although immortalized adipose cell lines have been widely used to investigate cell autonomous regulations, many physiological functions of thermogenic fat need to be studied with primary fat cells. Here, we present a detailed protocol of the isolation, culture, and differentiation of primary brown and beige preadipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction of murine interscapular and inguinal adipose depots.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue provides valuable cell source for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and adipose tissue biology studies. The most widely used adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) isolation protocol involves enzymatic digestion with collagenase. However, the yield of the method is poor even impossible to collect enough stromal vascular fraction (SVF) for expansion when the sample size is small, for instance only new born mice is available for cell culture. Here, we describe an efficient protocol for the isolation and expansion of ASCs using explant culture.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) has attracted interest for tissue engineering and cell-based therapies as an abundant source of adipose stem/stromal cells (ASC). However, technical challenges in WAT cell culture have limited its applications in regenerative medicine. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models, which are essentially monolayers of cells on glass or plastic substrates, inadequately represent tissue architecture, biochemical concentration gradients, substrate stiffness, and most importantly for WAT research, cell phenotypic heterogeneity. Physiological cell culture platforms for WAT modeling must recapitulate the native diversity of cell types and their coordination within the organ. For this purpose, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) model using magnetic levitation. Here, we describe our protocol that we successfully employed to build adipose tissue organoids (adipospheres) that preserve the heterogeneity of the constituent cell types in vitro. We demonstrate the capacity of assembling adipospheres from multiple cell types, including ASCs, endohtelial cells, and leukocytes that recreate tissue organization. These adipospheres mimicked WAT organogenesis in that they enabled the formation of vessel-like endothelial structures with lumens and differentiation of unilocular adipocytes. Altogether, magnetic levitation is a cell culture platform that recreates tissue structure, function, and heterogeneity in vitro, and serves as a foundation for high-throughput WAT tissue culture and analysis.</p>

<p>Murine models of obesity or reduced adiposity are a valuable resource for understanding the role of adipocyte dysfunction in metabolic disorders. Adipose tissue stromal vascular cells or primary adipocytes derived from murine adipose tissue and grown in culture are essential tools for studying the mechanisms underlying adipocyte development and function. Herein, we describe methods for the isolation, expansion, and long-term storage of murine adipose-derived stromal/stem cells along with protocols for inducing adipogenesis in this cell population or isolating the adipose stromal vascular fraction cells for flow cytometric analysis.</p>

<p>Cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine offer a paradigm shift in regard to various diseases causing loss of substance or volume and tissue or organ damage. Recently, many authors have focused their attention on mesenchymal stem cells for their capacity to differentiate into many cell lineages. The most widely studied types are bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), which display similar results. Based on the literature, we believe that the ADSCs offer advantages because of lower morbidity during the harvesting procedure. Additionally, platelet-rich plasma can be used in this field for its ability to stimulate tissue regeneration. The aim of this chapter is to describe ADSC preparation and isolation procedures, preparation of platelet-rich plasma, and the application of ADSCs in regenerative plastic surgery. We also discuss the mechanisms and future role of ADSCs in cell-based therapy and tissue engineering.</p>

<p>Evidence from preclinical research and clinical trials demonstrates the use of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) as therapy for numerous indications. These results demonstrate that autologous SVF is not only safe and effective but provides robust anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and reparative effects in vivo. The potency of the SVF is attributed to the cellular composition which includes adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), adipocytes, endothelial cells, and various immune cells. As the name would suggest, these SVF cells are derived from the stromal compartment of adipose, or fat. Once digested, the cells that constitute adipose are released and collected as the SVF. The cellular frequencies within the SVF can then be assessed using a fluorescent antibody-based technique known as flow cytometry. The following chapter provides a standard operating protocol that describes the procedures from harvesting the fat tissue from experimental mice to isolating and characterizing the SVF.</p>

<p>Obesity is a global health problem with an up-regulated inflammatory reaction. Obesity-induced endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) dysfunction is associated with vascular complications that may contribute to critical limb ischemia. Arginine (Arg) is an amino acid with immune-modulatory property and has been found to promote EPCs mobilization in disease conditions. Thus in the present investigation, we hypothesized that arginine given to a murine model of diet-induced obesity would increase circulating EPCs and mitigate the inflammatory reactions in response to limb ischemia. Mice were divided into normal group (NC), high-fat group (HC), and high-fat Arg group (HA). Mice in the HC group were fed with a diet containing 60% energy as fat for 8 weeks, while HA group were initially fed with the same high-fat diet for 4 weeks and later shifted to a high-fat diet enriched with 2% Arg for the remaining 4 weeks. Then mice in the HC and HA groups underwent ischemic operations and were euthanized at either day 1 or day 7 after limb ischemia. The results showed that, compared to the ischemic HC group, the ischemic HA group had higher circulating EPCs at day 1 post-ischemia and higher muscle stromal cell-derived factor-1 and interleukin (IL)-10 mRNA expressions at day 7 after ischemia. In contrast, plasma leptin concentration and expressions of IL-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-a mRNAs by adipocytes were down-regulated. These findings suggest that obese mice treated with Arg-containing high-fat diet enhanced circulating EPCs percentage and attenuated inflammatory reaction in response to limb ischemia.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a new automatic classification algorithm to identify voxels containing skin, vasculature, adipose, and fibroglandular tissue in dedicated breast CT images.METHODS: The proposed algorithm combines intensity- and region-based segmentation methods with energy minimizing splines and unsupervised data mining approaches for classifying and segmenting the different tissue types. Breast skin segmentation is achieved by a region-growing method which uses constraints from the previously extracted skin centerline to add robustness to the model and to reduce the false positive rate. An energy minimizing active contour model is then used to classify adipose tissue voxels by including gradient flow and region-based features. Finally, blood vessels are separated from fibroglandular tissue by a k-means clustering algorithm based on automatically extracted shape-based features. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, two sets of 15 different patient breast CT scans, each acquired with different breast CT systems and acquisition settings were obtained. Three slices from each scan were manually segmented under the supervision of an experienced breast radiologist and considered the gold standard. Comparisons with manual segmentation were quantified using five similarity metrics: Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, conformity coefficient, and two Hausdorff distance measures. To evaluate the robustness to image noise, the segmentation was repeated after separately adding Gaussian noise with increasing standard deviation (in four steps, from 0.01 to 0.04) to an additional 15 slices from the first dataset. In addition, to evaluate vasculature classification, three different pre- and postcontrast injection patient breast CT images were classified and compared. Finally, DSC was also used for quantitative comparisons with previously proposed approaches for breast CT tissue classification using 10 images from the first dataset.RESULTS: The algorithm showed a high accuracy in classifying the different tissue types for both breast CT systems, with an average DSC of 95% and 90% for the first and second image dataset, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrated to be robust to image noise with a robustness to image noise of 85%, 83%, 79%, and 71% for the images corrupted with the four increasing noise levels. Previous methods for breast tissues classification resulted, for the tested dataset, in an average global DSC of 87%, while our approach resulted in a global average DSC of 94.5%.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm resulted in accurate and robust breast tissue classification, with no prior training or threshold setting. Potential applications include breast density quantification and tissue pattern characterization (both biomarkers of cancer development), simulation-based radiation dose analysis, and patient data-based phantom design, which could be used for further breast imaging research.</p>

<p>Endothelial dysfunction is caused by many factors, such as dyslipidemia, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inflammation. It has been demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is the initial process of atherosclerosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important metabolic switch that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. However, recent evidence indicates that AMPK could be a target for atherosclerosis by improving endothelial function. For instance, activation of AMPK inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species induced by mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and NADPH oxidase. Moreover, activation of AMPK inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory factors induced by dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia and restrains production of perivascular adipose tissue-released adipokines. AMPK activation prevents endothelial dysfunction by increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Therefore, we focused on the primary risk factors involved in endothelial dysfunction, and summarize the features of AMPK in the protection of endothelial function, by providing signaling pathways thought to be important in the pathological progress of risk factors.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects of abdominal obesity (AO) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with or without AO on carotid arteries by determining carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT).METHODS: A total of 2745 Chinese Han adults (aged between 40 and 50 years old) were recruited and divided into 4 groups: (1) NW-no NAFL group: the normal body weight without NAFLD (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1888); (2) AO-no NAFL group: AO without NAFLD (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>259); (3) NW-with NAFL group: NAFLD without AO (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>93); and (4) AO-with NAFL group: AO with NAFLD (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>505). The CIMT rate of each group was compared among 4 groups and the regression analysis was further used to correct confounders.RESULTS: We found that the NW-with NAFL group had a significantly higher CIMT rate than the AO-no NAFL group ([.87<U+2009>±<U+2009>.31] versus [.72<U+2009>±<U+2009>.29] P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.01) and the AO-with NAFL group ([.87<U+2009>±<U+2009>.31] versus [.79<U+2009>±<U+2009>.26], P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.01).CONCLUSIONS: The ectopic liver fat accumulation may increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Therefore, screening NAFLD in the population with normal weight may be beneficial for the prevention of atherosclerosis at an early stage.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells are already used in numerous areas of medicine. In the field of plastic surgery, the main focus of recent research has been to utilise adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs), mainly harvested via liposuction. The ability to release regenerative cytokines is supposed to be the key mechanism for the therapeutic efficacy of ASCs. There are currently a variety of methods and devices in clinical use for harvesting lipoaspirate and consequently ASCs. For most of these devices, the effect on the regenerative cytokine profile of ASCs is unknown. The aim of this study is to compare the expression of key regenerative cytokines of ASCs derived by three standard procedures of plastic surgery: abdominoplasty, suction-assisted liposuction (SAL) and ultrasound-assisted liposuction (UAL).</AbstractText>: Mesenchymal stem cells are already used in numerous areas of medicine.

We tested the hypothesis that PVAT contributed to plaque vulnerability and investigated whether endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) in PVAT played an important role in vulnerable plaque.We transplanted thoracic aortic PVAT or subcutaneous adipose tissue as a control, from donor mice to carotid arteries of recipient apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice after removing carotid artery collar placed for 6 weeks. Two weeks after transplantation, ER stress inhibitor 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) was locally administrated to the transplanted PVAT and then animals were euthanized after 4 weeks. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify plaque composition and neovascularization.

In vitro tube formation assay, scratch wound migration assay and mouse aortic ring assay were used to assess the angiogenic capacity of supernatant of transplanted PVAT.Ultrastructural detection by transmission electron microscopy showed transplanted PVAT was a mixed population of white and brown adipocytes with abundant mitochondria. Transplanted PVAT increased the intraplaque macrophage infiltration, lipid core, intimal and vasa vasorum neovascularization and MMP2/9 expression in plaque while decreased smooth muscle cells and collagen in atherosclerotic plaque, which were restored by local 4-PBA-treatment. Antibody array analysis showed that 4-PBA reduced several angiogenic factors [Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), MCP-1, IL-6] secreted by PVAT. Besides, conditioned medium from 4-PBA treated-PVAT inhibited tube formation and migration capacity of endothelial cells and ex vivo mouse aortic ring angiogenesis compared to conditioned medium from transplanted PVAT. mRNA expression and protein levels of GM-CSF were markedly elevated in adipocytes under ER stress which would be suppressed by 4-PBA.

<p>Adipose tissue contains a heterogeneous population of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells that work synergistically with resident cell types to enhance tissue healing. Ease of access and processing paired with therapeutic promise make SVF cells an attractive option for autologous applications in regenerative medicine. However, inherent variability in SVF cell therapeutic potential from one patient to another hinders prognosis determination for any one person. This study investigated the regenerative properties and inflammation responses of thirteen, medically diverse human donors. Using non-expanded primary lipoaspirate samples, SVF cells were assessed for robustness of several parameters integral to tissue regeneration, including yield, viability, self-renewal capacity, proliferation, differentiation potential, and immunomodulatory cytokine secretion. Each parameter was selected either for its role in regenerative potential, defined here as the ability to heal tissues through stem cell repopulation and subsequent multipotent differentiation, or for its potential role in wound healing through trophic immunomodulatory activity. These data were then analyzed for consistent and predictable patterns between and across measurements, while also investigating the influence of the donors’ relevant medical histories, particularly if the donor was in remission following breast cancer treatment. Analyses identified positive correlations among the expression of three cytokines: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. The expression of these cytokines also positively related to self-renewal capacity. These results are potentially relevant for establishing expectations in both preclinical experiments and targeted clinical treatment strategies that use stem cells from patients with diverse medical histories.</p>

<p>Kaposi sarcoma is an oligoclonal HHV-8-driven vascular proliferation that was first described by a Viennese dermatologist Dr Moritz Kaposi. The disease has been seen in different clinical-epidemiological settings with a wide morphologic spectrum. We report a 52-year-old Caucasian man with HIV/AIDS and Kaposi sarcoma who presented with dyspnea and pleural effusion. He reported numerous tender subcutaneous nodules developing over the past few months on his chest, back and abdomen. An excisional biopsy of one of the nodules was performed. Touch preps revealed malignant cells in clusters. Microscopically, the neoplasm appeared undifferentiated with an epithelioid morphology, and involved the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Despite the medical history, Kaposi sarcoma was not considered foremost in the differential diagnosis. The malignant cells were positive for vimentin and negative for S100 protein, keratin AE1/3, CK7, CK20, napsin A, TTF-1 and synaptophysin. Additional stains revealed positivity for HHV-8, CD31 and D2-40, supporting the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma has been well described with many variants that may cause diagnostic difficulty. An epithelioid variant has not been reported and consequently, may cause misinterpretation of an otherwise well-known entity that may become life threatening if appropriate treatment is not initiated in a timely manner.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), often used to sample lymph nodes for lung cancer staging, is subject to sampling error even when performed with endobronchial ultrasound. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging modality that rapidly generates helical cross-sectional images. We aim to determine if needle-based OCT can provide microstructural information in lymph nodes that may be used to guide TBNA, and improve sampling error.METHODS: We performed ex vivo needle-based OCT on thoracic lymph nodes from patients with and without known lung cancer. OCT imaging features were compared against matched histology.RESULTS: OCT imaging was performed in 26 thoracic lymph nodes, including 6 lymph nodes containing metastatic carcinoma. OCT visualized lymphoid follicles, adipose tissue, pigment-laden histiocytes, and blood vessels. OCT features of metastatic carcinoma were distinct from benign lymph nodes, with microarchitectural features that reflected the morphology of the carcinoma subtype. OCT was also able to distinguish lymph node from adjacent airway wall.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that OCT provides critical microstructural information that may be useful to guide TBNA lymph node sampling, as a complement to endobronchial ultrasound. In vivo studies are needed to further evaluate the clinical utility of OCT in thoracic lymph node assessment.</p>

<p>Examination of the rectum by pathologists is instrumental in the management of patients affected by rectal carcinoma. That role includes evaluation of multiple gross and microscopic features that convey prognostic implications. The analysis is based on the authors’ experience handling rectal specimens along with review of the pertinent literature in these areas: margins of excision, quality of the mesorectum, diligence and techniques to sample lymph nodes, tumor budding, grading of residual amount of carcinoma after preoperative therapy, vascular/perineural invasion, and staging the tumor. Pathologists must communicate the findings in a clear manner. Evaluation of margins and completeness of mesorectum are markers of the quality of surgical excision. The number of lymph nodes obtained and examined is dependent in great part on the diligence of the pathologist finding them in the mesenteric adipose tissue. There are grades for budding and response to prior chemoradiation therapy. The location of vascular invasion (extramural vs. intramural) may predict aggressive behavior. Pathologists proactively are to choose sections of tumor for molecular testing. Meticulous macro- and microscopic evaluation of specimens for rectal carcinoma by pathologist is needed to determine an accurate assessment of staging and other prognostic factors. The modern pathologists play a pivotal part in the care and management of patients suffering from rectal adenocarcinoma. That role goes from the initial histological diagnosis to the gross and microscopic examination of the excised specimens. Based on that examination pathologists issue statements that not only evaluate the quality of the surgical procedure, but also through the application of molecular tests they give light on prognostic factors and information for therapeutic purposes.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of evidence that assessing the global cardiovascular risk leads to a decreased incidence of cardiovascular events, accurate patient profiling is paramount in preventive medicine. An excess of visceral fat (VF) is associated with an enhanced cardiovascular risk; importantly, VF is quantifiable rapidly, cheaply and safely by ultrasound, which makes it suitable for use in clinical practice. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate if US-measured VF (USVF) could be a better predictor of glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular risk than simple anthropometric measures.</AbstractText>: Despite the lack of evidence that assessing the global cardiovascular risk leads to a decreased incidence of cardiovascular events, accurate patient profiling is paramount in preventive medicine.

<p>We propose a regenerative solution in the treatment of critical limb ischaemia (CLI). Poly-lactic/glycolic acid microcarriers were prepared and coated with laminin to be sterilized through <U+03B3>-irradiation of 25 kGy at low temperature. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells were extracted through enzymatic digestion of adipose tissue. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice underwent arteriotomy and received an administration of SVF cells combined or not with biomimetic microcarriers. Functional evaluation of the ischaemic limb was then reported, and tissue reperfusion was evaluated through fluorescence molecular tomography. Microcarriers were stable and functional after <U+03B3>-irradiation until at least 12 months of storage. Mice that received an injection of SVF cells in the ischaemic limb have 22% of supplementary blood supply within this limb 7 days after surgery compared with vehicle, whereas no difference was observed at Day 14. With the combined therapy, the improvement of blood flow is significantly higher compared with vehicle, of about 31% at Day 7 and of about 11% at Day 14. Injection of SVF cells induces a significant 27% decrease of necrosis compared with vehicle. This effect is more important when SVF cells were mixed with biomimetic microcarriers: -37% compared with control. Although SVF cells injection leads to a non-significant 22% proprioception recovery, the combined therapy induces a significant recovery of about 27% compared with vehicle. We show that the combination of SVF cells from adipose tissue with laminin-coated poly-lactic/glycolic acid microcarriers is efficient for critical limb ischaemia therapy in a diabetic mouse model.</p>

<p>When molecular drivers of healthy adipogenesis are perturbed, this can cause hepatic steatosis. The role of arachidonic acid (AA) and its downstream enzymatic cascades, such as cyclooxygenase, in adipogenesis is well established. The exact contribution of the P450 epoxygenase pathway, however, remains to be established. Enzymes belonging to this pathway are mainly encoded by the CYP2J locus which shows extensive allelic expansion in mice. Here we aimed to establish the role of endogenous epoxygenase during adipogenesis under homeostatic and metabolic stress conditions.</AbstractText>: When molecular drivers of healthy adipogenesis are perturbed, this can cause hepatic steatosis.

<p>BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine whether the anterolateral ligament (ALL) had a histological structure that defined it as a real ligament.METHODS: Histological examination of 30 ALL samples taken from fresh-frozen knees were performed. The ALL femoral insertion and its relationship with the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) were studied and the tibial insertion and its relationship with articular cartilage of the tibial joint surface were analyzed. For the ligamentous part, its histological structure and its differences with the articular capsule were studied.RESULTS: This connective tissue is composed of a dense fibrous core constituted by a network of oriented collagenous fibers. The periphery of this dense connective center is made up of loose fibrocollagenous tissue with vascular structures and focal deposits of adipose tissue. This part was in contact but different to the joint capsule. With a perpendicular orientation of the collagen fibers relative to the bone, a fibrocartilaginous zone with an unmineralized hyalinized aspect, a mineralization front, its bone insertions presented a typical ligamentous insertion. With a cleavage plane between ALL and LCL femoral insertion, the ALL appeared to have a femoral insertion distinct from the LCL. ALL tibial insertion was less characteristic with less organized connective tissue and was at a distance from the articular cartilage.CONCLUSION: From its bony insertion to its tissue composition and organization, the ALL has all the histological characteristics of a ligamentous structure. Our study confirms that ALL can be considered a real and distinct ligament.</p>

<p>The deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap is one of the most common techniques for breast reconstruction. Body mass index (BMI) is considered as an important predictor of donor site healing complications such as wound dehiscence. The use of computed tomography (CT) proved to be a precise and objective method to assess visceral adipose tissue. It remains unclear whether quantification of visceral fat provides more accurate predictions of abdominal wound healing complications than BMI.</AbstractText>: The deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap is one of the most common techniques for breast reconstruction.

<p>Reconstructive treatment after trauma and tumor resection would greatly benefit from an effective soft tissue regeneration. The use of cell-free scaffolds for adipose tissue regeneration in vivo is emerging as an attractive alternative to tissue-engineered constructs, since this approach avoids complications due to cell manipulation and lack of synchronous vascularization. In this study, we developed a biodegradable polyurethane-based scaffold for soft tissue regeneration, characterized by an exceptional combination between softness and resilience. Exploring the potential as a cell-free scaffold required profound understanding of the impact of its intrinsic physico-chemical properties on the biological performance in vivo. We investigated the effect of the scaffold’s hydrophilic character, degradation kinetics, and internal morphology on (i) the local inflammatory response and activation of MGCs (foreign body response); (ii) its ability to promote rapid vascularisation, cell infiltration and migration through the scaffold over time; and (iii) the grade of maturation of the newly formed tissue into vascularized soft tissue in a murine model. The study revealed that soft tissue regeneration in vivo proceeded by gradual infiltration of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells though the periphery toward the center of the scaffold, where the rapid formation of a functional and well-formed vascular network supported cell viability overtime.Exploring the potential of polyurethane-based soft foam as cell-free scaffold for soft tissue regeneration. In this work, we address the unmet need for synthetic functional soft tissue substitutes that provide adequate biological and mechanical support to soft tissue. We developed a series of flexible cross-linked polyurethane copolymer scaffolds with remarkable fatigue-resistance and tunable physico-chemical properties for soft tissue regeneration in vivo. Accordingly, we could extend the potential of this class of biomaterials, which was so far confined for bone and osteochondral tissue regeneration, to other types of connective tissue.</AbstractText>: Exploring the potential of polyurethane-based soft foam as cell-free scaffold for soft tissue regeneration.

<p>Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) increase the risks of infection and amputation in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). The impaired function and senescence of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and high glucose-induced ROS likely exacerbate DFUs. We assessed EPCs in 60 patients with DM in a hospital or primary care setting. We also evaluated the therapeutic effects of exosomes secreted from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on stress-mediated senescence of EPCs induced by high glucose. Additionally, the effects of exosomes and Nrf2 overexpression in ADSCs were investigated in vitro and in vivo in a diabetic rat model. We found that ADSCs that secreted exosomes promoted proliferation and angiopoiesis in EPCs in a high glucose environment and that overexpression of Nrf2 increased this protective effect. Wounds in the feet of diabetic rats had a significantly reduced ulcerated area when treated with exosomes from ADSCs overexpressing Nrf2. Increased granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, and levels of growth factor expression as well as reduced levels of inflammation and oxidative stress-related proteins were detected in wound beds. Our data suggest that exosomes from ADSCs can potentially promote wound healing, particularly when overexpressing Nrf2 and therefore that the transplantation of exosomes may be suitable for clinical application in the treatment of DFUs.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Tissue engineering today uses factors that can induce differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into other cell types. However, the problem of angiogenesis in this differentiated tissue remains an unresolved area of research interest. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of prostaglandin F-2a (PGF-2a) on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human adipose tissue derived MSCs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental research, human adipose tissue was digested using collagenase. The isolated MSCs cells were treated with PGF-2a (up to 5 µg/ml) and incubated for 96 hours. Cell proliferation, secretion of VEGF and cell migration were spontaneously assayed by MTT, BrdU, ELISA, RT-PCR and scratching methods.RESULTS: Cell growth at 1.0, 2.5, 5 µg/ml of PGF-2a was not significantly reduced compared to control cells, suggesting that these concentrations of PGF-2a are not toxic to cell growth. The results of the BrdU incorporation assay indicated that, in comparison to untreated cells, BrdU incorporation was respectively 1.08, 1.96, 2.0 and 1.8 fold among cells treated with 0.1, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 µg/ml of PGF-2a. The scratching test also demonstrated a positive influence on cell proliferation and migration. Cells treated with 1.0 µg/ml of PGF-2a for 12 hours showed the highest relative migration and coverage in comparison to untreated cells. Quantitative VEGF ELISA and RTPCR results indicated an increase in VEGF expression and secretion in the presence of PGF-2a. The amount of VEGF produced in response to 0.1, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 µg/ml of PGF-2a was 62.4 ± 3.2 , 66.3 ± 3.7, 53.1 ± 2.6 and 49.0 ± 2.3 pg/ml, respectively, compared to the 35.2 ± 2.1 pg/ml produced by untreated cells.CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of VEGF secretion by PGF-2a treated MSCs could be useful for the induction of angiogenesis in tissue engineering in vitro.</p>

<p>Obesity (especially visceral adiposity) can be associated with 3 different phenotypes of heart failure: heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, and high-output heart failure. All 3 phenotypes are characterized by an excessive secretion of aldosterone and sodium retention. In addition, obesity is accompanied by increased signaling through the leptin receptor, which can promote activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system and can directly stimulate the secretion of aldosterone. The deleterious interaction of leptin and aldosterone is potentiated by the simultaneous action of adiposity and the renal sympathetic nerves to cause overactivity of neprilysin; the loss of the counterbalancing effects of natriuretic peptides is exacerbated by an additional effect of both obesity and heart failure to interfere with adiponectin signaling. This intricate neurohormonal interplay leads to plasma volume expansion as well as to adverse ventricular remodeling and cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, the activity of aldosterone and neprilysin is not only enhanced by obesity, but these mechanisms can also promote adipogenesis and adipocyte dysfunction, thereby enhancing the positive feedback loop. Last, in elderly obese women, changes in quantity and biology of epicardial adipose tissue further enhances the release of leptin and other proinflammatory adipokines, thereby leading to cardiac and systemic inflammation, end-organ fibrosis, and multiple comorbidities. Regardless of the phenotypic expression, activation of the leptin-aldosterone-neprilysin axis appears to contribute importantly to the evolution and progression of heart failure in people with obesity. Efforts to interfere with the detrimental interactions of this distinctive neurohormonal ecosystem with existing or novel therapeutic agents are likely to yield unique clinical benefits.</p>

<p>This study investigated the effects of a grape pomace extract (GPE) rich in phenolic compounds on brown-like adipocyte induction and adiposity in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and control normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). HFD consumption for 10 weeks significantly increased epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in WKY but not in SHR rats. Supplementation with GPE (300 mg/kg body weight/day) reduced adipocyte diameter and increased levels of proteins that participate in adipogenesis and angiogenesis, i.e., peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>), vascular endothelial grow factor-A (VEGF-A) and its receptor 2 (VEGF-R2), and partially increased the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) in WKY. In both strains, GPE attenuated adipose inflammation. In eWAT from SHR, GPE increased the expression of proteins involved in adipose tissue “browning,” i.e., PPAR<U+03B3>-coactivator-1a (PGC-1a), PPAR<U+03B3>, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and UCP-1. In primary cultures of SHR adipocytes, GPE-induced UCP-1 up-regulation was dependent on p38 and ERK activation. Accordingly, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with palmitate, the addition of GPE (30 µM) activated the ß-adrenergic signaling cascade (PKA, AMPK, p38, ERK). This led to the associated up-regulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1a, PPAR<U+03B3>, PRDM16 and UCP-1) and fatty acid oxidation (ATGL). These effects were similar to those exerted by (-)-epicatechin and quercetin, major phenolic compounds in GPE. Overall, in HFD-fed rats, supplementation with GPE promoted brown-like cell formation in eWAT and diminished adipose dysfunction. Thus, winemaking residues, rich in bioactive compounds, could be useful to mitigate the adverse effects of HFD-induced adipose dysfunction.</p>

<p>Adequate distribution of antiretroviral drugs to infected cells in HIV patients is critical for viral suppression. In humans and primates, HIV- and SIV-infected CD4 T cells in adipose tissues have recently been identified as reservoirs for infectious virus. To better characterize adipose tissue as a pharmacological sanctuary for HIV-infected cells, in vitro experiments were conducted to assess antiretroviral drug efficacy in the presence of adipocytes, and drug penetration in adipose tissue cells (stromal-vascular-fraction cells and mature adipocytes) was examined in treated humans and monkeys. Co-culture experiments between HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells and primary human adipocytes showed that adipocytes consistently reduced the antiviral efficacy of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir and its prodrug forms tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). In HIV-infected persons, LC-MS/MS analysis of intracellular lysates derived from adipose tissue stromal-vascular-fraction cells or mature adipocytes suggested that integrase inhibitors penetrate adipose tissue, whereas penetration of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as TDF, emtricitabine, abacavir, and lamivudine is restricted. The limited distribution and functions of key antiretroviral drugs within fat depots may contribute to viral persistence in adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) controls triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) catabolism. This process is mediated by the lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme that catalyzed the hydrolysis of triglyceride (TAG) in glycerol and fatty acids (FA), which are burned to generate heat. LPL activity is regulated by angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a secretory protein produced in adipose tissues (AT), liver, kidney, and muscle.

<p>Purpose/Aim: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common diabetic microvascular complication, and it typically develops after 10 years of diabetes diagnosis. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the association between adiposity and DR susceptibility among individuals with longstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, DR was assessed by fundus photography in 953 T2D subjects. DR prevalence by categories of T2D duration was evaluated. In a sub-cohort analysis, subjects having T2D for =10 years were divided into DR (N = 241) and non-DR (N = 377) groups. Measures of adiposity including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and visceral fat area (VFA) were analyzed. Urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were measured.RESULTS: DR prevalence markedly increased 10 years after T2D diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001). Among subjects with T2D duration =10 years, BMI, WC, and VFA were elevated in DR compared with non-DR (all p &lt; 0.05). Contrasting with BMI and WC, the association between VFA and DR sustained adjustment for demographics, metabolic factors, and insulin treatment (OR: 1.060, 95% CI: 1.004-1.119, p = 0.035). However, the association became insignificant after controlling for ACR and eGFR. Mediation analysis revealed that ACR and eGFR explained 47.3% of the relationship between VFA and DR.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that visceral adiposity is associated with DR in individuals with longstanding T2D. This relationship may be attributable to generalized vascular injury as reflected by coexisting renal burden. Therefore, effective management of visceral adiposity and ameliorating renal burden may ameliorate susceptibility to DR.</p>

<p>Diabetic wounds have impaired healing and a propensity for further morbidity, which may result in amputations. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is an autologous source of heterogeneous cell population obtained from adipose tissue, which is rich in stem cells and presents little immunogenicity to the host. In this study, we hypothesized that murine fibroblasts subjected to hyperglycemic conditions co-treated with SVF exhibit greater functional activity through the colorimetric MTT assay and a cell-monolayer in-vitro scratch assay. We sought to establish the underlying mechanism of action via the utility of an ELISA chemiluminescence array on the supernatant medium of the cells. Our results demonstrate that the mean percentage gap closure at 24<U+202F>h in the hyperglycemia<U+202F>+<U+202F>SVF group was significantly greater at 41.1%<U+202F>±<U+202F>1.6% compared to the hyperglycemia alone group 16.6%<U+202F>±<U+202F>1.5% (post-hoc Bonferroni test p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>3) although there was no difference between the SVF and normoglycemia group. Further, this SVF group exhibited a significantly greater 2.4 fold increase in fibroblastic cell viability as compared to the hyperglycemia alone group (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.001, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>3). The supernatant medium of the cells upon testing with ELISA indicated that early phase wound healing cytokines including platelet-derived growth factor (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.012, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>3), interleukin-1 (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.003, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>3), basic fibroblast growth factor (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.003, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>3) and interleukin-10 (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.009, n<U+202F>=<U+202F>3) were expressed in significantly greater relative luminescent units in SVF as compared to hyperglycemia alone groups (Student t-test). Taken together and for the first time, our study shows that SVF is a promising therapeutic agent for up-regulating fibroblastic activity in a hyperglycemic microenvironment, and this result can be explained in part by the stimulation of wound-healing cytokines.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with increased risk of premature death, morbidity, and mortality from several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. However, this is not a straightforward relationship. Although several studies have substantiated that obesity confers an independent and additive risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, there is significant variability in these associations, with some lean individuals developing diseases and others remaining healthy despite severe obesity, the so-called metabolically healthy obese. Part of this variability has been attributed to the heterogeneity in both the distribution of body fat and the intrinsic properties of adipose tissue depots, including developmental origin, adipogenic and proliferative capacity, glucose and lipid metabolism, hormonal control, thermogenic ability, and vascularization. In obesity, these depot-specific differences translate into specific fat distribution patterns, which are closely associated with differential cardiometabolic risks. The adventitial fat layer, also known as perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), is of major importance. Similar to the visceral adipose tissue, PVAT has a pathophysiological role in CVDs. PVAT influences vascular homeostasis by releasing numerous vasoactive factors, cytokines, and adipokines, which can readily target the underlying smooth muscle cell layers, regulating the vascular tone, distribution of blood flow, as well as angiogenesis, inflammatory processes, and redox status. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT within the scope of adipose tissue as a major contributing factor to obesity-associated cardiovascular risk. Relevant clinical studies documenting the relationship between PVAT dysfunction and CVD with a focus on potential mechanisms by which PVAT contributes to obesity-related CVDs are pointed out.</p>

<p>In reconstructive surgery, transfer of patients’ tissue (autologous flaps) is routinely used to repair large soft tissue defects caused by surgery, trauma, chronic diseases, or malformations; unfortunately, this strategy is not always possible and often creates a secondary defect in the donor site of the tissue. Tissue-engineered synthetic flaps are currently unable to repair clinically-relevant, large-volume defects; allogenic flaps from cadaveric donors could provide a ready-to-use biological alternative if treated with methods to avoid the immune-rejection of the donor’s cells. Here, we describe the successful decellularization of a large (&gt; 800 cc) human-derived adipose flap through a perfusion apparatus; we demonstrate the complete removal of the immunogenic cellular components of the flap with the retention of its structural components and vascular network. Our aim is to obtain a universally compatible, off-the-shelf acellular allogenic flap that could be recellularized with cells from recipient patients to provide a tissue-engineered allogenic/autologous alternative for reconstruction of large-volume soft-tissue defects.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) expands via both hypertrophy and hyperplasia during the development of obesity. While AT hypertrophy involves the increase in size of existing adipocytes, hyperplasia is the process of creating new adipocytes from the pool of adipocyte precursor cells (APCs), which includes adipocyte progenitor cells and preadipocytes. Prior studies have implicated a role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in regulation of hyperplasia in white adipose tissue (WAT). Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying SNS regulation of APC proliferation in mouse WAT. Using flow cytometry with antibodies against various cell surface markers, along with an intracellular marker of proliferation (Ki67), we quantitated the percentages and proliferative status of adipocyte progenitor cells and preadipocytes in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of WAT. In vivo SNS activation through cold exposure, as well as in vitro adrenergic stimulation via exposure to the canonical SNS neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), inhibited preadipocyte proliferation. Pretreatment with propranolol, a ß1- and ß2-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist, trended toward rescuing the inhibitory effects of NE in primary cell culture. The selective ß1-AR agonist dobutamine diminished preadipocyte proliferation both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the selective ß2-AR agonist, salbutamol, promoted proliferation in vitro, suggesting that the ß1-AR may mediate the inhibitory effect of NE on preadipocyte proliferation. Taken together, we conclude that SNS activation suppresses preadipocyte proliferation via activation of the ß1 AR in WAT.</p>

<p>In Syrian hamsters, brown adipose tissue (BAT) develops postnatally through the proliferation and differentiation of brown adipocyte progenitors. In the study reported here, we investigated how ambient temperature influenced BAT formation in neonatal hamsters. In both hamsters raised at 23 or 30 °C, the interscapular fat changed from white to brown coloration in an age-dependent manner and acquired the typical morphological features of BAT by day 16. However, the expression of uncoupling protein 1, a brown adipocyte marker, and of vascular endothelial growth factor a were lower in the group raised at 30 °C than in that raised at 23 °C. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that the proportion of Ki67-expressing progenitors and endothelial cells was lower in the 30 °C group than in the 23 °C group. These results indicate that warm ambient temperature suppresses the proliferation of brown adipocyte progenitors and endothelial cells and negatively affects the postnatal development of BAT in Syrian hamsters.</p>

<p>Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is rare. It is characterized by the gradual transformation of retroperitoneal adipose tissue into a fibrous mass surrounding the aorta, the inferior vena cava and the urinary tract responsible for progressive alteration in the renal function. It usually manifests as lumbar pain associated with renal failure and biologic inflammatory syndrome. We report 12 cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis in order to determine its clinical, radiological and therapeutic features. We conducted a retrospective study of 12 patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis whose medical data were collected in the Departement of Urology at the University Hospital Hassan II, Fes over a period of 9 years (2005-2013). The study involved ten men and two women. Clinical symptomatology was very variable, dominated by lumbar pain in all patients and hydrocele in 1 patient. Laboratory tests showed renal failure in all patients and inflammatory syndrome in 10 patients. The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis was suspected in all patients on ultrasound showing obstruction of the upper urinary tract without visible obstacle. The diagnosis was confirmed by abdominal CT scan without contrast that objectified a retroperitoneal tissue lesion enveloping the vessels and the urinary tract. Nine patients had idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. Two patients had perianeurysmal fibrosis and one patient had post-radiation fibrosis. All patients underwent urinary drainage by double J. ureteral catheter. Seven patients underwent corticosteroid therapy. Six patients had an improvement of clinical and laboratory test outcome with disappearance of pain and improvement of the general condition. This study confirms the rarity of retroperitoneal fibrosis, the difficulty of diagnosis, pain associated with inflammatory syndrome and renal failure as common manifestations. Abdominal CT scan without contrast is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis. Urinary drainage is essential in most cases as well as regular monitoring of patients.</p>

<p>Objective Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events and decrease the body fat mass in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We examined whether or not the SGLT2-inhibitor dapagliflozin can improve the endothelial function associated with a reduction in abdominal fat mass. Methods We prospectively recruited patients with uncontrolled [hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt;7.0%] T2DM who were not being treated by SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients were treated with add-on dapagliflozin (5 mg/day) or non-SGLT2 inhibitor medicines for 6 months to improve their HbA1c. We measured the peripheral microvascular endothelial function as assessed by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) and calculated the natural logarithmic transformed value of the RH-PAT index (LnRHI). We then investigated changes in the LnRHI and abdominal fat area using computed tomography (CT). Results The subjects were 54 patients with uncontrolled T2DM (72.2% men) with a mean HbA1c of 8.1%. The HbA1c was significantly decreased in both groups, with no significant difference between the groups. Dapagliflozin treatment, but not non-SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, significantly increased the LnRHI. The changes in the LnRHI were significantly greater in the dapagliflozin group than in the non-SGLT2 inhibitor group. Dapagliflozin treatment, but not non-SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, significantly decreased the abdominal visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and total fat area (TFA) as assessed by CT and significantly increased the plasma adiponectin levels. The percentage changes in the LnRHI were significantly correlated with changes in the SFA, TFA, systolic blood pressure, and adiponectin. Conclusion Add-on treatment with dapagliflozin significantly improves the glycemic control and endothelial function associated with a reduction in the abdominal fat mass in patients with uncontrolled T2DM.</p>

<p>The 12-lipoxygenase (12LO) pathway is a promising target to reduce islet dysfunction, adipose tissue (AT) inflammation and insulin resistance. Optimal pre-clinical models for the investigation of selective12LO inhibitors in this context have not yet been identified. The objective of this study was to characterize the time course of 12LO isoform expression and metabolite production in pancreatic islets and AT of C57BLKS/J-db/db obese diabetic mouse in a pre-diabetic state in order to establish a suitable therapeutic window for intervention with selective lipoxygenase inhibitors. Mice have 2 major 12LO isoforms -the leukocyte type (12/15LO) and the platelet type (p12LO) and both are expressed in islets and AT. We found a sharp increase in protein expression of 12/15LO in the pancreatic islets of 10-week old db-/- mice compared to 8- week old counterparts. Immunohistochemistry showed that the increase in islet 12/15LO parallels a decline in islet number. Analysis of 12- and 15-hydroperoxytetraeicosanoid acids (HETE)s showed a 2-3 fold increase especially in 12(S)-HETE that mirrored the increase in 12/15LO expression in islets. Analysis of AT and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) showed a significant increase of platelet 12LO gene expression along with 12- and 15- HETEs. The data demonstrate that the db/db mouse is a suitable model for investigation of 12/15LO inhibitors in the development of inflammatory mediated type 2 diabetes, with a narrow window of therapeutic intervention prior to 8 weeks of age.</p>

<p>A highly interesting source for adult stem cells is adipose tissue, from which the stromal vascular fraction (SVF)-a heterogeneous cell population including the adipose-derived stromal/stem cells-can be obtained. To enhance the regenerative potential of freshly isolated SVF cells, low-level light therapy (LLLT) was used. The effects of pulsed blue (475 nm), green (516 nm), and red (635 nm) light from light-emitting diodes applied on freshly isolated SVF were analysed regarding cell phenotype, cell number, viability, adenosine triphosphate content, cytotoxicity, and proliferation but also osteogenic, adipogenic, and proangiogenic differentiation potential. The colony-forming unit fibroblast assay revealed a significantly increased colony size after LLLT with red light compared with untreated cells, whereas the frequency of colony-forming cells was not affected. LLLT with green and red light resulted in a stronger capacity to form vascular tubes by SVF when cultured within 3D fibrin matrices compared with untreated cells, which was corroborated by increased number and length of the single tubes and a significantly higher concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor. Our study showed beneficial effects after LLLT on the vascularization potential and proliferation capacity of SVF cells. Therefore, LLLT using pulsed light-emitting diode light might represent a new approach for activation of freshly isolated SVF cells for direct clinical application.</p>

<p>The aim of this was to investigate the histology and immunohistochemistry of interstitial glands during non-breeding season in camel ovaries. A total of 21 mature, non-pregnant and apparently healthy camels aged between 8 and 12 years were slaughtered. The ovaries were removed within 15 min, cleaned from adipose tissue, weighted and examined grossly. The histological preparation was made, and then, the blocks were cut at 3-5 microns thickness and stained by H&amp;E for histological examinations. Moreover, some sections were stained with Sudan Black for lipid detection. Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded ovarian tissues was performed to detect the localization of S-100, vimentin, progesterone receptors (PR) and oestrogen receptors (ER). Immunoreactive signals were detected using UltraVision Detection System. The results revealed that the interstitial glands were located in the cortical region and they were arranged in various arrangements either single, in couple or in groups rich in lipid droplet. All interstitial gland arrangements were enclosed by connective tissue capsules containing fibroblasts and collagenous fibres separated them from the surrounding ovarian structures. Both interstitial glands and their surrounding CT were penetrated by several blood vessels. There was a strong immunoreactive signal for S-100 in the nuclei of interstitial cells, and no signals were detected either in cells of the interstitial glands or their connective tissue with PR. We could conclude that the interstitial gland is distinct in ovary of camel and further studies are needed to elucidate its rule in steroid synthesis.</p>

<p>Obesity is the result of abnormal adipose development and energy metabolism. Using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) B-knockout and inducible VEGF downregulation mouse models, we have shown that VEGFB inactivation caused expansion of white adipose, whitening of brown adipose, an increase in fat accumulation, and a reduction in energy consumption. At the same time, expression of the white adipose-associated genes was increased and brown adipose-associated genes decreased. VEGF repression, in contrast, induced brown adipose expansion and brown adipocyte development in white adipose, increased energy expenditure, upregulated brown adipose-associated genes, and downregulated white adipose-associated genes. When VEGFB-knockout and VEGF-repressed mice are crossed together, VEGF and VEGFB can counteractively regulate large numbers of genes and efficiently reverse each other’s roles. These genes, under counteractive VEGF and VEGFB regulations, include transcription factors, adhesion molecules, and metabolic enzymes. This balancing role is confirmed by morphologic and functional changes. This study reports that VEGF and VEGFB counteractively regulate adipose development and function in energy metabolism.</p>

<p>Many favorable metabolic effects have been attributed to thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Yet, time of day has rarely been considered in this field of research. Here, we show that a diurnal rhythm in BAT activity regulates plasma lipid metabolism. We observed a high-amplitude rhythm in fatty acid uptake by BAT that synchronized with the light/dark cycle. Highest uptake was found at the onset of the active period, which coincided with high lipoprotein lipase expression and low angiopoietin-like 4 expression by BAT. Diurnal rhythmicity in BAT activity determined the rate at which lipids were cleared from the circulation, thereby imposing the daily rhythm in plasma lipid concentrations. In mice as well as humans, postprandial lipid excursions were nearly absent at waking. We anticipate that diurnal BAT activity is an important factor to consider when studying the therapeutic potential of promoting BAT activity.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) stores excess energy as triglycerides, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized in dissipating energy as heat. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in a broad range of physiological processes and is increasingly recognized as a key player in adipose tissue metabolism. High ECS tonus in the fed state is associated with a disadvantageous metabolic phenotype, and this has led to a search for pharmacological strategies to inhibit the ECS. In this review we present recent developments that cast light on the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism by the ECS, and we discuss novel treatment options including the modulation of endocannabinoid synthesis and breakdown enzymes.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a multifunctional circulating glycoprotein that can induce insulin resistance. Lately, adipose tissue has gained prominence as an effector site of fetuin-A. Although fetuin-A-induced proinflammatory polarization and migration of macrophages plays a crucial role, it remains obscure whether monocyte subsets in circulation could simulate characteristics of macrophages in adipose tissues. This study aims to investigate the correlation between monocyte subsets with fetuin-A and its relevant insulin resistance.CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte subsets in circulation, including proinflammatory intermediate monocytes, were not associated with fetuin-A and insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Our previous studies have shown that response gene to complement (RGC)-32 deficiency (Rgc32<sup>-/-</sup>) protects mice from diet-induced obesity and increases thermogenic gene expression in adipose tissues. However, the underlying mechanisms by which RGC-32 regulates thermogenic gene expression remain to be determined. In the present study, RGC-32 expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) was suppressed during cold exposure-induced WAT browning. Rgc32<sup>-/-</sup> significantly increased thermogenic gene expression in the differentiated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of inguinal (i)WAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT). Rgc32<sup>-/-</sup> and cold exposure regulated a common set of genes in iWAT, as shown by RNA sequencing data. Pathway enrichment analyses showed that Rgc32<sup>-/-</sup> down-regulated PI3K/Akt signaling-related genes. Akt phosphorylation was also consistently decreased in Rgc32<sup>-/-</sup> iWAT, which led to an increase in ß3-adrenergic receptor (ß3-AR) expression and subsequent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)-1. ß3-AR antagonist SR 59230A and mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin blocked Rgc32<sup>-/-</sup>-induced thermogenic gene expression in both iWAT and interscapular BAT. These results indicate that RGC-32 suppresses adipose tissue thermogenic gene expression through down-regulation of ß3-AR expression and mTORC1 activity via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.-Chen, S., Mei, X., Yin, A., Yin, H., Cui, X.-B., Chen, S.-Y.

<p>The evaluation of the morphological characteristics of small resistance arteries in humans is challenging. The gold standard method is generally considered to be the measurement by wire or pressure micromyography of the media-to-lumen ratio of subcutaneous small vessels obtained by local biopsies. However, noninvasive techniques for the evaluation of retinal arterioles were recently proposed; in particular, two approaches, scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF) and adaptive optics, seem to provide useful information; both of them provide an estimation of the wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) of retinal arterioles. Moreover, a noninvasive measurement of basal and total capillary density may be obtained by videomicroscopy/capillaroscopy. No direct comparison of these three noninvasive techniques in the same population was previously performed; in particular, adaptive optics was never validated against micromyography.</AbstractText>: The evaluation of the morphological characteristics of small resistance arteries in humans is challenging.

<p>Infiltration of immune cells in the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (AT) deposits leads to a low-grade inflammation contributing to the development of obesity-associated complications such as type 2 diabetes. To quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the immune cell subsets in human AT deposits, we have developed a flow cytometry approach. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF), containing the immune cells, is isolated from subcutaneous and visceral AT biopsies by collagenase digestion. Adipocytes are removed after centrifugation. The SVF cells are stained for multiple membrane-bound markers selected to differentiate between immune cell subsets and analyzed using flow cytometry. As a result of this approach, pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage subsets, dendritic cells (DCs), B-cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, and NK cells can be detected and quantified. This method gives detailed information about immune cells in AT and the amount of each specific subset. Since there are numerous fluorescent antibodies available, our flow cytometry approach can be adjusted to measure various other cellular and intracellular markers of interest.</p>

<p>Mutations in LMNA, encoding A-type lamins, are responsible for laminopathies including muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies, and premature ageing syndromes. LMNA mutations have been shown to alter nuclear structure and stiffness, binding to partners at the nuclear envelope or within the nucleoplasm, gene expression and/or prelamin A maturation. LMNA-associated lipodystrophic features, combining generalized or partial fat atrophy and metabolic alterations associated with insulin resistance, could result from altered adipocyte differentiation or from altered fat structure. Recent studies shed some light on how pathogenic A-type lamin variants could trigger lipodystrophy, metabolic complications, and precocious cardiovascular events. Alterations in adipose tissue extracellular matrix and TGF-beta signaling could initiate metabolic inflexibility. Premature senescence of vascular cells could contribute to cardiovascular complications. In affected families, metabolic alterations occur at an earlier age across generations, which could result from epigenetic deregulation induced by LMNA mutations. Novel cellular models recapitulating adipogenic developmental pathways provide scalable tools for disease modeling and therapeutic screening.</p>

<p>Visceral fat accumulation increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and is associated with excessive glucocorticoids (GCs). Fat depot-specific GC action is tightly controlled by 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11ß-HSD1) coupled with the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH).

<p>Alterations in ectopic lipid deposition and circulating lipids are major risk factors for developing cardiometabolic diseases. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), a protein that inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL), controls fatty acid (FA) uptake in adipose and oxidative tissues and regulates circulating triacylglycerol-rich (TAG-rich) lipoproteins. Unfortunately, global depletion of ANGPTL4 results in severe metabolic abnormalities, inflammation, and fibrosis when mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD), limiting our understanding of the contribution of ANGPTL4 in metabolic disorders. Here, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of ANGPTL4 in adipose tissue (AT) results in enhanced LPL activity, rapid clearance of circulating TAGs, increased AT lipolysis and FA oxidation, and decreased FA synthesis in AT. Most importantly, we found that absence of ANGPTL4 in AT prevents excessive ectopic lipid deposition in the liver and muscle, reducing novel PKC (nPKC) membrane translocation and enhancing insulin signaling. As a result, we observed a remarkable improvement in glucose tolerance in short-term HFD-fed AT-specific Angptl4-KO mice. Finally, lack of ANGPTL4 in AT enhances the clearance of proatherogenic lipoproteins, attenuates inflammation, and reduces atherosclerosis. Together, these findings uncovered an essential role of AT ANGPTL4 in regulating peripheral lipid deposition, influencing whole-body lipid and glucose metabolism and the progression of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Hyaluronan is abundant in the extracellular matrix of many desmoplastic tumors and determines in large part the tumor biochemical and mechanical microenvironment. Additionally, it has been identified as one of the major physiological barriers to the effective delivery of drugs to solid tumors and its targeting with the use of pharmaceutical agents has shown to decompress tumor blood vessels, and thus improve tumor perfusion and efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. In this study, we investigated the contribution of hyaluronan to the accumulation of mechanical forces in tumors. Using experimental data from two orthotopic breast tumor models and treating tumors with two clinically approved anti-fibrotic drugs (tranilast and pirfenidone), we found that accumulation of growth-induced, residual forces in tumors are associated with hyaluronan content. Furthermore, mechanical characterization of the tumors revealed a good correlation of the accumulated forces with the elastic modulus of the tissue. Our results provide important insights on the mechano-pathology of solid tumors and can be used for the design of therapeutic strategies that target hyaluronan.</p>

<p>Natural killer (NK) lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion control infections and cancers, but these crucial activities decline with age. NK cell development, homeostasis, and function require IL-15 and its chaperone, IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra). Macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) are major sources of these proteins. We had previously postulated that additional IL-15 and IL-15Ra is made by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These sources may be important in aging, when IL-15-producing immune cells decline. NK cells circulate through adipose tissue, where they may be exposed to local IL-15. The objectives of this work were to determine (1) if human muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) are sources of IL-15 and IL-15 Ra, and (2) whether any of these tissues correlate with NK cell activity in elderly humans. We first investigated IL-15 and IL-15Ra RNA expression in paired muscle and SAT biopsies from healthy human subjects. Both tissues expressed these transcripts, but IL-15Ra RNA levels were higher in SAT than in skeletal muscle. We also investigated tissue obtained from surgeries and found that SAT and VAT expressed equivalent amounts of IL-15 and IL-15Ra RNA, respectively. Furthermore, stromal vascular fraction cells expressed more IL-15 RNA than did adipocytes. To test if these findings related to circulating IL-15 protein and NK cell function, we tested 50 healthy adults aged<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>70<U+2009>years old. Plasma IL-15 levels significantly correlated with abdominal VAT mass in the entire cohort and in non-obese subjects. However, plasma IL-15 levels did not correlate with skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and correlated inversely with muscle strength. Plasma IL-15 did correlate with NK cell cytotoxic granule exocytosis and with CCL4 (MIP-1ß) production in response to NKp46-crosslinking. Additionally, NK cell responses to K562 leukemia cells correlated inversely with muscle strength. With aging, immune function declines while infections, cancers, and deaths increase. We propose that VAT-derived IL-15 and IL-15Ra is a compensatory NK cell support mechanism in elderly humans.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability between bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (BM-MSCs) and adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) or umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) on promotion of vessels formation and vessels stabilization relevant to the functions of EPCs.<U+2029> Methods: In vitro, co-culture blood vessel test was performed to compare the angiogenic ability between BM-MSCs, AD-MSCs or UC-MSCs. In vivo, angiogenic assay dependent on basement membrane matrix Matrigel and immunohistochemistry were performed to compare the ability of vessels formation functions between BM-MSCs and AD-MSCs or UC-MSCs.<U+2029> Results: The lengths and dots of vascular structures formed by EPCs on AD-MSCs layer are greater than those by EPCs on BM-MSCs layer and UC-MSCs layer in angiogenic assay in vitro. The stability of the capillary-like structures formed by EPCs with AD-MSCs on Matrigel was more stable than that by the BM-MSCs, UC-MSCs or EPCs. AD-MSCs and EPCs could form abundant functional vessels with blood perfusion in Matrigelin vivo; UC-MSCs and EPCs could form a few functional vessels with blood perfusion in Matrigelin vivo; BM-MSCs and EPCs could form broken vessels with hemocytes leakage in Matrigel in vivo.<U+2029> Conclusion: AD-MSCs have the stronger ability to promote the angiogenesis and stabilize the vessels compared with BM-MSCs or UC-MSCs ex vivo and in vivo.</p>

<p>The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia. Adipocytes surrounding the ascending aorta present markers of major thermogenic activity than those in subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>This study is aimed at examining whether a suprachoroidal graft of autologous cells can improve best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and responses to microperimetry (MY) in eyes affected by dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) over time through the production and secretion of growth factors (GFs) on surrounding tissue. Patients were randomly assigned to each study group. All patients were diagnosed with dry AMD and with BCVA equal to or greater than 1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR). A suprachoroidal autologous graft by Limoli Retinal Restoration Technique (LRRT) was carried out on group A, which included 11 eyes from 11 patients. The technique was performed by implanting adipocytes, adipose-derived stem cells obtained from the stromal vascular fraction, and platelets from platelet-rich plasma in the suprachoroidal space. Conversely, group B, including 14 eyes of 14 patients, was used as a control group. For each patient, diagnosis was verified by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope and spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). In group A, BCVA improved by 0.581 to 0.504 at 90 days and to 0.376 logMAR at 180 days (+32.20%) postoperatively. Furthermore, MY test increased by 11.44 dB to 12.59 dB at 180 days. The different cell types grafted behind the choroid were able to ensure constant GF secretion in the choroidal flow. Consequently, the results indicate that visual acuity (VA) in the grafted group can increase more than in the control group after six months.</p>

<p>Population studies have linked insulin resistance to systemic low-grade chronic inflammation and have reported elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, IL-1ß and IL-6, individually or in certain combinations, in adipose tissues or in the serum. We undertook this comprehensive study to simultaneously evaluate the expression of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum and in the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues from obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We observed that several inflammatory cytokines implicated in obesity-associated inflammation showed no significant difference in protein or gene expression between obese patients with or without diabetes and control groups. IL1B gene expression was significantly elevated in the visceral adipose tissues of obese patients, but did not correlate with their diabetes status. Despite the significant increase in IL1B expression in the obese group, a significant proportion of obese patients did not express TNFA, IL1B or IL6 in visceral adipose tissues. Certain inflammatory cytokines showed correlation with the chemokine CCL2 and VEGF-A in visceral adipose tissues. Our findings suggest that the inflammatory cytokine profile in metabolic syndrome is more complex than what is currently perceived and that chronic inflammation in obese patients likely results from incremental contribution from different cytokines and possibly other inflammatory mediators from within and outside the adipose tissues. It is possible that this obesity associated chronic inflammation is not predicted by a single mediator, but rather includes a large spectrum of possible profiles.</p>

<p>Background Severe mental illnesses (SMIs), i.e. major depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are associated with an elevated risk for the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders. Several factors have been associated with increased cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality in SMI, including lifestyle factors (smoking, inactivity, unhealthy diet), endocrine and immunologic alterations; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully uncovered. It is now well accepted that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) promotes the development of cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part by inflammatory and metabolic functions. Methods This paper reviews studies concerning VAT, with special focus on intra-abdominal and pericardial adipose tissue, in SMI. Results In patients with SMI, several studies have been performed concerning VAT. Most of these studies reported alterations of VAT particularly in patients with major depression and schizophrenia, independent of body weight and body mass index. Some of the studies also reported an increased cardiometabolic risk. Conclusion Patients with SMI are at increased risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders, and display increased amounts of VAT. As studies so far were mainly performed on patients before the onset of cardiometabolic disorders, VAT may serve as a biomarker for patients with SMI to assess cardiometabolic risks beyond established risk scores. Further, interventions aiming at reducing VAT in SMI are highly recommended in long-term multimodal treatment plans.</p>

Our goal is to decipher the contribution of human AT microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) in the maintenance of fatty acid (FA) fluxes and the impact of senescence on their function.We used freshly isolated primary microvascular ECs from human AT. Our data identified the endothelial FA handling machinery including FATPs (FA transport proteins) FATP1, FATP3, FATP4, and CD36 as well as FABP4 (FA binding protein 4). We showed that PPAR<U+03B3> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) regulates the expression of FATP1, CD36, and FABP4 and is a major regulator of FA uptake in human AT EC (hATEC). We provided evidence that endothelial PPAR<U+03B3> activity is modulated by senescence. Indeed, the positive regulation of FA transport by PPAR<U+03B3> agonist was abolished, whereas the emergence of an inflammatory response was favored in senescent hATEC. This was associated with the retention of nuclear FOXO1 (forkhead box protein O1), whereas nuclear PPAR<U+03B3> translocation was impaired.</AbstractText>: We used freshly isolated primary microvascular ECs from human AT.

<p>BACKGROUND: The therapeutic efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) has been investigated for numerous clinical indications, including autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Less is known using the crude adipose product called stromal vascular fraction (SVF) as therapy, although our previous studies demonstrated greater efficacy at late-stage disease compared to ASCs in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse, a model of multiple sclerosis. In this study, SVF cells and ASCs were administered during the pathogenic progression, designated as early disease, to elucidate immunomodulatory mechanisms when high immune cell activities associated with autoimmune signaling occur. These implications are essential for clinical translation when considering timing of administration for cell therapies.METHODS: We investigated the effects of SVF cells and ASCs by analyzing the spleens, peripheral blood, and central nervous system tissues throughout the course of EAE disease following administration of SVF cells, ASCs, or vehicle. In vitro, immunomodulatory potentials of SVF cells and ASCs were measured when exposed to EAE-derived splenocytes.RESULTS: Interestingly, treatment with SVF cells and ASCs transiently enhanced the severity of disease directly after administration, substantiating this critical immunomodulatory signaling. More importantly, it was only the EAE mice treated with SVF cells that were able to overcome the advancing pathogenesis and showed improvements by the end of the study. The frequency of lesions in spinal cords following SVF treatment correlated with diminished activities of the T helper type 1 cells, known effector cells of this disease. Co-cultures with splenocytes isolated from EAE mice revealed transcripts of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-ß, known promoters of regulatory T cells, that were greatly expressed in SVF cells compared to ASCs, and expression levels of signaling mediators related to effector T cells were insignificant in both SVF cells and ASCs.CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence, to date, to elucidate a mechanism of action of SVF treatment in an inflammatory, autoimmune disease. Our data supports key immunomodulatory signaling between cell therapies and T cells in this T cell-mediated disease. Together, treatment with SVF mediated immunomodulatory effects that diminished effector cell activities, promoted regulatory T cells, and reduced neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) refers to narrowing of the peripheral arteries and atherosclerosis is the most important cause. In patients with PAD, revascularization is the preferred therapeutic strategy; nonetheless several patients are not deemed candidates for it due to advanced disease or several comorbidities. The main target of therapeutic angiogenesis is to promote development of new arterial vessels and improve perfusion of ischemic tissue. Angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), administered intramuscularly or intra-arterially, have been shown to promote angiogenesis and development of collateral vasculature in preclinical studies. However, clinical studies failed to confirm their efficacy in ulcer healing and prevention of amputation, among patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia (CLI). Autologous progenitor cell therapy with bone marrow or adipose-derived progenitor cells administered intra-arterially or intra-muscularly, was shown to improve claudication symptoms and ankle-brachial index in small studies. However, subsequent randomized controlled studies did not demonstrate any beneficial effects of stem cell therapy on amputation rates and survival. Although, therapeutic angiogenesis remains an area of interest in PAD with several ongoing studies of investigational therapies, so far the use of these strategies in clinical practice has not been successful.</p>

<p>Acute medial dissection of aorta can occur in the context of a sudden and unexpected death. For medico-legal reasons it is important to estimate as accurately the histological age of dissections. We evaluated the additional value of a systematic application of immunohistochemistry, compared with conventional histology only, in determining chronological steps of injury and repair. Thirty two paraffin embedded specimens of aortic dissection were retrospectively allocated to one of four defined stages: acute (I), subacute (II), early organizing (III) and scarring (IV) using Hematoxylin and Eosin and Elastica van Gieson stained sections. Subsequent immunohistochemically staining was performed with the following markers: (myeloperoxidase (neutrophils), citrullinated-Histone 3 (neutrophil extracellular traps), CD68 (macrophages), CD3 (T-cells), CD31 and CD34 (endothelial cells), and smooth muscle actin. Immune stained sections were scored semi-quantitatively. Histologically, five cases were identified as stage I, 16 as II, 7 as III and 4 as IV. Additional immunostaining for smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells altered the classification in 25% of cases (all in groups II and III). Immunostaining and semi-quantitative grading of involvement of neutrophils, macrophages and NETs also provided specific distribution patterns over the 4 age categories, including unexpected involvement of the peri adventitial fat tissue. In conclusion, it appears that semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry of resident vascular wall cells, inflammatory cells and NETS represents a useful adjunct in detailed histopathological grading of the chronological age of aortic dissections.</p>

<p>Obesity-related heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an important phenotype prevalent in the community, especially in people with metabolic disorders (e.g., dyslipidemia, diabetes). These individuals exhibit a marked expansion of plasma volume, but ventricular distensibility is limited, most likely as a result of cardiac microvascular rarefaction acting in concert with myocardial and pericardial fibrosis. Consequently, the increase in plasma volume causes a disproportionate increase in cardiac filling pressures, leading to heart failure, even though systolic ejection is not impaired. The features of this syndrome appear to be related (in part) to the overproduction of adipocyte-derived cell-signaling molecules, including aldosterone and neprilysin. The resulting sodium retention and plasma volume expansion is exacerbated by their mutual actions to promote cardiac and systemic inflammation and fibrosis. Inhibitors of aldosterone, neprilysin, and the sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2) can ameliorate the plasma volume expansion and pro-inflammatory and profibrotic pathways, potentially opposing the action of diverse adipocytokines. All 3 classes of drugs can reduce the quantity of visceral adipose tissue and ameliorate its abnormal biological properties. This mechanistic framework is supported by the results of large-scale randomized trials with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and SGLT2 inhibitors and is being further tested in an ongoing large-scale trial of neprilysin inhibition. The promise of using mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, neprilysin inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors (alone or in combination) in the management of obesity-related HFpEF suggests that physicians might finally have a phenotype of HFpEF that they can understand and treat.</p>

<p>Obesity occurs when excess energy accumulates in white adipose tissue (WAT), whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is specialized in dissipating energy through thermogenesis, potently counteracts obesity. White adipocytes can be converted to thermogenic “brown-like” cells (beige cells; WAT browning) under various stimuli, such as cold exposure. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial energy sensor that regulates energy metabolism in multiple tissues. However, the role of AMPK in adipose tissue function, especially in the WAT browning process, is not fully understood. To illuminate the effect of adipocyte AMPK on energy metabolism, we generated Adiponectin-Cre-driven adipose tissue-specific AMPK a1/a2 KO mice (AKO). These AKO mice were cold intolerant and their inguinal WAT displayed impaired mitochondrial integrity and biogenesis, and reduced expression of thermogenic markers upon cold exposure. High-fat-diet (HFD)-fed AKO mice exhibited increased adiposity and exacerbated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis and impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Meanwhile, energy expenditure and oxygen consumption were markedly decreased in the AKO mice both in basal conditions and after stimulation with a ß3-adrenergic receptor agonist, CL 316,243. In contrast, we found that in HFD-fed obese mouse model, chronic AMPK activation by A-769662 protected against obesity and related metabolic dysfunction. A-769662 alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance and reduced body weight gain and WAT expansion. Notably, A-769662 increased energy expenditure and cold tolerance in HFD-fed mice. A-769662 treatment also induced the browning process in the inguinal fat depot of HFD-fed mice. Likewise, A-769662 enhanced thermogenesis in differentiated inguinal stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells via AMPK signaling pathway. In summary, a lack of adipocyte AMPKa induced thermogenic impairment and obesity in response to cold and nutrient-overload, respectively, whereas chronic AMPK activation by A-769662 promoted WAT browning in inguinal WAT and protected against HFD-induced obesity and related metabolic dysfunction. These findings reveal a vital role for adipocyte AMPK in regulating the browning process in inguinal WAT and in maintaining energy homeostasis, which suggests that the targeted activation of adipocyte AMPK may be a promising strategy for anti-obesity therapy.</p>

<p>Postoperative bleeding with its important socioeconomic cost is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. It causes hemodynamic instability, increases blood loss, and multiplies the number of transfusions required. Especially in vascular or aortic surgery, postoperative bleeding can become a life-threatening complication due to anticoagulant or antiaggregation preoperative status or postoperative coagulation dysfunction after a high level of heparinization. Presently described is the case of a patient who underwent an aortic valve and ascending aorta replacement. A simple but effective method to achieve hemostasis, designed particularly for aortic surgery and the use of Dacron grafts, is presented. No residual adherence or contraindications exist, and it can potentially be applied to any kind of surgical process. This method offers a cheap, biocompatible, and highly effective means to achieve complete hemostasis without the use of extra sutures, or expensive synthetic or allogeneic hemostatic agents or sealants.</p>

<p>Growth factors are the key elements in wound healing signaling for cell migration, differentiation and proliferation. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), one of the most studied sources of growth factors, has demonstrated to promote wound healing in vitro and in vivo. Adipose tissue is an alternative source of growth factors. Through a simple lipoaspirate method, adipose derived growth factor-rich preparation (adipose tissue extract; ATE) can be obtained. The authors set out to compare the effects of these two growth factor sources in cell proliferation and migration (scratch) assays of keratinocyte, fibroblast, endothelial and adipose derived stem cells. Growth factors involved in wound healing were measured: keratinocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, interleukin 6, platelet-derived growth factor beta, tumor necrosis factor alfa, transforming growth factor beta and vascular endothelial growth factor. PRP showed higher growth factor concentrations, except for keratinocyte growth factor, that was present in adipose tissue in greater quantities. This was reflected in vitro, where ATE significantly induced proliferation of keratinocytes at day 6 (p &lt; 0.001), compared to plasma and control. Similarly, ATE-treated fibroblast and adipose stem cell cultures showed accelerated migration in scratch assays. Moreover, both sources showed accelerated keratinocyte migration. Adipose tissue preparation has an inductive effect in wound healing by proliferation and migration of cells involved in wound closure. Adipose tissue preparation appears to offer the distinct advantage of containing the adequate quantities of growth factors that induce cell activation, proliferation and migration, particularly in the early phase of wound healing.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) expansion is associated with angiogenesis. Although, activation of lipolysis by exercise induces adipocyte hypotrophy and reduction of fat mass, it is poorly understood whether exercise regulates angiogenesis by altering angiogenic gene expression in WAT. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 6 weeks voluntary wheel running exercise on angiogenic gene expression in adipose tissues. Male C57BL/6J mice performed voluntary wheel running for 6 weeks. At 24 hr after the last exercise training, tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (Sol), epididymal WAT (eWAT), inguinal WAT (iWAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were isolated and then the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), angiopoietin1 (Ang1), Ang2, platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) and their corresponding receptors were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In skeletal muscles, VEGFA expression was upregulated in TA and Sol and PDDGF-B expression was increased in Sol after exercise training. In eWAT, the expressions of VEGFA and Flk-1 were dramatically downregulated, whereas Ang2 and PDGFRß was upregulated after exercise training. In iWAT, VEGF expression was increased with the downregulation of Ang1. However, there was no alteration of any of these genes in BAT. These results suggest that angiogenic gene expression is altered by exercise training and voluntary wheel running regulates VEGFA, Ang1, and Ang2 expressions in a fat depot specific manner.</p>

<p>Whereas the blood microvasculature constitutes a biological barrier to the action of blood-borne insulin on target tissues, the lymphatic microvasculature might act as a barrier to subcutaneously administrated insulin reaching the circulation. Here, we evaluate the interaction of insulin with primary microvascular endothelial cells of lymphatic [human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLEC)] and blood [human adipose microvascular endothelial cells (HAMEC)] origin, derived from human dermal and adipose tissues, respectively. HDLEC express higher levels of insulin receptor and signal in response to insulin as low as 2.5 nM, while HAMEC only activate signaling at 100 nM (a dose that blood vessels do not normally encounter). Low insulin acts specifically through the insulin receptor, while supraphysiological insulin acts through both the IR and insulin growth factor-1 receptor. At supraphysiological or injection site-compatible doses pertinent to lymphatic microvessels, insulin enters HAMEC and HDLEC via fluid-phase endocytosis. Conversely, at physiologically circulating doses (0.2 nM) pertinent to blood microvessels, insulin enters HAMEC through a receptor-mediated process requiring IR autophosphorylation but not downstream insulin signaling. At physiological doses, internalized insulin is barely degraded and is instead released intact to the extracellular medium. In conclusion, we document for the first time the mechanism of interaction of insulin with lymphatic endothelial cells, which may be relevant to insulin absorption during therapeutic injections. Furthermore, we describe distinct action and uptake routes for insulin at physiological and supraphysiological doses in blood microvascular endothelial cells, providing a potential explanation for previously conflicting studies on endothelial insulin uptake.</p>

<p>Dermal substitutes are frequently used for the initial coverage of extensive skin defects. The seeding of these implants with adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments (ad-MVF) has recently been shown to accelerate their vascularization and incorporation. In the present study we analyzed whether these processes are affected by a thromboprophylactic therapy with the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin (enox). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)<sup>+</sup> ad-MVF were isolated from enox- (8 mg/kg s.c.) and vehicle-treated (0.9% NaCl s.c.) (C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J mice and seeded onto Integra matrices. Subsequently, these were implanted into full-thickness skin defects within dorsal skinfold chambers of enox- and vehicle-treated C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Repetitive stereomicroscopy and intravital fluorescence microscopy over 2 weeks as well as histological and immunohistochemical analyses on day 14 revealed that enox does not inhibit the reassembly of ad-MVF into new microvascular networks. In addition, treatment with the anticoagulative compound did not promote implant-induced hemorrhage formation. Accordingly, Integra matrices in enox- and vehicle-treated animals exhibited a comparable final microvessel density, fraction of GFP<sup>+</sup> blood vessels originating from seeded ad-MVF, collagen fiber content, and epithelialization. These novel findings demonstrate that the seeding of dermal substitutes with ad-MVF may be applied also during thromboprophylactic therapy without affecting implant vascularization and bleeding risk.</p>

<p>The prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide. One-thirds of world population is suffering from the deleterious effects of excessive fat and adipose tissue in their body. At the same time, the average life expectancy is becoming higher and higher every decade. Therefore, living healthy and longer is the dream for everyone. Simply being obese is not the primary cause for the consequence of obesity; rather, the depot where the fat is accumulated, is the primary key for the deleterious effects of obesity. Results from historical research suggest that visceral fat increases the risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, not subcutaneous fat. Therefore, body mass index (BMI), which reflects body weight relative to height might not reflect the appropriate size of metabolic burden of fat in our body. In contrast, waist circumference, which reflects abdominal obesity, would mirror the metabolic burden of fat better than BMI. Visceral fat is the marker of ectopic fat accumulation. In this review, I will introduce my researches mainly involved in uncovering the clues to the link between metabolic health and cardiovascular disease.</p>

The role of the gut microbiota was investigated by orally administering a mixture of antibiotics (ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole). Glucose homeostasis was assessed via i.p. glucose and insulin tolerance tests.Mice lacking ANGPTL4 displayed an increase in body weight gain, visceral adipose tissue mass, visceral adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity and visceral adipose tissue inflammation compared with WT mice. However, they also unexpectedly had markedly improved glucose tolerance, which was accompanied by elevated insulin levels. Loss of ANGPTL4 did not affect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets. Since the gut microbiota have been suggested to influence insulin secretion, and because ANGPTL4 has been proposed to link the gut microbiota to host metabolism, we hypothesised a potential role of the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota composition was significantly different between Angptl4<sup>-/-</sup> mice and WT mice. Interestingly, suppression of the gut microbiota using antibiotics largely abolished the differences in glucose tolerance and insulin levels between WT and Angptl4<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</AbstractText>: mice.Despite increasing visceral fat mass, inactivation of ANGPTL4 improves glucose tolerance, at least partly via a gut microbiota-dependent mechanism.</AbstractText>: Despite increasing visceral fat mass, inactivation of ANGPTL4 improves glucose tolerance, at least partly via a gut microbiota-dependent mechanism.</p>

<p>Tissue engineering strategies to treat patients with volumetric muscle loss (VML) aim to recover the structure and contractile function of lost muscle tissue. Here, we assessed the capacity of novel electrospun fibrin hydrogel scaffolds seeded with murine myoblasts to regenerate the structure and function of damaged muscle within VML defects to the mouse tibialis anterior muscle. The electrospun fibrin scaffolds provide pro-myogenic alignment and stiffness cues, myomimetic hierarchical structure, suturability, and scale-up capabilities. Myoblast-seeded scaffolds enabled remarkable muscle regeneration with high myofiber and vascular densities after 2 and 4 weeks, mimicking that of native skeletal muscle, while acellular scaffolds lacked muscle regeneration. Both myoblast-seeded and acellular scaffolds fully recovered muscle contractile function to uninjured values after 2 and 4 weeks. Electrospun scaffolds pre-vascularized with co-cultured human endothelial cells and human adipose-derived stem cells implanted into VML defects for 2 weeks anastomosed with host vasculature and were perfused with host red blood cells. These data demonstrate the significant potential of electrospun fibrin scaffolds seeded with myoblasts to fully regenerate the structure and function of volumetric muscle defects and these scaffolds offer a promising treatment option for patients with VML.</p>

<p>Bleomycin (BLM) has been reported to induce lung inflammation and fibrosis in human and mice and showed genetic susceptibility. Interestingly, the C57BL/6 (B6) mice had prominent mediastinal fat-associated lymphoid cluster (MFALCs) under healthy condition, and showed susceptibility to development of lung fibrosis following BLM administration. However, the pathogenesis of lung lesion progression, and their correlation with MFALC morphologies, remain to be clarified. To investigate the correlations between MFALC structures and lung injuries in B6 mice, histopathological examination of mediastinal fat tissues and lungs was examined at 7 and 21<U+2009>days (d) following a single 50<U+2009>µL intranasal (i.n.) instillation of either BLM sulfate (5<U+2009>mg/kg) (BLM group) or phosphate-buffered saline (control group). The lung fibrosis was examined by Masson’s trichrome (MT) stain of paraffin sections and mRNA expression levels of Col1a1, Col3a1, and Acta2 in different frozen lung samples. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for CD3, B220, Iba1, Gr1, BrdU, LYVE-1, and peripheral node addressin (PNAd) was performed to detect T- and B-cells, macrophages, granulocytes, proliferating cells, lymph vessels (LVs), and high endothelial venules (HEVs). We found that MFALCs were more abundant in the BLM group as compared to the control group. The lung of BLM group developed pneumonitis with severe cellular infiltrations at 7<U+2009>days and significant collagen deposition (MT) and higher expression of Col1a1, and Col3a1 at 21<U+2009>days post-administration. Numerous immune cells, proliferating cells, HEVs, and LVs were observed in both MFALCs and lungs of the BLM group. Interestingly, PNAd<U+2009>+<U+2009>HEVs were observed in the lungs of the BLM group, but not the control group. Moreover, numerous Gr1<U+2009>+<U+2009>polymorphonuclear and mononuclear-like ring cells were found in the MFALCs and lungs of the BLM group. Interestingly, flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant increase of B-cell populations within the MFALCs of BLM group suggesting a potential proliferative induction of B-cells following inflammation. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between quantitative parameters of these immune cells in both the lungs and MFALCs. Thus, we suggest a potentially important role for MFALCs and HEVs in the progression of lung disease, especially in inflammatory lung disease.</p>

<p>Natriuretic peptides are a group of hormones including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C type (CNP), urodilatin and guanilyn. ANP (half-life: 2-4 min), is secreted by the atrium, BNP (half-life: 20 min) by the ventricle, CNP by the vascular endothelium, urodilatin by the kidney and guanylin by the intestine. These natriuretic peptides prevent water and salt retention through renal action, vasodilatation and hormonal inhibition of aldosterone, vasopressin and cortisol. These peptides also have a recently demonstrated metabolic effect through an increase of lipolysis, thermogenesis, beta cell proliferation and muscular sensitivity to insulin. Blood levels of these natriuretic peptides depend on “active NPR-A receptors/clearance NPR-C receptors”, the last ones being abundant on adipocytes. Therefore, natriuretic peptides act as adipose tissue regulator and constitute a link between blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. They are used as markers and treatment of cardiac failure. Other applications are on going. BNP and NT-proBNP (inactive portion de la pro-hormone) are used as markers of cardiac failure since they have a longer half-life than ANP. BNP decrease is quicker and more important than that one of NT-ProBNP in case of improvement of cardiac failure. Chronic renal insufficiency and beta-blockers increase BNP levels. BNP measurement is useless under treatment with neprilysine inhibitors such as sacubitril, one of the neutral endopeptidases involved in catabolism of natriuretic peptides. The association sacubitril/valsartan is a new treatment of chronic cardiac failure, acting through the decrease of ANP catabolism.</p>

<p>Obesity-related changes in adipose tissue leukocytes, in particular adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and dendritic cells (ATDCs), are implicated in metabolic inflammation, insulin resistance, and altered regulation of adipocyte function. We evaluated stromal cell and white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion dynamics with high fat diet (HFD) feeding for 3-56 days, quantifying ATMs, ATDCs, endothelial cells (ECs), and preadipocytes (PAs) in visceral epididymal WAT and subcutaneous inguinal WAT. To better understand mechanisms of the early response to obesity, we evaluated ATM proliferation and lipid accumulation. ATMs, ATDCs, and ECs increased with rapid WAT expansion, with ATMs derived primarily from a CCR2-independent resident population. WAT expansion stimulated proliferation in resident ATMs and ECs, but not CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs or ATDCs. ATM proliferation was unperturbed in Csf2- and Rag1-deficient mice with WAT expansion. Additionally, ATM apoptosis decreased with WAT expansion, and proliferation and apoptosis reverted to baseline with weight loss. Adipocytes reached maximal hypertrophy at 28 days of HFD, coinciding with a plateau in resident ATM accumulation and the appearance of lipid-laden CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs in visceral epididymal WAT. ATM increases were proportional to tissue expansion and adipocyte hypertrophy, supporting adipocyte-mediated regulation of resident ATMs. The appearance of lipid-laden CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs at peak adipocyte size supports a role in responding to ectopic lipid accumulation within adipose tissue. In contrast, ATDCs increase independently of proliferation and may be derived from circulating precursors. These changes precede and establish the setting in which large-scale adipose tissue infiltration of CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs, inflammation, and adipose tissue dysfunction contributes to insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Clinical implication of a high ankle-brachial index (ABI) is not well known. Based on our previous study, we suspected that body composition may be a determinant of a high ABI and may consequently modulate the clinical significance of a high ABI. Datasets of two studies with independent cohorts, the anti-aging study cohort (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1765) and the Nagahama study cohort (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8,039), were analyzed in this study, in which appendicular muscle mass was measured by computed tomography and bioelectrical impedance analysis, respectively. Brachial and ankle blood pressures were measured using a cuff-oscillometric method. In the anti-aging study cohort, thigh muscle area (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.387, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001), but not fat area, showed a strong positive association with the ABI independent of the body mass index (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.662) and other possible covariates, including systolic brachial blood pressure (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.054), carotid hypertrophy (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.559), and arterial stiffness (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.102, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). This positive association was replicated in the Nagahama cohort. When the subjects were subdivided by the 75th percentiles of the ABI and appendicular muscle mass, multinomial logistic regression analysis identified insulin resistance as an independent determinant of an elevated ABI in subjects with normal muscle mass (coefficient<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.134, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.010), whereas insulin resistance was inversely associated with an elevated ABI in subjects with high muscle mass (coefficient<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.268, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). Appendicular muscle mass was a strong determinant of the ABI. The clinical background, particularly insulin resistance, of individuals with an elevated ABI may differ based on the amount of muscle mass.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: This study investigates the feasibility and clinical impact of the microdissected thin perforator skin flap strategy on bulky and deformed skin flaps during second-stage revision surgery.METHODS: Seventeen patients were selected and underwent the microdissected thin perforator skin flap technique to treat bulky and deformed skin flaps after free flap reconstruction between October 2013 and October 2015. Perforator vessels were isolated and protected under a microscope. Subdermal fat with a thickness of 4 mm to 7 mm was preserved, and excess adipose tissue was resected.RESULTS: No skin flap necrosis was observed after the operation in all 17 patients, and all wounds healed without complications. Patients were followed up for 3 to 24 months, with an average follow-up time of 10 months. The skin flaps maintain normal color and texture. Both appearance and function of the recipient sites were improved significantly.CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of microdissected thin perforator flap technique to further thin bulky skin flaps at the second stage can be effective in a single operation. The blood supply of all free flaps was preserved, with no evidence of necrosis or healing complications. This technique offers an effective approach for secondary thinning of bulky free flaps.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: To assist surgeons in identifying and preserving the parathyroid gland (PTG) in endoscopic thyroidectomy (ET), we have summarized the characteristics of the PTG and the surrounding tissues in ET by applying the Storz Professional Image Enhancement System (SPIES).METHODS: From November 2014 to May 2016, 182 patients with 613 suspected PTGs were included in our study. The shape, color, area, and density of surface blood vessels (SBVs); whether they were encapsulated with adipose tissue; and whether congestion was present during the operation were summarized. The <U+03BA> coefficient of interobserver agreement in assessing the area and the density of SBVs of suspected PTGs with and without Spectra A (SA) and Spectra B (SB) modalities were calculated. Multiple binary logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive value of different characteristics for detecting the PTG in ET with the application of SPIES.RESULTS: With visual identification and histopathological results as reference standards, 291 targeted tissues were identified as PTGs, 256 as adipose tissue, 43 as lymph nodes, and 23 as thyroid tissue. The <U+03BA> coefficients of interobserver agreement in assessing SBV density with or without the SA and SB modalities were 0.944<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.013 and 0.859<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.021, respectively, and those in assessing SBV area were 0.937<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.014 and 0.841<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.022, respectively. In the comparison between PTGs and other tissues, multiple binary logistic regression analysis revealed that shape, color, SBV density, congestion, and whether tissue was encapsulated with adipose tissue were independent predictive factors of PTGs.CONCLUSION: With the application of SPIES, the shape, color, density of SBVs, adipose tissue encapsulation, and congestion were independent factors that predicted PTGs in ET. The SA and SB modalities of SPIES could improve the reliability of SBV density and area classifications in targeted tissues.</p>

<p>A hibernoma is a benign soft tissue tumor consisting of brown adipose tissue. The tumors are mostly located in the thigh, back, and shoulder region. They are rarely found in the supraclavicular fossa. We report a 39-year-old woman who presented with a painless, slow-growing mass on the left supraclavicular fossa for nearly 15 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an inhomogeneous round mass with a slightly hyperintense signal on fat-suppression T2-weighted imaging that compressed the adjacent tissues and subclavian vessels. Computed tomography angiography indicated a rich blood flow signal. Postoperative histology confirmed the diagnosis of a hibernating tumor. Although comprehensive imaging is important in the determination of tumor for the size, location, and nature, computed tomography angiography provides clear indication of the vascularity of the tumor, which provides vital clinicopathologic data for surgeons.</p>

<p>Traditionally, it is believed that white adipose tissues serve as energy storage, heat insulation, and mechanical cushion, whereas non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in brown adipose tissue. Recent evidence revealed that adipose tissue secretes many types of cytokines, called as adipocytokines, which modulate glucose metabolism, lipid profile, appetite, fibrinolysis, blood pressure, and inflammation. Most of the arteries are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). PVAT has been thought to be simply a structurally supportive tissue for vasculature. However, recent studies showed that PVAT influences vasodilation and vasocontraction, suggesting that PVAT regulates vascular tone and diameter. Adipocytokines secreted from PVAT appear to have direct access to the adjacent arterial wall by diffusion or via vasa vasorum. In fact, PVAT around atherosclerotic lesions and mechanically-injured arteries displayed inflammatory cytokine profiles, suggesting that PVAT functions to promote vascular lesion formation. Many clinical studies revealed that increased accumulation of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), which surrounds coronary arteries, is associated with coronary artery disease. In this review article, we will summarize recent findings about potential roles of PVAT in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, particularly focusing on a series of basic and clinical studies from our laboratory.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of acute exercise on key factors regulating angiogenesis in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue Vegf-a messenger RNA expression was upregulated immediately after acute exercise (p &lt; 0.05) in rats consuming a high-fat diet, but was lower after exercise (p &lt; 0.05) in rats consuming a low-fat diet. Our working hypothesis is that acute exercise augments angiogenic signaling under conditions when adipose tissue is expanding, and with repeated exercise sessions these signals can accrue to enhance vascularization.</p>

<p>We performed the largest randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to date (N = 112, 12-week intervention) to investigate the effects and safety of resveratrol supplementation on liver fat content and cardiometabolic risk parameters in overweight and obese and insulin-resistant subjects. At baseline the variability in liver fat content was very large, ranging from 0.09% to 37.55% (median, 7.12%; interquartile range, 3.85%-12.94%). Mean (SD) liver fat content was 9.22 (6.85) % in the placebo group and 9.91 (7.76) % in the resveratrol group. During the study liver fat content decreased in the placebo group (-0.7%) but not in the resveratrol group (-0.03%) (differences between groups: P = .018 for the intention-to-treat [ITT] population; N = 54, resveratrol, N = 54, placebo and P = .0077 for the per protocol [PP] population). No effects of resveratrol supplementation on cardiometabolic risk parameters were observed. Resveratrol supplementation was well tolerated and safe. In conclusion, these data suggest that resveratrol supplementation is safe and that it does not considerably impact liver fat content or cardiometabolic risk parameters in humans.</p>

<p>Background/aim: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the thickness of the epicardial adipose tissue and its association with the degree of coronary artery disease in a group of autopsied cases. Materials and methods: A number of 79 cases were included in the study. Five preestablished incisions of the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) were made on each of the hearts. These five points were next to/on the path of the major coronary vessels. The degree of coronary atherosclerosis was evaluated during the autopsy. Results: The results revealed the greatest thickness of the EAT on the incision made on the anterior and posterior wall of the right ventricle. EAT was thicker in cases presenting atherosclerosis degree I or II in two of the coronary arteries, the left circumflex artery and left main artery; on the left anterior descending artery, higher EAT thickness associated with fourth degree atherosclerosis. Conclusion: Epicardial adipose tissue thickness was greater at the incision points situated on the right side of the heart. Greater EAT thickness was associated significantly with early atherosclerosis development in three of the coronary arteries (LCx, LMA, LADA).</p>

<p>The dysregulation of adipokine secretion owing to adiposopathy can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-related disorders. Being that exercise is an advised strategy against obesity-induced adiposopathy, we aimed to analyze the role of physical exercise as a preventive and therapeutic strategy against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced adipokine and ghrelin alterations. Rats were pair-fed the Lieber De Carli standard diet (S, 35 Kcal% fat) or HFD (71 Kcal% fat) over 17 weeks. Animals were assigned into four groups as follows: standard diet sedentary (SS), standard diet voluntary physical activity (SVPA), high-fat diet sedentary (HS), and high-fat diet voluntary physical activity (HVPA). After 9 weeks of dietary treatment, half of the SS and HS animals were submitted to an 8-week endurance training program, standard diet endurance training (SET), and high-fat-diet endurance training (HET) groups, maintaining the respective diets. Although there were no changes in body weight, HFD increased visceral adiposity, percentage of large adipocytes, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1a, and leptin contents in epididymal adipose tissue (eWAT) and decreased plasma content of adiponectin (AdipQ). Both VPA and ET decreased visceral adiposity and percentage of large adipocytes in HFD-fed animals, but ET also increased the percentage of small- to medium-sized adipocytes. VPA increased plasma growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) and decreased leptin protein in HVPA group. ET decreased plasma insulin and leptin levels and eWAT HIF-1a and leptin expression in HET group. Moreover, ET improved insulin sensitivity, plasma high molecular weight, and AdipQ and ghrelin levels and increased eWAT and GHS-R expression. Our data suggest that exercise, particularly ET, reverted adiposopathy and related endocrine alterations induced by an isocaloric HFD pair-fed diet.</p>

<p>Papillary endothelial hyperplasia (PEH) is a rare non-neoplastic exuberant organizing hematoma that can closely mimic angiosarcoma due to a resemblance to malignant anastomosing blood vessels. It could be particularly difficult to distinguish PEH from angiosarcoma in breast core needle biopsies. We identified all cases of these lesions diagnosed on core needle biopsy in order to identify clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features that could prove helpful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Four cases of PEH and 4 cases of angiosarcoma were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 62 for PEH and 33 for primary angiosarcoma. All cases of PEH formed small masses with circumscribed or lobulated margins by imaging (mean size 0.9 cm). In 3 cases, the masses were difficult or impossible to identify after the biopsy. Angiosarcomas presented as larger masses with ill-defined margins (mean size 2.8 cm) that were unchanged in size after biopsy. PEH was surrounded by adipose tissue, whereas angiosarcoma invaded into fibrous stroma and involved lobules. The pseudopapillary structures of PEH were composed mainly of collagen, and thus, additional histologic stains for fibrin were not helpful for diagnosis. The 4 patients with PEH received no further treatment and are alive and disease-free at 2-11 years of follow-up. In contrast, the patients with angiosarcoma underwent mastectomy and chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Two of the patients with angiosarcoma died 3 years after diagnosis and the other 2 patients are alive without disease at 5 and 6 years. Therefore, distinguishing PEH and angiosarcoma is essential for appropriate management. This is the first series to compare these lesions on core needle biopsy and the first to note important clinical, imaging, and histologic differences that aid in making a diagnosis of PEH with confidence on breast core needle biopsy.</p>

<p>AIMS: Cell communication between mesenchymal stem cells and blood vessel cells are crucial for bone repair. We have previously shown that the phyto-molecule icariin significantly promoted osteogenic differentiation of rat adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between icariin induced osteogenic differentiation of ASCs and angiogenesis of rat endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Besides, we used icariin doped 45S5 Bioglass seeded with ASCs to promote bone healing in rat calvarial bone defect models.MAIN METHODS: The conditioned medium from undifferentiated ASCs (ASCs-CM) and icariin induced ASCs (Icariin-ASCs-CM) was obtained and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein secretion level was measured. The angiogenic capacity and molecular mechanism of ASC-CM and Icariin-ASCs-CM on rat EPCs was analyzed. Rat calvarial bone defect models were established and treated with scaffolds implantation. Micro-CT imaging, histological and immunohistological staining were performed on the isolated specimens at 12<U+202F>weeks post-surgery.SIGNIFICANCE: Implantation of Icariin/45S5 Bioglass seeded with rat ASCs could obviously promote both osteogenesis and angiogenesis and therefore represents an ideal candidate bone substitutes for bone repair and regeneration.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is commonly categorized into three types with distinct functions, phenotypes, and anatomical localizations. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the major energy store; the largest depots of WAT are found in subcutaneous or intravisceral sites. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for energy dissipation during cold-exposure (i.e., non-shivering thermogenesis) and is primarily located in the interscapular region. Beige or brite (brown-in-white) adipose tissue can be found interspersed in WAT and can attain a brown-like phenotype. These three types of tissues also have endocrine functions and play major roles in whole body metabolism especially in obesity and its co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease. Over the last years, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has emerged as an adipose organ with endocrine and paracrine functions. Pro and anti-inflammatory agents released by PVAT affect vascular health, and are implicated in the inflammatory aspects of atherosclerosis. PVAT shares several of the defining characteristics of brown adipose tissue, including its cellular morphology and expression of thermogenic genes characteristic for brown adipocytes. However, PVATs from different vessels are phenotypically different, and significant developmental differences exist between PVAT and other adipose tissues. Whether PVAT represents classical BAT, beige adipose tissue, or WAT with changing characteristics, is unclear. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on how PVAT relates to other types of adipose tissue, both in terms of functionality, developmental origins, and its role in obesity-related cardiovascular disease and inflammation.</p>

<p>While therapeutic modulation of miRNAs provides a promising approach for numerous diseases, the promiscuous nature of miRNAs raises concern over detrimental off-target effects. miR-33 has emerged as a likely target for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the deleterious effects of long-term anti-miR-33 therapies and predisposition of miR-33<sup>-/-</sup> mice to obesity and metabolic dysfunction exemplify the possible pitfalls of miRNA-based therapies. Our work provides an in-depth characterization of miR-33<sup>-/-</sup> mice and explores the mechanisms by which loss of miR-33 promotes insulin resistance in key metabolic tissues. Contrary to previous reports, our data do not support a direct role for SREBP-1-mediated lipid synthesis in promoting these effects. Alternatively, in adipose tissue of miR-33<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we observe increased pre-adipocyte proliferation, enhanced lipid uptake, and impaired lipolysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the driving force behind these abnormalities is increased food intake, which can be prevented by pair feeding with wild-type animals.</p>

<p>AIM: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is in intimate contact with the vessel wall and extravascular PVAT-derived inflammatory mediators may adversely influence atherosclerotic plaque formation and stability through outside-to-inside signaling. We sought to investigate the role of PVAT on the atheroma development in an experimental animal model of metabolic syndrome (MS) associated with oxidative stress and low-grade inflammatory state. We also studied the effect of pioglitazone an insulin sensitizer, on the aortic wall and its surrounding PVAT, considering a bi-directional communication between both layers.CONCLUSION: Our results support the fact that PVAT contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease by underlying mechanisms elicited by “outside-in” signaling. Treatment with pioglitazone may offer a new effect on the whole vessel wall, promoting the stability of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.</p>

<p>New blood vessel formation is essential for tissue regeneration to deliver oxygen and nutrients and to maintain tissue metabolism. In the field of tissue engineering, in vitro fabrication of new artificial vessels has been a longstanding challenge. Here we developed a technique to reconstruct a microvascular system using a polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin nanofibrous structure and a co-culture system. Using a simple electrospinning process, we fabricated three-dimensional mesh scaffolds to support the sprouting of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) along the electrospun nanofiber. The co-culture with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) supported greater sprouting of endothelial cells (ECs). In a two-dimensional culture system, angiogenic cell assembly produced more effective direct intercellular interactions and paracrine signaling from ADSCs to assist in the vascular formation of ECs, compared to the influence of growth factor. Although vascular endothelial growth factor and sphingosine-1-phosphate were present during the culture period, the presence of ADSCs was the most important factor for the construction of a cell-assembled structure in the two-dimensional culture system. On the contrary, HUVECs co-cultured on PCL/gelatin nanofiber scaffolds produced mature and functional microvessel and luminal structures with a greater expression of vascular markers, including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and podocalyxin. Furthermore, both angiogenic factors and cellular interactions with ADSCs through direct contact and paracrine molecules contributed to the formation of enhanced engineered blood vessel structures. It is expected that the co-culture system of HUVECs and ADSCs on bioengineered PCL/gelatin nanofibrous scaffolds will promote robust and functional microvessel structures and will be valuable for the regeneration of tissue with restored blood vessels.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Obesity and metabolic syndrome are disorders that correlate with the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and cytokine production, to which Toll like receptors (TLR) contribute. Exercise may act as an anti-inflammatory modulator, but there is no consensus about the role of the TLR in this tuning. The present styudy aims to systematically review the current evidence on exercise-induced TLR regulation in animals and humans suffering from obesity and metabolic syndrome.METHODS: Pubmed and Scopus databases were searched for publications from 1990 to September 2015. Search terms included: “Toll like Receptor”, “TLR”, “exercise”, “obesity”, “diabetes”, and “metabolic syndrome”. Elegibility criteria comprised: randomized control trials, cross-sectional and cohort studies; human or animal models with metabolic syndrome; any type of exercise; TLR expression measurement in any tissue by a clearly reported technique. The quality of selected studies was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black Quality Assessment Checklist. Data of study design; population; exercise type, timing and training elements; measurement technique, tissue analyzed and main outcome were extracted and categorized to facilitate data synthesis.RESULTS: 17 studies were included, of which 11 publications obtained a high, 5 a moderate and 1 a low score for quality assessment. A total of 8 human studies were analyzed: 6 studies used endurance continuous or interval training protocols, 1 study resistance training and the remaining study was performed following a marathon race. Blood cells were analyzed in seven studies, of which four studies sampled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), three analyzed whole blood and one study sampled skeletal muscle. Nine animal studies were included: 8 used endurance training and 1 acute aerobic exercise. A variety of tissues samples were explored such as PBMC, skeletal muscle, adipose, vascular and nervous tissue. Globally, the animal studies showed a marked tendency towards a down-regulation of TLR2 and 4 expression accompagnied with, a reduced activation of nuclear factorkappaB (NF-<U+03BA>B) signaling and cytokine production, and an improvement in insulin sensitivity and body composition.CONCLUSION: While animal studies showed a marked tendency towards TLR2 and 4 down-regulation after chronic endurance exercise, the current evidence in human is not sufficiently robust to conclude any role of TLR in the anti-inflammatory properties of exercise.</p>

<p>In addition to accumulation and metabolism of triglycerides, white adipose tissue is recognized as the active endocrine organ, whose dysfunction is associated with the development of a wide range of diseases. The secretome of adipocytes is represented by a wide range of adipokines, which vary in depot and sex-specific manner. In addition, adipokines have diverse biological effects, correlations with different metabolic features and functions. In this review, the data on biological effects, origin and the clinical significance of adipokines are discussed. The influence of adipokines on metabolism, sensitivity to insulin, vascular homeostasis, angiogenesis, repair, inflammation and immune cells are shown. Visceral adipose tissue accumulation is accompanied with adipocytes hypertrophy and overproduction of such proinflammatory and proaterogenic molecules like resistin, visfatin, vaspin, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 6, lipocalin, glypican 4, RBP4 etc. There is a tight correlation between these adipokines level and development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiometabolic complications and cancer. Thus, adipokines represent a group of informative biomarkers for the diagnostics of metabolic disorders and the prediction of the outcome of the wide range of diseases. The study of the effects and mechanisms of the action of adipokines is the basis for determining new targets for therapy.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular diseases remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family. We aimed to test whether adipose-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular pathology on injury.METHODS: DNA cloning, protein expression, purification, and N-terminal sequencing were applied to characterize FAM19A5. Adenovirus infection and siRNA transfection were performed to regulate FAM19A5 expression. Balloon and wire injury were performed in vivo on the rat carotid arteries and mouse femoral arteries, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, radioactive ligand-receptor binding assays, receptor internalization, and calcium mobilization assays were used to identify the functional receptor for FAM19A5.CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that a novel adipokine, FAM19A5, was capable of inhibiting postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling. Downregulation of FAM19A5 during obesity may trigger cardiometabolic diseases.</p>

<p>In natural tissues, the nutrition of cells and removal of waste products is facilitated by a dense capillary network which is generated during development. This perfusion system is also indispensable for tissue formation in vitro. Nutrition depending solely on diffusion is not sufficient to generate tissues of clinically relevant dimensions, which is a core aim in tissue engineering research. In this study, the establishment of a vascular network was investigated in a self-assembling approach employing endothelial and mural cells. The process of vascularization was analyzed in constructs based on a carrier matrix of decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS). A three-dimensional hydrogel containing Matrigel™, collagen, and respective cells was casted on top of the SIS. Various types of human endothelial cells (hECs), e.g. HUVECs, cardiac tissue ECs (hCECs), pulmonary artery ECs (hPAECs), and iPSC-derived ECs, were co-cultured with human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (hASCs) within the hydrogel. Analyzed hECs were able to self-assemble and form three-dimensional networks harboring small caliber lumens within the hydrogel constructs in the presence of hASCs as supporting cells. Additionally, microvessel assembling required exogenous growth factor supplementation. This study demonstrates the development of stable vascularized hydrogels applying hASCs as mural cells in combination with various types of hECs, paving the way for the generation of clinically applicable tissue engineered constructs.</p>

<p>Wound healing is a biological complex process that involves several cell types under the control and regulation of several growth factors and cytokines. There have been efforts to study the therapeutic effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-ß, vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor on chronic wounds. In addition, the effects of biomaterials such as nano-fibrous chitin and chitosan have been proven to be effective on wound healing. Furthermore, stem cell therapy using adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) has been developed as a new therapeutic method for wound repair and healing. In this review, we will summarize the role of stem cells; growth factors and biomaterials in wound healing and repair.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis is almost absent in intramyocardial coronary arteries, while epicardial coronary arteries may show extensive occlusive disease. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) expression has been implicated in atherogenesis. We aimed to investigate differences in arterial wall LOX-1 expression between human epicardial and intramyocardial coronary arteries.METHODS: Epicardial and intramyocardial total artery wall specimens were obtained from 13 male patients (aged 61.9 ± 10.3 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery due to 3-vessel coronary artery disease. LOX-1 expression was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: LOX-1 expression was significantly higher in the arterial wall of epicardial coronary arteries compared to intramyocardial coronary arteries. The LOX-1/GAPDH ratio was 0.48 ± 0.07 vs. 0.35 ± 0.03 (p &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may partially explain the atheroprotective effect of the intramyocardial course since arterial wall LOX-1 expression was lower in intramyocardial arteries and higher in epicardial coronary arteries.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Obesity and hypertension pose a big threat to public health. Targeting the prehypertension stage to evaluate the vascular damage due to obesity can help us to plan early interventions.STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.METHODS: This study  as a part of the medical heath checkup program was conducted by the Medical College in Puducherry, India on all medical students of age group 18-25 years. Blood pressure (BP) recordings and body mass index (BMI) were classified into following four groups: Group1: Normotensives with normal BMI (n=109); Group 2: Normotensives with higher BMI (n=89); Group 3: Prehypertensive subjects with normal BMI (n=50); and Group 4: Prehypertensive subjects with higher BMI (n=99). Arterial stiffness, body fat composition, and lipid profile were evaluated. Correlation of arterial stiffness indices with BMI, BP, body fat, visceral fat, lipid profile were done using Pearson’s correlation and the contribution of BMI to arterial stiffness was assessed using univariate regression analysis.RESULTS: BMI, arterial stiffness, body fat, visceral fat, total cholesterol and total triglyceride showed a significant increase in prehypertensive group with higher BMI as compared to other groups. BMI showed significant correlation with arterial stiffness (P&lt;0.0001) and found to be an independent contributing factor for arterial stiffness development in prehypertensives.CONCLUSIONS: Vascular damage was seen in the prehypertensive stage itself and was more pronounced in individuals with higher BMI.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Wound healing is a complex process that relies on growth factors and stimulation of angiogenesis. Tissue engineering materials composed of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and silk fibroin (SF)/chitosan (CS) may be able to solve this problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the wound-healing potential of ADSC-seeded SF/CS in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased and randomly assigned into 3 groups: a control group (no graft), a group treated with SF/CS film graft, and a group treated with ADSC-seeded SF/CS graft. The number of animals in each group was 12. Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. A cutaneous wound was incised at the dorsal region of all the experimental animals. The ADSCs were labeled with CM-Dil fluorescent staining. Wound healing was assessed for all animal groups by observing the rate of wound closure and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-ß, and vascular endothelial growth factor at the wound sites was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to evaluate the effect of growth factors secreted by ADSCs. The differentiation of ADSCs was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining.RESULTS: The ADSC-seeded SF/CS film treatment significantly increased the rates of wound closure in treated animals, and hence wound healing was drastically enhanced for ADSC-SF/CS treatment groups compared with control groups and SF/CS film treatment group. Histological observations showed the condition of wound healing. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence staining observations showed the secretion and differentiation of ADSCs, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses clearly suggested that it is feasible and effective to enhance wound healing in a diabetic rat model with ADSC-seeded SF/CS film.</p>

<p>Many adipose tissue-related diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, are worldwide epidemics. For studying these diseases, relevant human cell models are needed. In this study, we developed a vascularized adipose tissue model where human adipose stromal cells and human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were cocultured with natural adipogenic and defined serum-free angiogenic media for 14 days. Several different protocols were compared to each other. The protocols varied in cell numbers and plating sequences. Lipid accumulation was studied with AdipoRed reagent, relative cell number with WST-1 reagent, gene expression of glut4, leptin, aP2, adiponectin, PPAR<U+03B3> and PPAR<U+03B3>2 with RT-qPCR. Secretion of adiponectin, leptin and aP2 was analysed with ELISA. The immunostained vascular network was imaged with Cell-IQ and area quantified using ImageJ. In this study, both angiogenesis and adipogenesis were successfully induced. Protocols produced strong lipid accumulation, good vascular network formation and induced adipocyte-specific protein secretion and expression of studied adipocyte genes. Results showed that cell numbers and cell plating sequences are important factors when aiming at in vitro standardized tissue model. Presence of mature vasculature appeared leads to faster the maturation of adipocytes judged by the lipid accumulation and gene expression results. The developed vascularized adipose tissue model is simple to use, easily modifiable to suit various applications and as such, a promising new tool for adipose tissue research when, for example, studying the effect of different cell types on adipose tissue function or for mechanistic studies.</p>

<p>The successful regeneration of large volume bone defects necessitates the use of proangiogenic and resorbable scaffolding matrix. Impaired and slow ingrowth of host vasculature within implanted grafts greatly compromises its effective osseointegration. By addressing this, it is demonstrated that the use of copper doped bioactive glass functionalizes silk microfiber reinforcements to improve the physicochemical and osteoinductive properties of two silk scaffolding matrices (mulberry Bombyx mori and non-mulberry Antheraea assama) employed in the study. The reinforced composite matrices increase the surface area and present an open porous biomimetic micromillieu favoring stem cell and endothelial cell migration within the matrix. Biochemical results indicate the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 in adipose derived human mesenchymal stem cells, which regulate the downstream proangiogenic signaling and endothelial cell homing, respectively. Osteoinduction, matrix turnover, and resorption effectiveness are favored better in the non-mulberry silk matrices. The composite matrices significantly promote neo-osseous tissue formation in volumetric femur defect in rabbits with periosteal restoration seen in the non-mulberry silk composite matrices. Evidences of total resorption, enhanced vascular-fibrous tissue ingrowth within the scaffold, vouch for the potential clinical translation of these developed composite silk matrices.</p>

<p>Metabolic disorders due to over-nutrition are a major global health problem, often associated with obesity and related morbidities. Obesity is peculiar to humans, as it is associated with lifestyle and diet, and so difficult to reproduce in animal models. Here we describe a model of human central adiposity based on a 3-tissue system consisting of a series of interconnected fluidic modules. Given the causal link between obesity and systemic inflammation, we focused primarily on pro-inflammatory markers, examining the similarities and differences between the 3-tissue model and evidence from human studies in the literature. When challenged with high levels of adiposity, the in-vitro system manifests cardiovascular stress through expression of E-selectin and von Willebrand factor as well as systemic inflammation (expressing IL-6 and MCP-1) as observed in humans. Interestingly, most of the responses are dependent on the synergic interaction between adiposity and the presence of multiple tissue types. The set-up has the potential to reduce animal experiments in obesity research and may help unravel specific cellular mechanisms which underlie tissue response to nutritional overload.</p>

<p>Obesity represents one of the most complex public health challenges and has recently reached epidemic proportions. Obesity is also considered to be primarily responsible for the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome, defined as the coexistence in the same individual of several risk factors for atherosclerosis, including dyslipidemia, hypertension and hyperglycemia, as well as for cancer. Additionally, the presence of three of the five risk factors (abdominal obesity, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, high fasting glucose and high blood pressure) characterizes metabolic syndrome, which has serious clinical consequences. The current study was conducted in order to identify metabolic differences in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) collected from obese (body mass index 43-48) human subjects who were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, obese individuals who were metabolically healthy and nonobese healthy controls. Extensive gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analyses were used to obtain the untargeted VAT metabolomic profiles of 481 metabolites belonging to all biochemical pathways. Our results indicated consistent increases in oxidative stress markers from the pathologically obese samples in addition to subtle markers of elevated glucose levels that may be consistent with metabolic syndrome. In the tissue derived from the pathologically obese subjects, there were significantly elevated levels of plasmalogens, which may be increased in response to oxidative changes in addition to changes in glycerolphosphorylcholine, glycerolphosphorylethanolamine glycerolphosphorylserine, ceramides and sphingolipids. These data could be potentially helpful for recognizing new pathways that underlie the metabolic-vascular complications of obesity and may lead to the development of innovative targeted therapies.</p>

<p>Autologous fat particle transplantation has been widely used by surgeons. The present study evaluated the effect of Notoginsenoside R1 (NR1) treatment on rat autologous fat graft, along with the quality and retention rates. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=60) received fat particle auto-transplantation from the left abdominal cavity into lateral dorsum. A total of 14 days after surgery, NR1 in different doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) was injected into rats, following which blood and fat graft samples were harvested at days 7, 14 and 28. Assessments were carried out by hematoxylin and eosin staining, western blotting, ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The survival rate of fat grafts was increased in three experimental groups, as detected by weight measurement. Histological scoring demonstrated that there were significant differences in tissue integrity between the 100 mg/kg/day group and the other 3 groups. hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, angiotensin and S100 levels in the 100 mg/kg/day NR1 group was increased compared with the other 2 treatment groups; however, all 3 treatment groups demonstrated increased expression of these proteins compared with the control group. Additionally, cluster of differentiation (CD)68 exhibited negative expression and CD31 showed weakly positive expression in all three experiments, as assessed by IHC. In conclusion, 100 mg/kg/day NR1 may potentially promote the retention rate and enhance the quality of autologous fat grafts via increasing vascularity in the recipient site. These results implicate NR1 as a therapeutic strategy for the improvement of outcome following fat graft surgery.</p>

<p>Placental growth factor (PlGF), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) sub-family, plays a major role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Previous study demonstrated that PlGF-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice had gestational loss. In addition, PlGF secretion was up-regulated in isolated T lymphocytes (T-cell) upon CD3/CD28 stimulation, suggesting that PlGF could be a regulator of T-cell differentiation and development. T-cells are well known to play a critical role in obesity-induced inflammation. Therefore, to verify the possible link of diet-induced obesity (DIO) with inflammation and related metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, we fed high-fat diet (HFD) to Tg mice for 16 weeks. Adiposity and glucose intolerance significantly increase in Tg mice fed a HFD (Tg HFD) compared to wild-type (WT) mice fed HFD (WT HFD). In addition, macrophage infiltrations were significantly higher in the epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), liver, and pancreatic islets of Tg HFD mice compared to WT HFD mice. In the in vitro study, we showed that isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells from Tg mice further differentiate into type 1 (Th1) and type 17 (Th17) helper T-cells via CD3/CD28 stimulation. Furthermore, we observed that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17, and TNFa, are remarkably increased in Tg mice compared to WT mice. These findings demonstrate that PlGF overexpression in T-cells might lead to inflammatory T-cell differentiation and accumulation in adipose tissue (AT) or metabolism-related tissues, contributing to the development of systemic metabolic disorders. Thus, PlGF may provide an effective therapeutic target in the management of obesity-induced inflammation and related metabolic disorders.</p>

Here, we aimed to further characterise microvascular tube formation in fibrin by determining the role of scaffold degradation, thrombin concentration and culture conditions on vascularisation.We observed that inhibition of cell-mediated fibrin degradation by the commonly used inhibitor aprotinin resulted in impaired vascular network formation. Aprotinin had no effect on laminin and collagen type IV deposition or formation of tube-like structures in scaffold-free co-culture, indicating that poor vascularisation of fibrin clots is primarily caused by inhibition of plasminogen-driven fibrinolysis. Co-culture in plasminogen- and factor XIII-depleted fibrin did not result in different vascular network density compared to controls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that thrombin negatively affects vascular network density at high concentrations. However, only transient activation of incorporated endothelial cells by thrombin could be observed, thus excluding a long-term inflammatory response in tissue-engineered micro-capillaries. Finally, we show that vascularisation of fibrin scaffolds in basal medium is undermined because of increased fibrinolytic activity leading to scaffold destabilisation without aprotinin.</AbstractText>: We observed that inhibition of cell-mediated fibrin degradation by the commonly used inhibitor aprotinin resulted in impaired vascular network formation.

<p>Upper body adipose tissue accumulation has been associated with clustering of metabolic disorders and increased cardiovascular risk. Neck circumference (NC) indicated that subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in that region is an independent pathogenic depot that might account for the additional risk missed by visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Neck adipose tissue (NAT) is not only one more ectopic depot but has several particular features that might modulate its metabolic role. Besides a controversial impact on obstructive apnea syndrome, neck fat encompasses carotid arteries as an important perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) depot. With dysfunctional changes in obesity, physiologic vascular regulation is lost and inflammatory signals accelerate atherogenesis. Unexpected was the discovery of brown and beige adipocytes in the neck of human adults. When stimulated, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy through thermogenesis and it is associated with other favorable metabolic effects. Moreover, the neck is the region where the browning mechanism was disclosed. With this unique plastic nature, NAT revealed multiple ties, challenging dynamics and potential new therapeutic targets that might have significant implications on metabolic outcomes and vascular risk.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To explore repairing results of VEGF165 gene modified adipose-derived stem cells for diabetic rats with bone defect.METHODS: Seventy-eight male Wistar rats weighted 180 to 220 g were selected, 72 rats were established diabetic animal models by streptozotocin inducement method, blood glucose level was more than 16.7 mmol/L. Experimental animals were randomly divided into 5 groups, 6 rats in normal group and each 18 rats in other groups. VEGF165 gene modified adipose-derived stem cells were implanted into normal group with bone defect; single diabetic rats with bone defect were named as diabetic group;vascular endothelial growth factor implanted into single diabetic rats with bone defect named as growth factor group; adipose-derived stem cells implanted into diabetic rats with bone defect names as stem cell group; VEGF165 gene modified adipose-derived stem cells implanted diabetic rats with bone defect named as experimental group. After combination of VEGF165-ADSCs (5×106) cells combined with gel sponge, implanted into diabetic rats with bone defect. On the forth week, general form of defect repairing tissue were observed by optical microscopy;local density of micro-vessel were detected by immunohistochemistry method; content of Ca, P and ALP of repairing callus were detected by IRIS Intrepid XSP inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer. Efficacy of the VEGF165-ADSCs repairing function was evaluated by SPSS statistic software.RESULTS: Fluorescent staining results showed that expression of VEGF165 located on cytoplasm of ADSCs, expression percentage was more than 87%; general histology results showed that callus formation and quality was near to normal group, repairing results in diabetes group, growth factor group and stem cell group were poor. On the Forth week after implantation, content of Ca, P and ALP of repairing callus in experimental group were higher than those in growth group and stem cell group, and without significant differences compared with normal group; blood vessel density in experimental group was lower than normal group, but higher than other groups.CONCLUSIONS: VEGF165 gene modified adipose-derived stem cells for repairing diabetic rats with bone defect has advantages of osteogenesis and angiogenesis, and should be one of the effective method for repairing diabetic rats with bone defect.</p>

<p>Cholesterol is not the only lipid that causes heart disease. Triglyceride supplies the heart and skeletal muscles with highly efficient fuel and allows for the storage of excess calories in adipose tissue. Failure to transport, acquire, and use triglyceride leads to energy deficiency and even death. However, overabundance of triglyceride can damage and impair tissues. Circulating lipoprotein-associated triglycerides are lipolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and hepatic triglyceride lipase. We inhibited these enzymes and showed that LpL inhibition reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by &gt;50%, and hepatic triglyceride lipase inhibition shifts low-density lipoprotein to larger, more buoyant particles. Genetic variations that reduce LpL activity correlate with increased cardiovascular risk. In contrast, macrophage LpL deficiency reduces macrophage function and atherosclerosis. Therefore, muscle and macrophage LpL have opposite effects on atherosclerosis. With models of atherosclerosis regression that we used to study diabetes mellitus, we are now examining whether triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or their hydrolysis by LpL affect the biology of established plaques. Following our focus on triglyceride metabolism led us to show that heart-specific LpL hydrolysis of triglyceride allows optimal supply of fatty acids to the heart. In contrast, cardiomyocyte LpL overexpression and excess lipid uptake cause lipotoxic heart failure. We are now studying whether interrupting pathways for lipid uptake might prevent or treat some forms of heart failure.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) represents an attractive source of adult stem cells and progenitors, holding great promise for numerous cell therapy approaches. In 2017, it was reported that 1524 patients received autologous SVF following the enzymatic digestion of liposuction fat. The treatment was safe and effective and patients showed significant clinical improvement. In a collaborative study, we analyzed SVF obtained from 58 patients having degenerative, inflammatory, autoimmune diseases, and advanced stage cancer.CONCLUSIONS: We found that a 2:1 ratio of ADSCs to HSC-progenitors seems to be the key for a successful cell therapy. These findings open the way to future rational design of new treatment regimens for individuals by adjusting the cell ratio before the treatment.</p>

<p>Angiogenesis is a complicated and sequential process that plays an important role in different physiological processes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are pluripotent stem cells, are widely used for the treatment of ischemic and traumatic diseases, and exosomes derived from these cells can also promote angiogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to uncover mechanisms to improve MSC exosome-mediated angiogenesis. For this study, we isolated human adipose-derived MSCs (hAD-MSCs) and assessed differentiation ability and markers. Cells were divided into hypoxia-treated MSCs (H-MSCs) and normoxia-treated MSCs (N-MSC), and exosomes were extracted by ultrafiltration. Exosomes (100<U+2009>µg/mL) from H-MSCs and N-MSCs were added to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exosome uptake and the ability of endothelial cells to form tubes were detected in real time. Protein samples were collected at different time points to detect the expression of inhibitors (Vash1) and enhancers (Angpt1 and Flk1) of angiogenesis; we also assessed their related signaling pathways. We found that exosomes from the hypoxia group were more easily taken up by HUVECs; furthermore, their angiogenesis stimulatory activity was also significantly enhanced compared to that with exosomes from the normoxia group. HUVECs exposed to exosomes from H-MSCs significantly upregulated angiogenesis-stimulating genes and deregulated angiogenesis-inhibitory genes. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway in HUVECs were significantly increased by hypoxia-exposed exosomes. Moreover, a PKA inhibitor was shown to significantly suppress angiogenesis. Finally, we concluded that hypoxia-exposed exosomes derived from hAD-MSCs can improve angiogenesis by activating the PKA signaling pathway and promoting the expression of VEGF. These results could be used to uncover safe and effective treatments for traumatic diseases.</p>

<p>The detection of grade II-III central obesity on a corpse in conjunction with the identification of two additional criteria (such as arterial hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance) provides, if combined with the autopsy data (including the visual reduction of muscular mass, the increased total amount of the adipose tissue, gynecomastia in men together with hypertrophied abdominal adipose tissue accumulation, decreased face and body pilosis), a basis for diagnostics of metabolic syndrome (MS). The objective parameters for this purpose are waist circumference measurements, corpse weight and height, the degree of visceral obesity, narrowing of the renal arteries as a result of their compression by the surrounding adipose tissue, and accumulation of epicardial fat confirmed by the results of the biochemical analysis. The signs of plasmorrhagia combined with fibrinoid degeneration of the vascular walls in the microcirculatory bed make it possible to suspect, with a high degree of probability, the development of hypertensive crisis that may result in a sudden death of the patients presenting with metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a multifactorial microvascular disease induced by hyperglycemia and subsequent metabolic abnormalities. The resulting cell stress causes a sequela of events that ultimately can lead to severe vision impairment and blindness. The early stages are characterized by activation of glia and loss of pericytes, endothelial cells (EC) and neuronal cells. The integrity of the retinal microvasculature becomes affected, and, as a possible late response, macular edema may develop as a common reason for vision loss in patients with non-proliferative DR. Moreover, the local ischemia can trigger vasoproliferation leading to vision-threating proliferative DR (PDR) in humans. Available treatment options include control of metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Timely intervention of advanced DR stages with laser photocoagulation, intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or glucocorticoid drugs can reduce vision loss. As the pathology involves cell loss of both the vascular and neuroglial compartments, cell replacement strategies by stem and progenitor cells have gained considerable interest in the past years. Compared to other disease entities, so far little is known about the efficacy and potential mode of action of cell therapy in treatment of DR. In preclinical models of DR different cell types have been applied ranging from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and endothelial progenitor cells to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). The latter cell population can combine various modes of action (MoA), thus they are among the most intensely tested cell types in cell therapy. The aim of this review is to discuss the rationale for using MSC as potential cell therapy to treat DR. Accordingly, we will revise identified MoA of MSCs and speculate how these may support the repair of the damaged retina.</p>

<p>Insulin resistance in muscle, adipocytes and liver is a gateway to a number of metabolic diseases. Here, we show a selective deficiency in mitochondrial coenzyme Q (CoQ) in insulin-resistant adipose and muscle tissue. This defect was observed in a range of in vitro insulin resistance models and adipose tissue from insulin-resistant humans and was concomitant with lower expression of mevalonate/CoQ biosynthesis pathway proteins in most models. Pharmacologic or genetic manipulations that decreased mitochondrial CoQ triggered mitochondrial oxidants and insulin resistance while CoQ supplementation in either insulin-resistant cell models or mice restored normal insulin sensitivity. Specifically, lowering of mitochondrial CoQ caused insulin resistance in adipocytes as a result of increased superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production via complex II. These data suggest that mitochondrial CoQ is a proximal driver of mitochondrial oxidants and insulin resistance, and that mechanisms that restore mitochondrial CoQ may be effective therapeutic targets for treating insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Purpose To evaluate the frequency and implications of perivascular fat stranding on coronary computed tomography (CT) angiograms obtained for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Materials and Methods This retrospective registry study was approved by the institutional review board. The authors reviewed the medical records and images of 1403 consecutive patients (796 men, 607 women; mean age, 52.8 years) who underwent coronary CT angiography at the emergency department from February 2012 to March 2016. Fat attenuation, length and number of circumferential quadrants of the affected segment, and attenuation values in the unaffected epicardial and subcutaneous fat were measured. “Cases” were defined as patients with perivascular fat stranding. Patients with significant stenosis but without fat stranding were considered control subjects. Baseline imaging characteristics, ACS frequency, and results of subsequent downstream testing were compared between cases and control subjects by using two-sample t, Mann-Whitney U, and Fisher tests. Results Perivascular fat stranding was seen in 11 subjects, nine with atherosclerotic lesions and two with spontaneous coronary artery dissections, with a mean fat stranding length of 19.2 mm and circumferential extent averaging 2.9 quadrants. The mean attenuation of perivascular fat stranding, normal epicardial fat, and normal subcutaneous fat was 17, -93.2, and -109.3 HU, respectively (P &lt; .001). Significant differences (P &lt; .05) between cases and control subjects included lower Agatston score, presence of wall motion abnormality, and initial elevation of serum troponin level. ACS frequency was 45.4% in cases and 3.8% in control subjects (P = .001). Conclusion Recognition of perivascular fat stranding may be a helpful additional predictor of culprit lesion and marker of risk for ACS in patients with significant stenosis or spontaneous coronary artery dissection. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue depots around the aorta are regionally distinct and have specific functional properties. Thoracic aorta perivascular adipose tissue (tPVAT) expresses higher levels of thermogenic genes and lower levels of inflammatory genes than abdominal aorta perivascular adipose tissue (aPVAT). It is not known whether this distinction is due to the in-vivo functional environment or to cell-autonomous traits that persist outside the in-vivo setting. In this study, we asked whether the progenitor cells in tPVAT and aPVAT have cell-autonomous traits that lead to formation of regionally distinct PVAT.</AbstractText>: Perivascular adipose tissue depots around the aorta are regionally distinct and have specific functional properties.

<p>It has been demonstrated that adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are a regenerative cell population with potential uses for bone and cartilage regeneration. However, the biomarker expression and heterogeneity of the population has not been thoroughly characterized. By analyzing biomarker expression, we aimed to understand the composition of ASC populations extracted using a common extraction technique in comparison to ASC populations given an additional purification step. Human adipose tissue samples were collected, and ASCs were extracted from these samples using a common, published extraction technique (primary extraction). These cells were cultured and half were given an additional purification. The primarily-extracted and purified cell populations were analyzed for biomarkers that correspond to specific cell types. The addition of the purification technique reduced the number of cells expressing hematopoietic and endothelial biomarkers and did not cause the yield of mesenchymal stem cell biomarker-expressing cells to decrease. Biomarkers corresponding to erythrocytes and lymphocytes were lost during the primary extraction, and biomarkers corresponding to most granulocytes and progenitor cells were lost during the additional purification. Biomarkers identifying dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and pericytes were upregulated in purified cell populations while those identifying fibroblasts and adipocytes were downregulated. Pluripotency biomarkers were more highly expressed in purified cell populations. These results demonstrate that the most commonly utilized adipose tissue recovery and ASC extraction technique leads to a heterogeneous cell population in which further purification of this population, as described in this manuscript, isolates a cell subset that has more regenerative potential.</p>

<p>The means by which epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) could influence coronary plaque progression biologically remain unclear. We investigated the association between the histological findings of EAT and coronary plaque characteristics assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). We enrolled 34 patients in whom one or more coronary plaques containing non-calcified components were detected on CCTA before cardiac surgery [coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or non-CABG]. We evaluated visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area, EAT volume, and coronary plaque characteristics including minimum computed tomography density (CTD) and vascular Remodeling Index (RI). Lower CTD and higher RI were considered as high-risk characteristics, and coronary plaque with both CTD &lt; 39 Hounsfield units and RI &gt; 1.05 was defined as two-characteristic plaque (2-CP). The numbers of CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages and CD31<sup>+</sup> microvessels were assessed in six random high-power fields (400×) of EAT samples obtained during cardiac surgery. The entire cohort showed a wide range of EAT volume, which were similar between patients with 2-CP and those without. Patients with 2-CP had more amounts of EAT macrophages (85 ± 38 versus 45 ± 22, p = 0.0005) and vascularity (62 ± 33 versus 37 ± 19, p = 0.013) than those without. On multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, coronary risk factors, statin use, type of surgery, VAT area, EAT volume, and coronary calcium score, the presence of 2-CP showed significant correlation with increased EAT macrophages (ß = 0.65, p = 0.014) and vascularity (ß = 0.74, p = 0.0053). Our findings support the hypothesis that EAT biologic activities are associated with coronary plaque vulnerability.</p>

<p>The advantages of adipose-derived stem cells (AdSCs) over bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), such as being available as a medical waste and less discomfort during harvest, have made them a good alternative instead of BMSCs in tissue engineering. AdSCs from buccal fat pad (BFP), as an easily harvestable and accessible source, have gained interest to be used for bone regeneration in the maxillofacial region. Due to scarcity of data regarding comparative analysis of isolated AdSCs from different parts of the body, we aimed to quantitatively compare the proliferation and osteogenic capabilities of AdSCs from different harvesting sites. In this study, AdSCs were isolated from BFP (BFPdSCs), abdomen (abdomen-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AbdSCs)), and hip (hip-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HdSCs)) from one individual and were compared for surface marker expression, morphology, growth rate, and osteogenic differentiation capability. Among them, BFPdSCs demonstrated the highest proliferation rate with the shortest doubling time and also expressed vascular endothelial markers including CD34 and CD146. Moreover, the expression of osteogenic markers were significantly higher in BFPdSCs. The results of this study suggested that BFPdSCs as an encouraging source of mesenchymal stem cells are to be used for bone tissue engineering.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue dysfunction is causally implicated in the impaired metabolic homeostasis associated with obesity; however, detailed mechanisms underlying dysregulated adipocyte functions in obesity remain to be elucidated. Here we searched for genes that provide a previously unknown mechanism in adipocyte metabolic functions and identified family with sequence similarity 13, member A (Fam13a) as a factor that modifies insulin signal cascade in adipocytes. Fam13a was highly expressed in adipose tissue, predominantly in mature adipocytes, and its expression was substantially reduced in adipose tissues of obese compared with lean mice. We revealed that Fam13a accentuated insulin signaling by recruiting protein phosphatase 2A with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), leading to protection of IRS1 from proteasomal degradation. We further demonstrated that genetic loss of Fam13a exacerbated obesity-related metabolic disorders, while targeted activation of Fam13a in adipocytes ameliorated it in association with altered adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in mice. Our data unveiled a previously unknown mechanism in the regulation of adipocyte insulin signaling by Fam13a and identified its significant role in systemic metabolic homeostasis, shedding light on Fam13a as a pharmacotherapeutic target to treat obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: The association of lower limb ischemia (LLI) with disturbances in nutritional status, in respect to over- or undernutrition, is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to present the current state of knowledge on this issue.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Systematic review of papers published between 2006 and 2018.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The literature shows inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of nutritional status on the risk, course, prognosis and outcomes of conservative and invasive treatment of LLI. The majority of publications available demonstrate greater LLI prevalence in overweight and obese patients, a worse prognosis both in malnourished and severely obese patients, poorer outcomes of invasive treatment in underweight patients, and better results for endovascular and surgical treatment in patients with overweight and class I obesity, although without such a relationship for conservative therapy. Possible explanations linking nutritional status and LLI seem to be: the endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine activity of adipose tissue, a decrease in physical activity, and the effect of diet-dependent comorbidities, e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing body of evidence concerning an association between LLI and patients’ nutritional status. A so-called “obesity paradox” or “BMI paradox” seems to exist among patients with LLI and mainly concerns outcomes of endovascular and surgical treatment. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of body composition, the distribution and endocrine activity of adipose tissue, and the effect of weight reduction and/or nutritional support in the LLI patient group.</p>

<p>Non-contrast cardiac computed tomography in order to obtain the coronary artery calcium score has become an established diagnostic procedure in the clinical setting, and is commonly employed in clinical and population-based research. This state-of-the-art review paper highlights the potential gain in information that can be obtained from the non-contrast coronary calcium scans without any necessary modifications to the scan protocol. This includes markers of cardio-metabolic health, such as the amount of epicardial fat and liver fat, but also markers of general health including bone density and lung density. Finally, this paper addresses the importance of incidental findings and of radiation exposure accompanying imaging with non-contrast cardiac computed tomography. Despite the fact that coronary calcium scan protocols have been optimized for the visualization of coronary calcification in terms image quality and radiation exposure, it is important for radiologists, cardiologists and medical specialists in the field of preventive medicine to acknowledge that numerous additional markers of cardio-metabolic health and general health can be readily identified on a coronary calcium scan.KEY POINTS: • The coronary artery calcium score substantially increased the use of cardiac CT. • Cardio-metabolic and general health markers may be derived without changes to the scan protocol. • Those include epicardial fat, aortic valve calcifications, liver fat, bone density, and lung density. • Clinicians must be aware of this potential additional yield from non-contrast cardiac CT.</p>

<p>We constructed a UC-VEGF-SMC three dimensional (3D) scaffold to explore its effect on blood vessel regeneration and bladder repair function in a rabbit model with bladder injury. Rabbit adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were cultured to construct pluripotent stem cell systems that can be induced to differentiate into urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, MTT assay and HE staining were used in our study. Rabbit models were divided into an experimental group, control group and sham group. The bladder histology, urodynamics, smooth muscle function, stent degradation rate, urothelial permeability and biomechanical determination of rabbits were detected after grafting the scaffold. Correct stem cells based on the ADSC surface marker and found that CD90 and CD105 were positive and that CD34 and CD45 were negative. RT-PCR showed that ADSC-iPS cells expressed the marker gene of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which indicated that Sox2, Klf4, Oct4 and c-Myc were inserted into the iPS nucleus and that the ADSC-iPS system was constructed successfully. Immunofluorescence and MTT assays indicated that iPS differentiated into mature SMCs and UCs. ELISA and HEMC culturing methods revealed that vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF) could promote the growth of HMECs. Rabbit bladder repair function (urodynamics, smooth muscle function, urothelial permeability and biomechanical determination) was stronger in the experimental group than in the control group. UC-VEGF-SMC 3D nano scaffold exhibits good repair function for bladder damage, which may helpful for treatment of damaged bladders.</p>

<p>Chronic changes following radiotherapy include alterations in tissue-resident stem cells and vasculatures, which can lead to impaired wound healing. In this study, novel recombinant human collagen peptide (rhCP) scaffolds were evaluated as a biomaterial carrier for cellular regenerative therapy. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were successfully cultured on rhCP scaffolds. By hASC culture on rhCP, microarray assay indicated that expression of genes related to cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production was upregulated. Pathway analyses revealed that signaling pathways related to inflammatory suppression and cell growth promotion were activated as well as signaling pathways consistent with some growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta, although gene expression of these growth factors was not upregulated. These findings suggest the rhCP scaffold showed similar biological actions to cytokines regulating cell growth and immunity. In subsequent impaired wound healing experiments using a locally irradiated (20 Gray) mouse, wound treatment with rhCP sponges combined with cultured hASCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells accelerated wound closure compared with wounds treated with rhCP with hASCs alone, rhCP only, and control (dressing alone), with better healing observed according to this order. These results indicating the therapeutic value of rhCP scaffolds as a topical biomaterial dressing and a biocarrier of stem cells and vascular endothelial cells for regenerating therapies. The combination of rhCP and functional cells was suggested to be a potential tool for revitalizing stem cell-depleted conditions such as radiation tissue damage.</p>

<p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common maligmancies and causes of death among men. Radical prostatectomy (RP) is optimal and recommended treatment modality for localized prostate cancer. More than half of all men undergoing surgery experience problems with erectile function and existing treatments do not provide a positive effect. Thus, there is a need for new approaches to the restoration of erectile function in patients after RP. One of these is the use of cell technologies, namely the stromal-vascular fraction and autologous platelet-rich plasma. This review examines the results of preclinical and clinical studies investigating the efficacy and safety of these treatment options in erectile dysfunction.</p>

<p>We analyzed the effects of 1 year of engagement in =<U+2009>300 min/week of organized sports on inflammatory levels and vascular structure in adolescents. The sample was composed of 89 adolescents (11.6<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.7 years old [43 boys and 46 girls]), stratified according to engagement in =<U+2009>300 min/week of sport practice during at least 12 months of follow-up (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>15, sport practice; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>74, non-sport practice). Arterial thickness (carotid and femoral) was assessed by ultrasound scan, while high sensitive C-reactive protein levels were used to assess inflammatory status. Trunk fatness (densitometry scanner), biological maturation (age at peak height velocity), blood pressure, and skipping breakfast were treated as covariates. Independently of body fatness and biological maturation, the group engaged in sports presented a higher reduction in C-reactive protein (mean difference -1.559 mg/L [95%CI -2.539 to -0.579]) than the non-sport group (mean difference -0.414 mg/L [95%CI -0.846 to 0.017]) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.040). There was a significant relationship between changes in C-reactive protein and changes in femoral intima-media thickness in the non-sport group (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.311 [95%CI 0.026 to 0.549]).CONCLUSION: Inflammation decreased in adolescents engaged in organized sports, independently of trunk fatness and biological maturation. Moreover, inflammation was related to arterial thickening only in adolescents not engaged in sports. What is Known: • Intima media thickness is a relevant marker of cardiovascular disease in pediatric groups, being affected by obesity and inflammation. • The importance of monitoring inflammatory markers from childhood is enhanced by the fact that alterations in these inflammatory markers in early life predict inflammation and alterations in carotid IMT in adulthood. What is New: • Anti-inflammatory properties related to physical exercise performed at moderate intensity, on inflammation and alterations in IMT are not clear in pediatric groups. • Due to the importance that sport participation has assumed as a promoter of improvements in health and quality of life, it is necessary to understand its potential benefits for cardiovascular health during human growth.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: Obesity predisposes to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The amino acid, L-taurine (Tau), regulates glucose and lipid homeostasis and vascular function. Here we investigated whether Tau supplementation prevents endothelial dysfunction in the thoracic aortas of monosodium glutamate-induced obese (MSG) rats.METHODS: Male rats received subcutaneous injections of MSG (4 mg/kg body weight/day) or saline (control group, CTL) during the first five days of life. From 21 to 150 days of age, the rats were distributed into the groups: CTL, MSG, and CTL and MSG supplemented with 2.5% Tau in their drinking water (CTAU and MTAU).RESULTS: At 150-days old, MSG rats presented massive abdominal fat deposition, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and high plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation marker. Tau supplementation attenuated fat accumulation in perigonadal adipose tissue and prevented the increase in triglycerides and MDA plasma levels. Aortic rings of MSG rats presented reduced vasodilation in response to acetylcholine (ACh). No modifications in insulin-induced vasodilatation, or Akt and eNOS phosphorylation, were observed in MSG aortas; thoracic aortas from MSG rats presented reduced tunica media thickness, with a lower aortic wall thickness/lumen diameter ratio and decreased total collagen content. Tau supplementation restored ACh-induced vasodilation and collagen content.CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents the first evidence that Tau prevents disruptions in vascular reactivity and in extracellular matrix composition in thoracic aortas of MSG-obese rats. The vascular protective actions of Tau may be linked to reduced lipid peroxidation and a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, such as abdominal fat and hypertriglyceridemia.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood pressure variation.METHODS: Using unique brown adipocyte-specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood pressure in mice.RESULTS: We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte-selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor-dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and blood pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of blood pressure.</p>

<p>Obesity is a key factor in metabolic syndrome. The study of metabolic syndrome focuses on the anti-weight gain properties of physiological mechanisms and food components. Abnormal energy metabolism is a major risk factor of metabolic syndrome. Chronic inflammation is a feature of obesity; cytokines from hypertrophied adipocytes cause inflammation in both adipose tissue and blood vessels, resulting in symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Tumor necrosis factor-a causes insulin resistance in adipocytes and regression of brown adipocytes, resulting in abnormal energy metabolism. Functional foods can serve as a strategy for prevention and treatment of obesity linked with metabolic processes in white and brown adipose tissues. Diet-induced thermogenesis caused by certain food components stimulates burning of stored fat within adipose tissues. A mechanistic understanding of dietary thermogenesis via the sympathetic nerve system will prove valuable for the development of precise strategies for the practical prevention of metabolic syndrome.</p>

Although liposuction is a simple procedure for the harvest of adipose tissue, the repetition of this surgical intervention can cause adverse effects to the patient and can be a limiting factor for immediate use. Cryopreservation can avoid the morbidity associated with repetitive liposuction, allowing the use of stored tissue after the initial harvest procedure.

<p>INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to explore the effect of microdissected thin anterolateral thigh (MTALT) perforator flap with multiple perforators on patients with complex defects on the hand, elbow, heel, or knee.METHODS: From March 2012 to February 2013, 5 patients with complex defects on the hand, elbow, heel, or knee were included. During the flap preparation, 2 to 3 perforators penetrating the fascia of the anterolateral femoral area were initially detected, and the deep fascia was incised. The superficial fascia layer of the flap and the deep adipose were then dissected, and removed after verifying the distribution of the blood vessels using an operating microscope. The whole flap was then elevated, and transposed to the recipient areas for microsurgical reparation.RESULTS: Two cases of post-burn scar contracture and 3 cases of traumatic tissue defects were successfully reconstructed with these multiple-perforator MTALT flaps. No complication was reported, and secondary operative procedure was not needed in any patient in the follow-up.CONCLUSION: MTALT perforator flap with multiple perforators is safe and reliable for patients with complex defects on the hand, elbow, heel, or knee.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is a membrane-bound amine oxidase highly expressed in mature adipocytes and released into the circulation. VAP-1 has been strongly implicated in several pathological processes, including diabetes, inflammation, hypertension, hepatic steatosis and renal diseases, and is an important disease marker and therapeutic target. Here, we aimed to identify the genetic loci for circulating VAP-1 levels.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a genomic-wide linkage scan for the quantitative trait locus of circulating VAP-1 levels in 1,100 Han Chinese individuals from 398 families in the Stanford Asian Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance study. Regional association fine mapping was carried out using additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms.CONCLUSION: MACROD2 is a potential genetic determinant of serum VAP-1 levels, probably through transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor in the liver, which is composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and adipose cells. The proportion of each component varies, making a diagnosis difficult. This paper reports a case of AML in the liver without adipose tissue, mimicking a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which was diagnosed by a surgical tissue biopsy. A 65-year-old woman was admitted for an evaluation of a hepatic mass that had been detected by ultrasonography. The serologic markers of viral hepatitis B and C were negative. The liver function tests and alpha fetoprotein level were within the normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1.9 cm sized mass in segment 6 of the liver with early arterial enhancement and washout on the delayed phase accompanied by a rim-like enhancement, which is similar to the imaging findings of HCC. A frozen section examination during surgery indicated a hepatocellular neoplasm and suggested the possibility of HCC. On the other hand, the final pathologic diagnosis was epithelioid myoid type of AML with no adipose tissue component. The tumor cells were positive for human melanocyte B-45 and negative for cytokeratin and hepatocyte paraffin 1. This paper reports a very rare case of AML without adipose tissue in the liver mimicking HCC that was diagnosed by a surgical tissue biopsy.</p>

<p>Macrophages in adipose tissue contribute to inflammation and the development of insulin resistance in obesity. Exposure of macrophages to saturated fatty acids alters cell metabolism and activates pro-inflammatory signaling. How fatty acids influence macrophage mitochondrial dynamics is unclear. We investigated the mechanism of palmitate-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and its impact on inflammatory responses in primary human macrophages. Fatty acids, such as palmitate, caused mitochondrial fragmentation in human macrophages. Increased mitochondrial fragmentation was also observed in peritoneal macrophages from hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Fatty acid-induced mitochondrial fragmentation was independent of the fatty acid chain saturation and required dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Mechanistically, mitochondrial fragmentation was regulated by incorporation of palmitate into mitochondrial phospholipids and their precursors. Palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential did not contribute to mitochondrial fragmentation. Macrophages treated with palmitate maintained intact mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of DRP1 enhanced palmitate-induced mitochondrial ROS production, c-Jun phosphorylation, and inflammatory cytokine expression. Our results indicate that mitochondrial fragmentation is a protective mechanism attenuating inflammatory responses induced by palmitate in human macrophages.</p>

<p>Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of serious heart failure events in patients with type 2 diabetes, but little is known about mechanisms that might mediate this benefit. The most common heart failure phenotype in type 2 diabetes is obesity-related heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). It has been hypothesized that the synthesis of leptin in this disorder leads to sodium retention and plasma volume expansion as well as to cardiac and renal inflammation and fibrosis. Interestingly, leptin-mediated neurohormonal activation appears to enhance the expression of SGLT2 in the renal tubules, and SGLT2 inhibitors exert natriuretic actions at multiple renal tubular sites in a manner that can oppose the sodium retention produced by leptin. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the accumulation and inflammation of perivisceral adipose tissue, thus minimizing the secretion of leptin and its paracrine actions on the heart and kidneys to promote fibrosis. Such fibrosis probably contributes to the impairment of cardiac distensibility and glomerular function that characterizes obesity-related HFpEF. Ongoing clinical trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure are positioned to confirm or refute the hypothesis that these drugs may favourably influence the course of obesity-related HFpEF by their ability to attenuate the secretion and actions of leptin.</p>

<p>Solid tumor growth and metastasis require the interaction of tumor cells with the surrounding tissue, leading to a view of tumors as tissue-level phenomena rather than exclusively cell-intrinsic anomalies. Due to the ubiquitous nature of adipose tissue, many types of solid tumors grow in proximate or direct contact with adipocytes and adipose-associated stromal and vascular components, such as fibroblasts and other connective tissue cells, stem and progenitor cells, endothelial cells, innate and adaptive immune cells, and extracellular signaling and matrix components. Excess adiposity in obesity both increases risk of cancer development and negatively influences prognosis in several cancer types, in part due to interaction with adipose tissue cell populations. Herein, we review the cellular and noncellular constituents of the adipose “organ,” and discuss the mechanisms by which these varied microenvironmental components contribute to tumor development, with special emphasis on obesity. Due to the prevalence of breast and prostate cancers in the United States, their close anatomical proximity to adipose tissue depots, and their complex epidemiologic associations with obesity, we particularly highlight research addressing the contribution of adipose tissue to the initiation and progression of these cancer types. Obesity dramatically modifies the adipose tissue microenvironment in numerous ways, including induction of fibrosis and angiogenesis, increased stem cell abundance, and expansion of proinflammatory immune cells. As many of these changes also resemble shifts observed within the tumor microenvironment, proximity to adipose tissue may present a hospitable environment to developing tumors, providing a critical link between adiposity and tumorigenesis. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is cushion of fat tissue surrounding blood vessels, which is phenotypically different from other adipose tissue depots. PVAT is composed of adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction, constituted by different populations of immune cells, endothelial cells, and adipose-derived stromal cells. It expresses and releases an important number of vasoactive factors with paracrine effects on vascular structure and function. In healthy individuals, these factors elicit a net anticontractile and anti-inflammatory paracrine effect aimed at meeting hemodynamic and metabolic demands of specific organs and regions of the body. Pathophysiological situations, such as obesity, diabetes or hypertension, induce changes in its amount and in the expression pattern of vasoactive factors leading to a PVAT dysfunction in which the beneficial paracrine influence of PVAT is shifted to a pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, contractile, and trophic environment leading to functional and structural cardiovascular alterations and cardiovascular disease. Many different PVATs surrounding a variety of blood vessels have been described and exhibit regional differences. Both protective and deleterious influence of PVAT differs regionally depending on the specific vascular bed contributing to variations in the susceptibility of arteries and veins to vascular disease. PVAT therefore, might represent a novel target for pharmacological intervention in cardiovascular disease. © 2018 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 8:23-59, 2018.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high fructose intake associated with moderate increase in adiposity on rat arterial adrenergic responses and their modulation by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). After eight-week-lasting substitution of drinking water with 10 % fructose solution in adult normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), their systolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, and relative liver weight were elevated when compared to their respective control groups. Moreover, in SHR, body weight and relative heart weight were increased after treatment with fructose. In superior mesenteric arteries, PVAT exerted inhibitory influence on adrenergic contractile responses and this effect was markedly stronger in control WKY than in SHR. In fructose-administered WKY, arterial adrenergic contractions were substantially reduced in comparison with the control group; this was caused mainly by enhancement of anticontractile action of PVAT. The diminution of the mesenteric arterial contractions was not observed after fructose treatment in SHR. We conclude that the increase in body adiposity due to fructose overfeeding in rats might have prehypertensive effect. However, in WKY it might cause PVAT-dependent and independent reduction in arterial contractile responses to adrenergic stimuli, which could attenuate the pathological elevation in vascular tone.</p>

What is the main finding and its importance? Release of TNFa by tPVAT causes production of reactive oxygen species in tPVAT through activation of an NADPH-oxidase 2 (NOX2)-dependent pathway, activates production of aortic reactive oxygen species and mediates aortic stiffness, potentially through matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity.

Thoracic aorta and tPVAT were removed from 16- to 17-week-old lean (LZR, n = 16) and obese Zucker rats (OZR, n = 16). The OZR presented with aortic endothelial dysfunction, assessed by wire myography, and increased aortic stiffness, assessed by elastic modulus. The OZR tPVAT exudate further exacerbated the endothelial dysfunction, reducing nitric oxide and endothelium-dependent relaxation (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, OZR tPVAT exudate had increased MMP9 activity (P &lt; 0.05) and further increased the elastic modulus of the aorta after 72 h of co-culture (P &lt; 0.05). We found that the observed aortic dysfunction caused by OZR tPVAT was mediated through increased production and release of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa; P &lt; 0.01), which was dependent on tPVAT NADPH-oxidase 2 (NOX2) activity. The OZR tPVAT release of reactive oxygen species and subsequent aortic dysfunction were inhibited by TNFa neutralization and/or inhibition of NOX2.

<p>The potential effects of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) on the growth and invasion of canine tumours including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not yet understood. Moreover in humans, the functional contribution of AT-MSCs to malignancies remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of AT-MSCs on the proliferation and invasion of canine HCC cells in vitro. The effect of AT-MSCs on mRNA levels of factors related to HCC progression were also evaluated. Conditioned medium from AT-MSCs (AT-MSC-CM) significantly enhanced canine HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1, epidermal growth factor A, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor 2 were 2.3 ± 0.4, 2.0 ± 0.5, 5.7 ± 1.9, 1.7 ± 0.2, 2.1 ± 0.4, and 1.4 ± 0.3 times higher, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The mRNA expression level of MMP-2 also increased (to 4.0 ± 1.2 times control levels) in canine HCC cells co-cultured with AT-MSCs, but MMP-9 mRNA significantly decreased (to 0.5 ± 0.1 times control levels). These findings suggest that soluble factors from AT-MSCs promote the proliferation and invasion of canine HCC cells.</p>

<p>The isolation of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from excised human adipose tissue, for clinical or research purposes, implies the tedious and time consuming process of manual mincing prior to enzymatic digestion. Since no efficient alternative technique to this current standard procedure has been proposed so far, the aim of this study was to test a milling procedure, using two simple, inexpensive and commercially available manual meat grinders, to process large amounts of adipose tissue. The procedure was assessed on adipose tissue resections from seven human donors and compared to manual mincing with scalpels. The processed adipose tissues were digested and the resulting SVF cells compared in terms of number, clonogenicity and differentiation capacity. After 10 min of processing, either device tested yielded on average sixfold more processed material for subsequent cell isolation than manual mincing. The isolation yield of SVF cells (isolated cells per ml of adipose tissue), their viability, phenotype, clonogenicity and osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation capacity, tested by production of mineralized matrix and lipid vacuoles, respectively, were comparable. This new method is practical and inexpensive and represents an efficient alternative to the current standard for large scale adipose tissue resection processing. A device based on the milling principle could be embedded within a streamlined system for isolation and clinical use of SVF cells from adipose tissue excision.</p>

We anticipate that dietary interventions are worthwhile strategies in advanced T2D, and that reduction in AEA may contribute to the improved cardiometabolic phenotype induced by weight loss.</AbstractText>: Caloric restriction in T2D patients with CAD decreases AEA levels, but not 2-AG levels, which is paralleled by decreased lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, liver and heart, and improved cardiovascular function.

<p>Inflammation in adipose tissues in obesity promotes insulin resistance and metabolic disease. The Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) is a promiscuous non-signaling receptor expressed on erythrocytes and other cell types that modulates tissue inflammation by binding chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and by acting as a chemokine reservoir. DARC allelic variants are common in humans, but the role of DARC in modulating obesity-related metabolic disease is unknown.</AbstractText>: Inflammation in adipose tissues in obesity promotes insulin resistance and metabolic disease.

Insulin production was not reduced by DARC gene deletion, and plasma leptin levels were similar in HFD fed wild-type and DARC knockout mice. MCP-1 levels in plasma rose significantly in the HFD fed wild-type mice, but not in the DARC knockout mice. Conversely, adipose tissue MCP-1 levels were higher, and more macrophage crown-like structures were detected, in the HFD fed DARC knockout mice as compared with the wild-type mice, consistent with augmented adipose tissue inflammation that is not accurately reflected by plasma levels of DARC-bound MCP-1 in these mice.</AbstractText>: Compared to wild-type mice, HFD-fed DARC knockout mice developed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance independent of increases in body weight or adiposity.

<p>BACKGROUND: Large-scale muscle tissue engineering remains a major challenge. An axial vascular pedicle and perfusion bioreactor are necessary for the development and maintenance of large-scale engineered muscle to ensure circulation within the construct. We aimed to develop a novel experimental model of a large-scale engineered muscle flap from an existing rat groin fat flap.METHODS: A fat flap based on the superficial inferior epigastric vascular pedicle was excised from rats and placed into a perfusion bioreactor. The flaps were kept in the bioreactor for up to 7 weeks, and transdifferentiation of adipose to muscle tissue could have taken place. This system enabled myogenic-differentiation medium flow through the bioreactor at constant pH and oxygen concentration. Assessment of viability was performed by an immunofluorescence assay, histological staining, a calcein-based live/dead test, and through determination of RNA quantity and quality after 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks.RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining showed that smooth muscle around vessels was still intact without signs of necrosis or atrophy. The visual assessment of viability by the calcein-based live/dead test revealed viability of the rat adipose tissue preserved in the bioreactor system with permanent perfusion. RNA samples from different experimental conditions were quantified by spectrophotometry, and intact bands of 18S and 28S rRNA were detected by gel electrophoresis, indicating that degradation of RNA was minimal.CONCLUSIONS: Flow perfusion maintains the long-term viability of a rat groin engineered muscle flap in vitro, and a large-scale vascularized muscle could be engineered in a perfusion bioreactor.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue plays a role in the storage of excess energy as triglycerides (TGs). Excess fat accumulation causes various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. It has been reported that ectopic fat deposition and excess TG accumulation in non-adipose tissue might be important predictors of cardiometabolic and vascular risk. For example, ectopic fat in perivascular tissue promotes atherosclerotic plaque formation in the arterial wall.OBJECTIVE: Recently, it has been reported that ectopic fat (adipocyte) in the vascular wall of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is present in both human and experimental animal models. The pathological significance of adipocytes in the AAA wall has not been fully understood. In this review, we summarized the functions of adipocytes and discussed potential new drugs that target vascular adipocytes for AAA treatment.RESULT: Previous studies suggest that adipocytes in vascular wall play an important role in the development of AAA.CONCLUSION: Adipocytes in the vascular wall could be novel targets for the development of AAA therapeutic drugs.</p>

<p>Prevailing knowledge links chronic low-grade inflammation in the adipose tissue to obesity and its associated metabolic complications. In this study, we evaluated immunometabolic effects of a recently launched dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a &amp; <U+03B3> agonist ‘Saroglitazar’ in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Body composition analysis revealed that saroglitazar treatment promoted hepatic weight gain, while attenuated epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) mass in DIO. In the eWAT of saroglitazar treated mice, histological analysis showed reduced adipocyte hypertrophy and matrix deposition (picrosirius red staining). Immunological profiling of stromal vascular fraction isolated from eWAT showed decreased pro-inflammatory cells (M1 macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T-cells) and increased anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Gene expression and western blot analysis suggested that saroglitazar promoted energy expenditure machinery and attenuated inflammatory as well as fibrotic markers in eWAT during DIO. In conclusion, for the first time we are reporting immunometabolic effects of dual PPARa &amp; <U+03B3> agonist saroglitazar in DIO and insulin resistance (IR). Saroglitazar exerted its beneficial effects on adipose tissue by limiting, diet-induced adipose tissue dysfunction, adipocyte hypertrophy, adipocyte cell damage and extracellular matrix deposition in obesity.</p>

<p>Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as CD26 is a type II transmembrane protein that is released from the cell membrane in a nonclassical secretory mechanism. This exopeptidase selectively degrades varieties of substrates including incretin hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. A significant detectable amount of DPP4 activity can be measured in plasma as well as in different tissues such as intestinal epithelium, vascular endothelium, lymphocytes, monocytes, kidney, liver, adipose, lung, thymus, spleen, prostate, etc. Enzymatically active circulatory DPP4 is shed from the plasma membrane via proteolytic cleavage, a process responsible for the enhanced plasma DPP4 levels and activity. Elevated circulatory DPP4 activity as well as levels has been found in wide spectrum of metabolic diseases including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Moreover, recent preclinical studies have further expanded the repertoire for the usage of DPP4 inhibitors in the treatment of other metabolic diseases and in their consequent complications. In the present review we highlight the reason behind the elevated circulatory DPP4 levels in metabolic diseases with a focus on the tissue of origin. We also underscore the discrepancy of protein levels with enzyme activity of circulatory DPP4 in metabolic diseases. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(2):112-119, 2018.</p>

<p>Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is an uncommon renal tumour, generally composed of mature adipose tissue, dysmorphic blood vessels and smooth muscle. Identification of intratumoral fat on unenhanced CT images is the most reliable finding for establishing the diagnosis of renal AML. However, AMLs sometimes exhibit atypical findings, including cystic as well as solid forms; some of these variants overlap with the appearance of other renal tumours. A rare type of AML, the epithelioid type, possesses malignant potential. The aim of this pictorial review is to gather the different imaging features of AMLs including the classic and fat-poor types, AMLs with epithelial cysts, epithelioid AML, AML associated with tuberous sclerosis, haemorrhagic AML and large AMLs mimicking retroperitoneal liposarcomas. The diagnostic clues that help to distinguish AMLs from other renal tumours are also described in the review.</p>

<p>The spleen is thought to play a role in atherosclerosis-associated immunity and cardiovascular research has indicated the existence of a cardio-splenic axis. The aim of this study was to assess splenic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake as a measure of systemic inflammation in patients with untreated psoriasis compared with historical controls assessed by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12, age 61.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.1 years, 83% men, mean<U+2009> Psoriasis Area Severity Index score of 14.5) and controls (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>23, age 60.4<U+2009>±<U+2009>4.5 years, 87% men) were included in the study. Splenic inflammation was measured using the background-corrected spleen-liver-ratio (SLR) based on mean standardized uptake values. Mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>SD SLR was increased in patients with psoriasis compared with controls (0.94<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11 vs. 0.82<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). SLR was significantly associated with aortic inflammation. These results support the existence of systemic inflammation in patients with psoriasis, and provide the rationale for a mechanistic link between psoriasis-driven inflammation and cardiovascular comorbidity through a spleen-atherosclerotic axis.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology, with heterogeneous clinical manifestations and chronic and often progressive course. The diffuse cutaneous form of SSc (dcSSc) is characterized by thickening of the skin (scleroderma) and distinctive involvement of multiple internal organs. Patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) generally have long-standing Raynaud’s phenomenon before other manifestations of SSc appear. Over the last decade the Interest of adipose-derived cell therapy in regenerative medicine has increased continuously. In compare to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are considered to be ideal for application in regenerative medicine. Zuk et al., introduced a multipotent, undifferentiated, self-renewing progenitor cell population isolated from adipose tissue, called processed lipoaspirate (PLA). However, subcutaneous injections of autologous adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF), which is known to contain mesenchymal stem cells, in hands of Patients with scleroderma for enhancing their impaired hand function is still in an experimental stage, although there are already promising results of the therapy. Commonly available therapeutic options for hands of Patients with systemic sclerosis, vasodilatator drugs and physiotherapy, have many restriction and limited effects.MATERIALS AND METHOD: A 62 years old woman with scleroderma presented with progressive digital necrosis, ulceration, gangrene and impaired wound healing, despite of conventional therapy with vasodilatator drugs. Water-jet-Assisted Liposuction (Body-jet® evo, human med AG, Schwerin, Germany) of subcutaneous abdominal fat was carried out under general anesthesia by an experienced surgeon. Autologous adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF) was harvested by in a single-use Q-graft® collector (human med AG, Schwerin, Germany). Cells were centrifuged in 400G for 5 minutes and cell pellets were aspirated carefully in a 20mL syringe filled with 0.9% NaCl. A total of ca. 2.72 million cells have been isolated. Meanwhile middle phalangeal amputation of digit 2, 3 and 4 of the left hand were performed, without closing the skin of the amputation stumps. The SVF cell suspension was injected subcutaneous into the area of metacarpophalangeal joints in both hands, as well as into the amputation stump of the left middle finger, and under a skin necrosis in the right hand.RESULTS: The therapy was good tolerated by the patient, with absence of adverse reactions. No infection was observed, despite open amputation. Three weeks after the stem cell therapy, no need to further amputation was demonstrated. The patient is still under regular clinical observation, in order to determine the long term effects of the therapy.CONCLUSION: Application of isolated adipose tissue-derived stem cells seems to be a very promising procedure in the treatment of the manifestation of systemic sclerosis. However, more clinical and experimental studies are required, in order to understand the exact mechanisms of action and standardize the therapy.</p>

<p>A promising strategy for treating peripheral ischemia involves the delivery of stem cells to promote angiogenesis through paracrine signaling. Treatment success depends on cell localization, retention, and survival within the mechanically dynamic intramuscular (IM) environment. Herein we describe an injectable, in situ-gelling hydrogel for the IM delivery of adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs), specifically designed to withstand the dynamic loading conditions of the lower limb and facilitate cytokine release from encapsulated cells. Copolymers of poly(trimethylene carbonate)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(trimethylene carbonate) diacrylate were used to modulate the properties of methacrylated glycol chitosan hydrogels crosslinked by thermally-initiated polymerization using ammonium persulfate and N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine. The scaffolds had an ultimate compressive strain over 75% and maintained mechanical properties during compressive fatigue testing at physiological levels. Rapid crosslinking (&lt;3<U+202F>min) was achieved at low initiator concentration (5<U+202F>mM). Following injection and crosslinking within the scaffolds, human ASCs demonstrated high viability (&gt;90%) over two weeks in culture under both normoxia and hypoxia. Release of angiogenic and chemotactic cytokines was enhanced from encapsulated cells under sustained hypoxia, in comparison to normoxic and tissue culture polystyrene controls. When delivered by IM injection in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, human ASCs were well retained in the scaffold over 28 days and significantly increased the IM vascular density compared to untreated controls.</p>

<p>Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 11 loci associated with adipose-related traits across different populations. However, their functional roles still remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the splicing regulation of these GWAS signals in a tissue-specific fashion. For adipose-related GWAS signals, we selected six adipose-related tissues (adipose subcutaneous, artery tibial, blood, heart left ventricle, muscle-skeletal, and thyroid) with the sample size greater than 80 for splicing quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using GTEx released datasets. We integrated GWAS summary statistics of nine adipose-related traits (an average of 2.6 million SNPs per GWAS), and splicing QTLs from 6 GTEx tissues with an average of 337,900 splicing QTL SNPs, and 684,859 junctions. Our filtering process generated an average of 86,549 SNPs and 162,841 exon-exon links (junctions) for each tissue. A total of seven exon-exon junctions in four genes (AKTIP, DTNBP1, FTO and UBE2E1) were found to be significantly associated with four SNPs that showed genome-wide significance with body fat distribution (rs17817288, rs7206790, rs11710420 and rs2237199). These splicing events might contribute to the causal effect on the regulation of ectopic-fat, which warrants further experimental validation.</p>
