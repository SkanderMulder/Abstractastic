<p>Gasotransmitters fulfill important roles in cellular homeostasis having been linked to various pathologies, including inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the known pathways mediating the actions of gasotransmitters, their effects in regulating mitochondrial function are emerging. Given that mitochondria are key organelles in energy production, formation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, they are important mediators in preserving health and disease. Preserving or restoring mitochondrial function by gasotransmitters may be beneficial, and mitigate pathogenetic processes. In this review we discuss the actions of gasotransmitters with focus on their role in mitochondrial function and their therapeutic potential.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.</p>

<h4>Converse role of class I and class IIa HDACs in the progression of atrial fibrillation.</h4>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common persistent clinical tachyarrhythmia, is associated with altered gene transcription which underlies cardiomyocyte dysfunction, AF susceptibility and progression. Recent research showed class I and class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) to regulate pathological and fetal gene expression, and thereby induce hypertrophy and cardiac contractile dysfunction. Whether class I and class IIa HDACs are involved in AF promotion is unknown. We aim to elucidate the role of class I and class IIa HDACs in tachypacing-induced contractile dysfunction in experimental model systems for AF and clinical AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Class I and IIa HDACs were overexpressed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes followed by calcium transient (CaT) measurements. Overexpression of class I HDACs, HDAC1 or HDAC3, significantly reduced CaT amplitude in control normal-paced (1 Hz) cardiomyocytes, which was further reduced by tachypacing (5 Hz) in HDAC3 overexpressing cardiomyocytes. HDAC3 inhibition by shRNA or by the specific inhibitor, RGFP966, prevented contractile dysfunction in both tachypaced HL-1 cardiomyocytes and Drosophila prepupae. Conversely, overexpression of class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 or HDAC9) did not affect CaT in controls, with HDAC5 and HDAC7 overexpression even protecting against tachypacing-induced CaT loss. Notably, the protective effect of HDAC5 and HDAC7 was abolished in cardiomyocytes overexpressing a dominant negative HDAC5 or HDAC7 mutant, bearing a mutation in the binding domain for myosin enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Furthermore, tachypacing induced phosphorylation of HDAC5 and promoted its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm, leading to up-regulation of MEF2-related fetal gene expression (β-MHC, BNP). In accord, boosting nuclear localization of HDAC5 by MC1568 or Go6983 attenuated CaT loss in tachypaced HL-1 cardiomyocytes and preserved contractile function in Drosophila prepupae. Findings were expanded to clinical AF. Here, patients with AF showed a significant increase in expression levels and activity of HDAC3, phosphorylated HDAC5 and fetal genes (β-MHC, BNP) in atrial tissue compared to controls in sinus rhythm. CONCLUSION: Class I and class IIa HDACs display converse roles in AF progression. Whereas overexpression of Class I HDAC3 induces cardiomyocyte dysfunction, class IIa HDAC5 overexpression reveals protective properties. Accordingly, HDAC3 inhibitors and HDAC5 nuclear boosters show protection from tachypacing-induced changes and therefore may represent interesting therapeutic options in clinical AF.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in kidney damage in various pathologies, including acute and chronic kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy. In addition to the well-studied ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, hypothermia/rewarming (H/R) also inflicts acute kidney injury. Substituted 6-hydroxychromanols are a novel class of mitochondrial medicines that ameliorate mitochondrial oxidative stress and protect the mitochondrial network. To identify a novel 6-hydroxychromanol that protects mitochondrial structure and function in the kidney during H/R, we screened multiple compounds in vitro and subsequently assessed the efficacy of the 6-hydroxychromanol derivatives SUL-109 and SUL-121 in vivo to protect against kidney injury after H/R in rats.</AbstractText>: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in kidney damage in various pathologies, including acute and chronic kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy.

Selected compounds (SUL-109, SUL-121) or vehicle were administered to ketamine-anaesthetized male Wistar rats (IV 135 µg/kg/h) undergoing H/R at 15°C for 3 h followed by rewarming and normothermia for 1 h. Metabolic parameters and body temperature were measured throughout. In addition, renal function, renal injury, histopathology and mitochondrial fitness were assessed.</AbstractText>: Human proximal tubule cell viability was assessed following exposure to H/R for 48/4 h in the presence of various 6-hydroxychromanols.

SUL-109 and SUL-121 ameliorated tubular kidney damage, preserved mitochondrial mass and maintained cortical adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) levels, although SUL-121 did not reduce protein nitrosylation.</AbstractText>: H/R injury in vitro lowered cell viability by 94 ± 1%, which was counteracted dose-dependently by multiple 6-hydroxychomanols derivatives.

<p>BACKGROUND: Post-transplant tuberculosis (PTTB) is a serious opportunistic infection in renal graft recipients with a 30-70 fold higher incidence compared to the general population. PTTB occurs most frequently within the first years after transplantation, manifesting as pulmonary or disseminated TB. Gastrointestinal TB (GITB) is a rare and potentially lethal manifestation of PTTB and may show delayed onset in renal transplant recipients due to the use of lower doses of immunosuppressants. Further, non-specificity of symptoms and the common occurrence of GI disorders in transplant recipients may delay diagnosis of GITB.CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a rare survival case of isolated GITB in a renal transplant recipient, occurring seven years after transplantation. The patient’s condition was complicated by severe sepsis with positive blood culture Staphylococcus haemolyticus, septic shock, multiple organ failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute renal failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor circulatory support and intermittent hemodialysis. Furthermore, nosocomial infections such as invasive aspergillosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred during hospitalization. Antituberculosis therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) was initiated upon Mycobacterium confirmation. Moreover, treatment with voriconazole due to the Aspergillus flavus and meropenem due to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was initiated, the former necessitating discontinuation of rifampicin. After 34 days, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and was discharged to the pulmonary ward, followed by complete recovery.CONCLUSION: This case offers a guideline for the clinical management towards survival of GITB in transplant patients, complicated by septic shock and multiple organ failure, including acute renal injury and ARDS.</p>

<p>Hibernators show superior resistance to ischemia and hypothermia, also outside the hibernation season. Therefore, hibernation is a promising strategy to decrease cellular damage in a variety of fields, such as organ transplantation. Here, we explored the role of mitochondria herein, by comparing epithelial cell lines from a hibernator (hamster kidney cells, HaK) and a non-hibernator (human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293) during cold preservation at 4 °C and rewarming. Cell survival (Neutral Red), ATP and MDA levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial morphology (using fluorescent probes) and metabolism (seahorse XF) were assessed. Hypothermia induced dispersion of the tubular mitochondrial network, a loss of MMP, increased oxygen radical (MDA) and decreased ATP production in HEK293. In contrast, HaK maintained MMP and ATP production without an increase in oxygen radicals during cooling and rewarming, resulting in superior cell survival compared to HEK293. Further, normothermic HaK showed a dispersed mitochondrial network and higher respiratory and glycolysis capacity compared to HEK293. Disclosing the mechanisms that hibernators use to counteract cell death in hypothermic and ischemic circumstances may help to eventually improve organ preservation in a variety of fields, including organ transplantation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Derailment of proteostasis, the homeostasis of production, function, and breakdown of proteins, contributes importantly to the self-perpetuating nature of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common heart rhythm disorder in humans. Autophagy plays an important role in proteostasis by degrading aberrant proteins and organelles. Herein, we investigated the role of autophagy and its activation pathway in experimental and clinical AF.CONCLUSIONS: These results identify ER stress-associated autophagy as an important pathway in AF progression and demonstrate the potential therapeutic action of the ER-stress inhibitor 4-phenyl butyrate.</p>

<p>Hibernators tolerate low metabolism, reduced cerebral blood flow and hypothermia during torpor without noticeable neuronal or synaptic dysfunction upon arousal. Previous studies found extensive changes in brain during torpor, including synaptic rearrangements, documented both morphologically and molecularly. As such adaptations may represent organ damage, we anticipated an inflammatory response in brain during specific hibernation phases. In this study, signs of inflammation in the brain were investigated in the Syrian hamster hippocampus (Mesocricetus Auratus) both during hibernation (torpor and arousal phases) and in summer and winter euthermic animals. mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β was quantified by RT-qPCR. Morphological changes of microglia were studied by immunohistochemistry staining for IBA-1. Activation of microglia based on retraction and thickening of the dendritic branches and an increase in cell body size was quantified by calculation of cell body size to total cell size ratio. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was upregulated early in arousal (90 min), and normalized after 8 h of arousal. Substantial loss of microglia ramification was found throughout torpor and early arousal together with a 2-fold increase in the cell body size to total cell size ratio. Notably, microglia changes were fully reversed in late arousal (8 h) to euthermic levels. These results demonstrate an upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and signs of microglia activation during hibernation, which completely resolves by late arousal. Activation of this response may serve to prevent or offset brain damage resulting from the substantial physiological changes accompanying torpor and their rapid change during early arousal.</p>

<p>The incidence and prevalence of cardiac diseases, which are the main cause of death worldwide, are likely to increase because of population ageing. Prevailing theories about the mechanisms of ageing feature the gradual derailment of cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and loss of protein quality control as central factors. In the heart, loss of protein patency, owing to flaws in genetically-determined design or because of environmentally-induced ‘wear and tear’, can overwhelm protein quality control, thereby triggering derailment of proteostasis and contributing to cardiac ageing. Failure of protein quality control involves impairment of chaperones, ubiquitin-proteosomal systems, autophagy, and loss of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins, all of which relate to induction of cardiomyocyte senescence. Targeting protein quality control to maintain cardiac proteostasis offers a novel therapeutic strategy to promote cardiac health and combat cardiac disease. Currently marketed drugs are available to explore this concept in the clinical setting.</p>

<p>Although patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with nephropathy are at high risk for renal and cardiovascular complications, relevant biomarkers have been poorly identified. Because renal impairment may increase biomarker levels, this potentially confounds associations between biomarker levels and risk.

<p>Research on deep hibernators almost exclusively uses species captured from the wild or from local breeding. An exception is Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), the only standard laboratory animal showing deep hibernation. In deep hibernators, several factors influence hibernation quality, including body mass, sex and diet. We examined hibernation quality in commercially obtained Syrian hamsters in relation to body mass, sex and a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Animals (M/F:30/30, 12 weeks of age) were obtained from Harlan (IN, USA) and individually housed at 21 °C and L:D 14:10 until 20 weeks of age, followed by L:D 8:16 until 27 weeks. Then conditions were changed to 5 °C and L:D 0:24 for 9 weeks to induce hibernation. Movement was continuously monitored with passive infrared detectors. Hamsters were randomized to control diet or a diet 3× enriched in linoleic acid from 16 weeks of age. Hamsters showed a high rate of premature death (n = 24, 40%), both in animals that did and did not initiate torpor, which was unrelated to body weight, sex and diet. Time to death (31.7 ± 3.1 days, n = 12) or time to first torpor bout (36.6 ± 1.6 days, n = 12) was similar in prematurely deceased hamsters. Timing of induction of hibernation and duration of torpor and arousal was unaffected by body weight, sex or diet. Thus, commercially obtained Syrian hamsters subjected to winter conditions showed poor survival, irrespective of body weight, sex and diet. These factors also did not affect hibernation parameters. Possibly, long-term commercial breeding from a confined genetic background has selected against the hibernation trait.</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANCE: Therapeutic hypothermia is commonly applied to limit ischemic injury in organ transplantation, during cardiac and brain surgery and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In these procedures, the kidneys are particularly at risk for ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), likely due to their high rate of metabolism. Although hypothermia mitigates ischemic kidney injury, it is not a panacea. Residual mitochondrial failure is believed to be a key event triggering loss of cellular homeostasis, and potentially cell death. Subsequent rewarming generates large amounts of reactive oxygen species that aggravate organ injury. Recent Advances: Hibernators are able to withstand periods of profoundly reduced metabolism and body temperature (“torpor”), interspersed by brief periods of rewarming (“arousal”) without signs of organ injury. Specific adaptations allow maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, limit oxidative stress, and protect against cell death. These adaptations consist of active suppression of mitochondrial function and upregulation of anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-apoptotic pathways.CRITICAL ISSUES: Unraveling the precise molecular mechanisms that allow hibernators to cycle through torpor and arousal without precipitating organ injury may translate into novel pharmacological approaches to limit IRI in patients.</p>

<p>Encouraging advances in cell therapy research with adipose derived stem cells (ASC) require an effective short-term preservation method that provides time for quality control and transport of cells from their manufacturing facility to their clinical destination. Hypothermic storage of cells in their specific growth media offers an alternative and simple preservation method to liquid nitrogen cryopreservation or commercial preservation fluids for short-term storage and transport. However, accumulation of cell damage during hypothermia may result in cell injury and death upon rewarming through the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, the ability of the cell culture medium additive SUL-109, a modified 6-chromanol, to protect ASC from hypothermia and rewarming damage is examined. SUL-109 conveys protective effects against cold-induced damage in ASC as is observed by preservation of cell viability, adhesion properties and growth potential. SUL-109 does not reduce the multilineage differentiation capacity of ASC. SUL-109 conveys its protection against hypothermic damage by the preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential through the activation of mitochondrial membrane complexes I and IV, and increases maximal oxygen consumption in FCCP uncoupled mitochondria. Consequently, SUL-109 alleviates mitochondrial ROS production and preserves ATP production. In summary, here we describe the generation of a single molecule cell preservation agent that protects ASC from hypothermic damage associated with short-term cell preservation that does not affect the differentiation capacity of ASC.</p>

<p>Chronic transplant dysfunction (CTD) is the primary cause of late allograft loss in kidney transplantation. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is involved in fetomaternal tolerance and IDO gene therapy inhibits acute rejection following kidney transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether gene therapy with IDO is able to attenuate CTD. Transplantation was performed in a rat Dark-Agouti to Wistar-Furth CTD model. Donor kidneys were incubated either with an adenovirus carrying IDO gene, a control adenovirus or saline. During the first 10 days recipients received low-dose cyclosporine. Body weight, blood pressure, serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. Rats were killed after 12 weeks. IDO had a striking beneficial effect on transplant vasculopathy at week 12. It also significantly improved body weight gain; it reduced blood pressure and decreased proteinuria during the follow-up. However, it did not affect the kidney function. In addition, IDO therapy significantly decreased the number of graft-infiltrating macrophages at week 12. The messenger RNA levels of forkhead box p3 and transforming grow factor-β were elevated in the IDO treated group at week 12. Here we show for first time a clear beneficial effect of local IDO gene therapy especially on transplant vasculopathy in a rat model of renal CTD.</p>

<p>The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) analog FTY720 exerts pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system and causes down-regulation of S1P receptors. Myogenic constriction is an important mechanism regulating resistance vessel function and is known to be modulated by S1P. Here we investigated myogenic constriction and vascular function of mesenteric arteries of rats chronically treated with FTY720. Wistar rats received FTY720 1mg/kg/daily for six weeks. At termination, blood pressure was recorded and small mesenteric arteries collected for vascular studies in a perfusion set up. Myogenic constriction to increased intraluminal pressure was low, but a sub-threshold dose of S1P profoundly augmented myogenic constriction in arteries of both controls and animals chronically treated with FTY720. Interestingly, endothelial denudation blocked the response to S1P in arteries of FTY720-treated animals, but not in control rats. In acute experiments, presence of FTY720 significantly augmented the contractile response to S1P, an effect that was partially abolished after the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-)-derived prostaglandins. FTY720 down regulated S1P1 but not S1P2 in renal resistance arteries and in cultured human endothelial cells. This study therefore demonstrates the endothelium is able to compensate for the complete loss of responsiveness of the smooth muscle layer to S1P after long term FTY720 treatment through a mechanism that most likely involves enhanced production of contractile prostaglandins by the endothelium.</p>

<p>Age comprises the single most important risk factor for cardiac disease development. The incidence and prevalence of cardiac diseases, which represents the main cause of death worldwide, will increase even more because of the aging population. A hallmark of aging is that it is accompanied by a gradual derailment of proteostasis (eg, the homeostasis of protein synthesis, folding, assembly, trafficking, function, and degradation). Loss of proteostasis is highly relevant to cardiomyocytes, because they are postmitotic cells and therefore not constantly replenished by proliferation. The derailment of proteostasis during aging is thus an important factor that preconditions for the development of age-related cardiac diseases, such as atrial fibrillation. In turn, frailty of proteostasis in aging cardiomyocytes is exemplified by its accelerated derailment in multiple cardiac diseases. Here, we review 2 major components of the proteostasis network, the stress-responsive and protein degradation pathways, in healthy and aged cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we discuss the relation between derailment of proteostasis and age-related cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation. Finally, we introduce novel therapeutic targets that might possibly attenuate cardiac aging and thus limit cardiac disease progression.</p>

<p>Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by an intraluminal filament is widely used to study focal brain ischemia in male Sprague-Dawley rats. However, permanent occlusion goes along with a high fatality. To overcome this drawback we designed a new filament carrying a bowling pin-shaped tip (BP-tip) and compared this with three conventionally tipped filaments. Follow-up periods were 24 h (all groups) and 72 and 120 h in BP-tip group. Ischemic damage and swelling were quantified using silver nitrate staining. Collateral flow via the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was assessed using selective dye perfusion of the internal carotid artery. Despite a comparable decrease of brain perfusion in all groups, ischemic damage was significantly smaller in BP-tips (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, BP-tip significantly reduced mortality from 60% to 12.5% and widely spared the occipital region and hypothalamus from ischemic damage. Conventional but not BP-tip filaments induced vascular distortion, measured as gross displacement of the MCA origin, which correlated with occipital infarction size. Accordingly, BP-tip occluded rats showed a significantly better collateral filling of the PCA territory. Ischemic volume significantly increased in BP-tip occlusion at 72 h follow-up. BP-tip filaments offer superior survival in permanent MCA occlusion, while mimicking the course of a malignant stroke in patients.</p>

<p>COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, neutrophilia and oxidative stress from endogenous and exogenous insults. Current COPD therapy involving anticholinergics, β2-adrenoceptor agonists and/or corticosteroids, do not specifically target oxidative stress, nor do they reduce chronic pulmonary inflammation and disease progression in all patients. Here, we explore the effects of Sul-121, a novel compound with anti-oxidative capacity, on hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation in experimental models of COPD. Using a guinea pig model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neutrophilia, we demonstrated that Sul-121 inhalation dose-dependently prevented LPS-induced airway neutrophilia (up to ~60%) and AHR (up to ~90%). Non-cartilaginous airways neutrophilia was inversely correlated with blood H2S, and LPS-induced attenuation of blood H2S (~60%) was prevented by Sul-121. Concomitantly, Sul-121 prevented LPS-induced production of the oxidative stress marker, malondialdehyde by ~80%. In immortalized human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, Sul-121 dose-dependently prevented cigarette smoke extract-induced IL-8 release parallel with inhibition of nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit, p65 (each ~90%). Sul-121 also diminished cellular reactive oxygen species production in ASM cells, and inhibited nuclear translocation of the anti-oxidative response regulator, Nrf2. Our data show that Sul-121 effectively inhibits airway inflammation and AHR in experimental COPD models, prospectively through inhibition of oxidative stress.</p>

<p>In healthy rats, the physiological variation of baseline endothelial function of intrarenal arteries correlates with the severity of renal damage in response to a subsequent specific renal injury. However, whether such a variation in endothelial function may also condition or predict the variable response to angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibiting treatment in these individuals has not been addressed before. To study this, 5/6 nephrectomy was performed to induce renal injury and chronic kidney disease in a group of healthy Wistar rats. At the time of nephrectomy, interlobar arteries were obtained from the extirpated right kidney and studied in vitro for endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. Six weeks thereafter, treatment with lisinopril was started (n = 11) and continued for 9 wk. Proteinuria (metabolic cages) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; tail cuff) were evaluated weekly, and these were analyzed in relation to renal endothelial function at baseline. 5/6 Nephrectomy induced an increase in SBP and progressive proteinuria. Treatment with lisinopril reduced SBP and slowed proteinuria, albeit to a variable degree among individuals. The acetylcholine-induced renal artery dilation at baseline negatively correlated with lisinopril-induced reduction of proteinuria (r(2) = 0.648, P = 0.003) and with the decrease in SBP (r(2) = 0.592, P = 0.006). Our data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor attenuates the progression of renal damage the most in those individuals with decreased basal renal endothelial-mediated vasodilation.</p>

<p>Cardiomyocytes are long-lived post-mitotic cells with limited regenerative capacity. Proper cardiomyocyte function depends critically on the maintenance of a healthy homeostasis of protein expression, folding, assembly, trafficking, function, and degradation, together commonly referred to as proteostasis. Impairment of proteostasis has a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. Emerging evidence reveals also a role for impaired proteostasis in the pathophysiology of common human cardiac diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy, dilated and ischaemic cardiomyopathies, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have recently been recognized as key modulators which control cardiac proteostasis by deacetylating various proteins. By deacetylating chromatin proteins, including histones, HDACs modulate epigenetic regulation of pathological gene expression. Also, HDACs exert a broad range of functions outside the nucleus by deacetylating structural and contractile proteins. The cytosolic actions of HDACs result in changed protein function through post-translational modifications and/or modulation of their degradation. This review describes the mechanisms underlying the derailment of proteostasis in AF and subsequently focuses on the role of HDACs herein. In addition, the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition to maintain a healthy proteostasis resulting in a delay in AF onset and progression is discussed.</p>

<p>Hypothermia and rewarming produces organ injury through the production of reactive oxygen species. We previously found that dopamine prevents hypothermia and rewarming-induced apoptosis in cultured cells through increased expression of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine β-Synthase (CBS). Here, we investigate whether dopamine protects the kidney in deep body cooling and explore the role of H2S-producing enzymes in an in vivo rat model of deep hypothermia and rewarming. In anesthetized Wistar rats, body temperature was decreased to 15°C for 3h, followed by rewarming for 1h. Rats (n≥5 per group) were treated throughout the procedure with vehicle or dopamine infusion, and in the presence or absence of a non-specific inhibitor of H2S-producing enzymes, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA). Kidney damage and renal expression of three H2S-producing enzymes (CBS, CSE and 3-MST) was quantified and serum H2S level measured. Hypothermia and rewarming induced renal damage, evidenced by increased serum creatinine, renal reactive oxygen species production, KIM-1 expression and influx of immune cells, which was accompanied by substantially lowered renal expression of CBS, CSE, and 3-MST and lowered serum H2S levels. Infusion of dopamine fully attenuated renal damage and maintained expression of H2S-producing enzymes, while normalizing serum H2S. AOAA further decreased the expression of H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S level, and aggravated renal damage. Hence, dopamine preserves renal integrity during deep hypothermia and rewarming likely by maintaining the expression of renal H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia is used to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) during organ transplantation and major surgery, but does not fully prevent organ injury. Interestingly, hibernating animals undergo repetitive periods of low body temperature called ‘torpor’ without signs of organ injury. Recently, we identified an essential role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in entrance into torpor and preservation of kidney integrity during hibernation. A torpor-like state can be induced pharmacologically by injecting 5’-Adenosine monophosphate (5’-AMP). The mechanism by which 5’-AMP leads to the induction of a torpor-like state, and the role of H2S herein, remains to be unraveled. Therefore, we investigated whether induction of a torpor-like state by 5-AMP depends on H2S production.METHODS: To study the role of H2S on the induction of torpor, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA), a non-specific inhibitor of H2S, was administered before injection with 5’-AMP to block endogenous H2S production in Syrian hamster. To assess the role of H2S on maintenance of torpor induced by 5’-AMP, additional animals were injected with AOAA during torpor.KEY RESULTS: During the torpor-like state induced by 5’-AMP, the expression of H2S- synthesizing enzymes in the kidneys and plasma levels of H2S were increased. Blockade of these enzymes inhibited the rise in the plasma level of H2S, but neither precluded torpor nor induced arousal. Remarkably, blockade of endogenous H2S production was associated with increased renal injury.CONCLUSIONS: Induction of a torpor-like state by 5’-AMP does not depend on H2S, although production of H2S seems to attenuate renal injury. Unraveling the mechanisms by which 5’-AMP reduces the metabolism without organ injury may allow optimization of current strategies to limit (hypothermic) IRI and improve outcome following organ transplantation, major cardiac and brain surgery.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved program of stress-induced gene expression, aimed at reestablishing protein homeostasis to preserve cellular fitness. Cells that fail to activate or maintain this protective response are hypersensitive to proteotoxic stress. The HSR is mediated by the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which binds to conserved heat shock elements (HSE) in the promoter region of heat shock genes, resulting in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP). Recently, we observed that hyperactivation of RhoA conditions cardiomyocytes for the cardiac arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. Also, the HSR is annihilated in atrial fibrillation, and induction of HSR mitigates sensitization of cells to this disease. Therefore, we hypothesized active RhoA to suppress the HSR resulting in sensitization of cells for proteotoxic stimuli.METHODS AND RESULTS: Stimulation of RhoA activity significantly suppressed the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR in HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes as determined with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the HSF1 regulated human HSP70 (HSPA1A) promoter and HSP protein expression by Western Blot analysis. Inversely, RhoA inhibition boosted the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR. While active RhoA did not preclude HSF1 nuclear accumulation, phosphorylation, acetylation, or sumoylation, it did impair binding of HSF1 to the hsp genes promoter element HSE. Impaired binding results in suppression of HSP expression and sensitized cells to proteotoxic stress.CONCLUSION: These results reveal that active RhoA negatively regulates the HSR via attenuation of the HSF1-HSE binding and thus may play a role in sensitizing cells to proteotoxic stimuli.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Chronic transplant dysfunction (CTD) is the leading cause of long-term loss of the renal allograft. So far, no single test is available to reliably predict the risk for CTD. Monitoring of tryptophan (trp) metabolism through indoleamine 2.3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been previously proposed to predict acute rejection of human kidney transplants. Here, we investigate the potential of IDO/trp degradation along the kynurenine (kyn) pathway to predict the long-term outcome of human kidney transplantation.METHODS: During the 2-year follow-up blood, urine, and kidney biopsies were collected from 48 renal transplant patients. Concentrations of kyn and trp in serum and urine were measured at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after transplantation. Kynurenine to tryptophan ratio was calculated as an estimate of trp degradation. To evaluate the histological changes and IDO expression, respectively, periodic acid schiff staining and immunohistochemistry for IDO were performed on biopsies taken at 6 months and 2 years.RESULTS: Two years after transplantation, kyn/trp was increased in urine and decreased in serum as compared to 2-week values. In 2-year biopsies, IDO expression was mainly found in infiltrating inflammatory cells and in the glomeruli. The urine level of trp 2 weeks after transplantation predicted the serum creatinine 6 months and the estimated creatinine clearance 2 years after transplantation. Additionally, serum level of kyn 6 months after transplantation predicted the serum creatinine 2 years after transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Early serum and urine levels of trp and kyn may offer a novel route for early detection of patients at risk for developing CTD.</p>

<p>It has been firmly established that ageing constitutes a principal risk factor for cardiac disease. Currently, the underlying mechanisms of ageing that contribute to the initiation or acceleration of cardiac disease are essentially unresolved. Prevailing theories of ageing center on the loss of cellular protein homeostasis, by either design (genetically) or “wear and tear” (environmentally). Either or both ways, the normal protein homeostasis in the cell is affected, resulting in aberrant and misfolded proteins. Should such misfolded proteins escape the protein quality control (PQC) system, they become proteotoxic and accelerate the loss of cellular integrity. Impairment of PQC plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ageing-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s, Huntington׳s, and Alzheimer׳s disease. The concept of an impaired PQC driving ageing-related diseases has recently been expanded to cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the PQC system in relation to ageing and discuss the emerging concept of the loss of PQC in cardiomyocytes as a trigger for cardiac disease. Finally, we discuss the potential of boosting the PQC system as an innovative therapeutic target to treat cardiac disease in the elderly.</p>

<p>The case of a 55-year-old man who attempted suicide by ingesting &lt;100 mL of 28% sodium chlorite solution is presented. On arrival in the intensive care unit, the patient appeared cyanotic with lowered consciousness and displayed anuria and chocolate brown serum.Initial laboratory tests revealed 40% of methemoglobin. The formation of methemoglobin was effectively treated with methylene blue (10% after 29 hours).To remove the toxin, and because of the anuric acute renal failure, the patient received renal replacement therapy. Despite these therapeutic measures, the patient developed hemolytic anemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which were treated with red blood cell transfusion and intermittent hemodialysis. These interventions led to the improvement of his condition and the patient eventually fully recovered. Patient gave written informed consent.This is the third known case of chlorite poisoning that has been reported. Based upon this case, we suggest the management of sodium chlorite poisoning to comprise the early administration of methylene blue, in addition to renal replacement therapy and transfusion of red blood cells.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may induce systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) modulates various vascular and immune responses. Here we explored whether agonists of the S1P receptors, FTY720 and SEW2871 improve vascular reactivity after CPB in the rat.METHODS: Experiments were done in male Wistar rats (total n = 127). Anesthesia was induced by isoflurane (2.5-3%) and maintained by fentanyl and midazolam during CPB. After catheterization of the left femoral artery, carotid artery and the right atrium, normothermic extracorporeal circulation was instituted for 60 minutes. In the first part of the study animals were euthanized after either 1 hour, 1 day, 2 or 5 days of the recovery period. In second part of the study animals were euthanized after 1 day of postoperative period. We evaluated the contractile response to phenylephrine (mesenteric arteries) or to serotonin (coronary artery) and vasodilatory response to acethylcholine (both arteries).RESULTS: Contractile responses to phenylephrine were reduced at 1 day recovery after CPB and Sham as compared to healthy control animals (Emax, mN: 7.9 ± 1.9, 6.5 ± 1.5, and 11.3 ± 1.3, respectively). Mainly FTY720, but not SEW2871, caused lymphopenia in both Sham and CPB groups. In coronary and mesenteric arteries, both FTY720 and SEW2871 normalized serotonin and phenylephrine-mediated vascular reactivity after CPB (p&lt;0.05) and FTY720 increased relaxation to acetylcholine as compared with untreated rats that underwent CPB.CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with FTY720 or SEW2871 preserves vascular function in mesenteric and coronary artery after CPB. Therefore, pharmacological activation of S1P1 receptors may provide a promising therapeutic intervention to prevent CPB-related vascular dysfunction in patients.</p>

<p>Hibernation is an energy-conserving behavior in winter characterized by two phases: torpor and arousal. During torpor, markedly reduced metabolic activity results in inactivity and decreased body temperature. Arousal periods intersperse the torpor bouts and feature increased metabolism and euthermic body temperature. Alterations in physiological parameters, such as suppression of hemostasis, are thought to allow hibernators to survive periods of torpor and arousal without organ injury. While the state of torpor is potentially procoagulant, due to low blood flow, increased viscosity, immobility, hypoxia, and low body temperature, organ injury due to thromboembolism is absent. To investigate platelet dynamics during hibernation, we measured platelet count and function during and after natural torpor, pharmacologically induced torpor and forced hypothermia. Splenectomies were performed to unravel potential storage sites of platelets during torpor. Here we show that decreasing body temperature drives thrombocytopenia during torpor in hamster with maintained functionality of circulating platelets. Interestingly, hamster platelets during torpor do not express P-selectin, but expression is induced by treatment with ADP. Platelet count rapidly restores during arousal and rewarming. Platelet dynamics in hibernation are not affected by splenectomy before or during torpor. Reversible thrombocytopenia was also induced by forced hypothermia in both hibernating (hamster) and non-hibernating (rat and mouse) species without changing platelet function. Pharmacological torpor induced by injection of 5’-AMP in mice did not induce thrombocytopenia, possibly because 5’-AMP inhibits platelet function. The rapidness of changes in the numbers of circulating platelets, as well as marginal changes in immature platelet fractions upon arousal, strongly suggest that storage-and-release underlies the reversible thrombocytopenia during natural torpor. Possibly, margination of platelets, dependent on intrinsic platelet functionality, governs clearance of circulating platelets during torpor.</p>

In the present study, metabolic parameters, blood pressure, aortic endothelial function along with molecular and structural markers of glomerular and tubulointerstitial renal damage, were studied in a rat model of normotensive nephropathy induced by adriamycin and treated with PPARγ agonist pioglitazone (12mg/kg, po), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (1mg/kg, po) or their combination. Pioglitazone had no effect on systolic blood pressure, marginally reduced glycemia and improved aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation. In the kidney, pioglitazone prevented the development of proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis to the similar extent as blood-pressure lowering ramipril. Renoprotection provided by either treatment was associated with a reduction in the cortical expression of profibrotic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and microvascular damage-inducing endothelin-1, and a limitation of interstitial macrophage influx. Treatment with PPARγ agonist, as well as ACE inhibitor comparably affected renal expression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, normalizing increased renal expression of ACE and enhancing the expression of Mas receptor. Interestingly, combined pioglitazone and ramipril treatment did not provide any additional renoprotection. These results demonstrate that in a nondiabetic renal disease, such as adriamycin-induced nephropathy, PPARγ agonist pioglitazone provides renoprotection to a similar extent as an ACE inhibitor by interfering with the expression of local RAS components and attenuating related profibrotic and inflammatory mechanisms. The combination of the both agents, however, does not lead to any additional renal benefit.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is the main contributor to the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the brain. Exogenously administered H2S has been reported to protect neurons against hypoxic injury, ischemia and LPS-induced neuro-inflammation and in the facilitating of long term potentiation (LTP). Dysregulation of CBS leads to different diseases, which all have mental retardation in common. Although multiple studies have implicated a link between the CBS/H2S pathway and neurodegeneration, no studies have been performed examining the pathway in healthy aging animals. We hypothesize that CBS/H2S pathway plays an important role in the protection of learning and memory functions in the brain at the level of the hippocampus. Thus, we studied a set of 8 young (4 months) and 14 aged (24 months (n=6) and 28 months (n=8)) C57Bl6 mice. The 24-month-old mice displayed a significant decrease of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG only, compared to 4-month-old mice. In 28-month-old mice, we observed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG, compared to 4-month-old mice. When comparing 28-month-old mice to 24-month-old mice, all areas showed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity. Thus, throughout aging, CBS expression is maintained in the hippocampus, and many other forebrain regions as well. Mice at the unusual age of 28 months even have a higher hippocampal CBS expression than young mice. Maintenance (and increase) of CBS levels may sustain memory and learning by precluding neuronal loss in areas of the hippocampus.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Diabetes and particularly high blood glucose levels are implicated in neurodegeneration. One of the hallmarks of neurodegeneration is protein aggregation. We investigated the presence of protein aggregation in the frontal brain of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, an animal model for diabetes. Further, the effect of NaHS in suppressing protein aggregation in cultured brain slices from ZDF was assessed.RESULTS: The levels of protein synthesis, protein/gene expression, autophagy and anti-oxidant defense were evaluated in ZDF and control (Lean) brains.Compared to Lean, ZDF brains displayed a significant increase in protein aggregates, p-tau, fibronectin expression and protein glycosylation. Increased phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 ribosomal protein in ZDF indicated higher protein synthesis, while the increase in ubiquitinated proteins and LC3-I in ZDF brains accompanied by lower LC3-II expression and LC3-II/LC3-I levels indicated the blockage of proteolytic pathways. CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) protein and mRNA expression and thiol group levels in ZDF brains were lower compared to Lean. ZDF brains show a higher level of reactive oxygen species. In vitro NaHS treatment normalized proteostasis while counteracting oxidative stress.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate increased protein synthesis and aggregation in the diabetic ZDF rat brain, which was reversible by NaHS treatment.This is the first report on the potential use of NaHS as a novel strategy against protein aggregation in diabetic brain.</p>

<p>Ultrasound and microbubble-targeted delivery (UMTD) is a promising non-viral technique for genetic-based therapy. We found that UMTD of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is more effective than delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA). UMTD (1 MHz, 0.22 MPa) of fluorescently labeled siRNA resulted in 97.9 ± 1.5% transfected cells, with siRNA localized homogenously in the cytoplasm directly after ultrasound exposure. UMTD of fluorescently labeled pDNA resulted in only 43.0 ± 4.2% transfected cells, with localization mainly in vesicular structures, co-localizing with endocytosis markers clathrin and caveolin. Delivery of siRNA against GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) effectively decreased protein levels to 24.3 ± 7.9% of non-treated controls (p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, 24 h after delivery of pDNA encoding GAPDH, no increase in protein levels was detected. Transfection efficiency, verified with red fluorescently labeled pDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein, revealed that of the transfected cells, only 2.0 ± 0.7% expressed the transgene. In conclusion, the difference in localization between siRNA and pDNA after UMTD is an important determinant of the effectiveness of these genetic-based technologies.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: We investigated endothelial dysfunction and the role of angiotensin (Ang)-II type I (AT1-R) and type II (AT2-R) receptor in the changes in the Ang-II sensitivity in experimental preeclampsia in the rat.METHODS: Aortic rings were isolated from low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infused pregnant rats (experimental preeclampsia; n=9), saline-infused pregnant rats (n=8), and saline (n=8) and LPS (n=8) infused non-pregnant rats. Endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was studied in phenylephrine-preconstricted aortic rings in the presence of vehicle, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and/or indomethacin. To evaluate the role for AT1-R and AT2-R in Ang-II sensitivity, full concentration response curves were obtained for Ang-II in the presence of losartan or PD123319. mRNA expression of the AT1-R and AT2-R, eNOS and iNOS, COX1 and COX2 in aorta were evaluated using real-time RT-PCR.RESULTS: The role of vasodilator prostaglandins in the aorta was increased and the role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and response of the AT1-R and AT2-R to Ang-II was decreased in pregnant saline infused rats as compared with non-pregnant rats. These changes were not observed during preeclampsia.CONCLUSION: Pregnancy induced adaptations in endothelial function, which were not observed in the rat model for preeclampsia. This role of lack of pregnancy induced endothelial adaptation in the pathophysiology of experimental preeclampsia needs further investigation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by structural remodeling, contractile dysfunction, and AF progression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence acetylation of both histones and cytosolic proteins, thereby mediating epigenetic regulation and influencing cell proteostasis. Because the exact function of HDACs in AF is unknown, we investigated their role in experimental and clinical AF models.METHODS AND RESULTS: Tachypacing of HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila pupae hearts significantly impaired contractile function (amplitude of Ca(2+) transients and heart wall contractions). This dysfunction was prevented by inhibition of HDAC6 (tubacin) and sirtuins (nicotinamide). Tachypacing induced specific activation of HDAC6, resulting in α-tubulin deacetylation, depolymerization, and degradation by calpain. Tachypacing-induced contractile dysfunction was completely rescued by dominant-negative HDAC6 mutants with loss of deacetylase activity in the second catalytic domain, which bears α-tubulin deacetylase activity. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubastatin A protected atrial tachypaced dogs from electric remodeling (action potential duration shortening, L-type Ca(2+) current reduction, AF promotion) and cellular Ca(2+)-handling/contractile dysfunction (loss of Ca(2+) transient amplitude, sarcomere contractility). Finally, atrial tissue from patients with AF also showed a significant increase in HDAC6 activity and reduction in the expression of both acetylated and total α-tubulin.CONCLUSIONS: AF induces remodeling and loss of contractile function, at least in part through HDAC6 activation and subsequent derailment of α-tubulin proteostasis and disruption of the cardiomyocyte microtubule structure. In vivo inhibition of HDAC6 protects against AF-related atrial remodeling, disclosing the potential of HDAC6 as a therapeutic target in clinical AF.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is associated with a decrease in renal myogenic tone - part of renal autoregulatory mechanisms. Novel class of drugs used for the treatment of T2DM, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, have protective effects on the cardiovascular system. A Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat is an animal model of T2DM that displays progressive nephropathy in which inflammation leads to initiation of renal fibrosis and CKD. We hypothesized that CKD in the ZDF rat is related to decrease in myogenic constriction (MC) of intrarenal arteries and that treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor, vildagliptin, prevents such changes. Renal arteries isolated from 25 weeks old lean, ZDF and ZDF treated with vildagliptin (n=7 in each group) were transferred to an arteriograph to assess agonist and pressure induced contractile responses. Furthermore, blood glucose, proteinuria, focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) and p22phox mRNA expression of renal tissue were measured. Compared to lean controls, ZDF had significantly increased plasma glucose and cholesterol levels, focal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial α-SMA expression, and urinary protein excretion. ZDF rats also had impaired MC of renal arteries and increased renal p22phox expression. Vildagliptin did not affect plasma glucose levels or proteinuria, but effectively decreased glomerulosclerosis and restored MC and p22phox expression to the levels found in lean rats. Based on these data, it can be suggested that vildagliptin treatment protects diabetic rats from the loss of renal vascular reactivity and the development of glomerulosclerosis perhaps secondary to a reduction in oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is emerging as valuable biomarker in cardiovascular disease and diabetic kidney disease. Also, GDF15 represents an early response gene induced after tissue injury and studies performed in GDF15 knockout (KO) mice suggest that GDF15 plays a protective role after injury. In the current study, we investigated the role of GDF15 in the development of diabetic kidney damage in type 1 and type 2 models of diabetes. Renal damage was assessed in GDF15 KO mice and wild-type (WT) mice in streptozotocin type 1 and db/db type 2 diabetic models. Genetic deletion of GDF15 augmented tubular and interstitial damage in both models of diabetes, despite similar diabetic states in KO and WT mice. Increased tubular damage in KO animals was associated with increased glucosuria and polyuria in both type 1 and type 2 models of diabetes. In both models of diabetes, KO mice showed increased interstitial damage as indicated by increased α-smooth muscle actin staining and collagen type 1 expression. In contrast, glomerular damage was similarly elevated in diabetic KO and WT mice. In type 1 diabetes, GDF15 KO mice demonstrated increased expression of inflammatory markers. In type 2 diabetes, elevated levels of plasma creatinine indicated impaired kidney function in KO mice. GDF15 protects the renal interstitium and tubular compartment in experimental type 1 and 2 diabetes without affecting glomerular damage.</p>

<p>Transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by α1-adrenoceptor (α1-AR) is implicated in contraction and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle (VSM). We examine whether all α1-AR subtypes transactivate EGFR and explore the mechanism of transactivation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing one subtype of α1-AR were transiently transfected with EGFR. The transactivation mechanism was examined both by coexpression of a chimeric erythropoietin (EPO)-EGFR with an extracellular EPO and intracellular EGFR domain, and by pharmacologic inhibition of external and internal signaling routes. All three α1-AR subtypes transactivated EGFR, which was dependent on the increase in intracellular calcium. The EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 [4-(3’-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline] abrogated α1A-AR and α1D-AR induced phosphorylation of EGFR, but both the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases by GM6001 [(R)-N4-hydroxy-N(1)-[(S)-2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-methylcarbamoyl-ethyl]-2-isobutyl-succinamide] or blockade of EGFR by cetuximab did not. Stimulation of α1A-AR and α1D-AR also induced phosphorylation of EPO-EGFR chimeric receptors. Moreover, α1A-AR stimulation enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and serine-threonine kinases (Akt), which were both unaffected by AG1478, indicating that ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation is independent of EGFR transactivation. Accordingly, inhibitors of ERK1/2 or Akt did not influence the α1A-AR-mediated EGFR transactivation. Inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Src, however, did block EGFR transactivation by α1A-AR and α1D-AR. These findings demonstrate that all α1-AR subtypes transactivate EGFR, which is dependent on an intracellular signaling route involving an increase in calcium and activation of CaMKII, PI3K, and Src, but not the of ERK1/2 and Akt pathways.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Intact myogenic constriction plays a role in renal blood flow autoregulation and protection against pressure-related (renal) injury. However, to what extent alterations in renal artery myogenic constriction are involved in development of renal damage during aging is unknown. Therefore, we studied two strains of fawn-hooded rats, which differ in expression of hypertension and chronic renal failure.METHODS: Ten-week-old fawn-hooded hypertensive (FHH) and fawn-hooded low blood pressure (FHL) rats were followed for SBP and proteinuria for 1 year. At 52 weeks of age, the kidney was removed and studied for focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) and glomerular cross-sectional area, and myogenic constriction of isolated small renal arteries in a vessel perfusion set up. Renal myogenic constriction and FGS were additionally determined in 10-week-old fawn-hooded rats.RESULTS: At young age, fawn-hooded rats did not differ in SBP, FGS, and urinary protein excretion, but renal artery myogenic constriction already was significantly smaller (∼50%) in FHH compared with FHL rats. Aging in fawn-hooded rats was associated with increase in SBP and urinary protein excretion and loss of renal artery myogenic constriction. These changes occurred in both fawn-hooded strains, although that in FHH rats the onset of hypertension occurred earlier and the increase in proteinuria by far exceeded (&gt;4 times) that observed in FHL rats, and came along with 5.5 times increase in FGS and 1.3 times increase in glomerular cross-sectional area and significantly less preserved renal artery myogenic constriction in FHH rats.CONCLUSION: Better preservation of renal myogenic constriction protects the kidney from age-related hypertensive renal damage in the fawn-hooded rat.</p>

<p>Hibernation consists of periods of low metabolism, called torpor, interspersed by euthermic arousal periods. During deep and daily (shallow) torpor, the number of circulating leukocytes decreases, although circulating cells, is restored to normal numbers upon arousal. Here, we show that neutropenia, during torpor, is solely a result of lowering of body temperature, as a reduction of circulating also occurred following forced hypothermia in summer euthermic hamsters and rats that do not hibernate. Splenectomy had no effect on reduction in circulating neutrophils during torpor. Margination of neutrophils to vessel walls appears to be the mechanism responsible for reduced numbers of neutrophils in hypothermic animals, as the effect is inhibited by pretreatment with dexamethasone. In conclusion, low body temperature in species that naturally use torpor or in nonhibernating species under forced hypothermia leads to a decrease of circulating neutrophils as a result of margination. These findings may be of clinical relevance, as they could explain, at in least part, the benefits and drawbacks of therapeutic hypothermia as used in trauma patients and during major surgery.</p>

<p>Werner syndrome (WS) protein is involved in DNA repair and its truncation causes Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with a premature aging phenotype. WRN protein mutation is currently known as the primary cause of WS. In cultured WS fibroblasts, we found an increase in cytosolic aggregates and hypothesized that the phenotype is indirectly related to an excess activation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, leading to the formation of protein aggregates in the cytosol with increasing levels of oxidative stress. As we found that the expression levels of the two main H2S producing enzymes, cystathionine β synthase and cystathionine γ lyase, were lower in WS cells compared to normal, we investigated the effect of administration of H2S as NaHS (50μM). NaHS treatment blocked mTOR activity, abrogated protein aggregation and normalized the phenotype of WS cells. Similar results were obtained by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. This is the first report suggesting that hydrogen sulfide administered as NaHS restores proteostasis and cellular morphological phenotype of WS cells and hints to the importance of transsulfuration pathway in WS.</p>

<p>Natural hibernation consists of torpid phases with metabolic suppression alternating with euthermic periods. Induction of torpor holds substantial promise in various medical conditions, including trauma, major surgery, and transplantation. Torpor in mice can be induced pharmacologically by 5’-AMP. Previously, we showed that during natural torpor, the reduction in body temperature results in lymphopenia via a reduction in plasma S1P. Here, we show that during torpor induced by 5’-AMP, there is a similar reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes that is a result of their retention in secondary lymphoid organs. This lymphopenia could be mimicked by engagement of A(2B)Rs by a selective A(2B)R agonist (LUF6210) in the absence of changes in temperature and prevented by A(2B)R antagonists during 5’-AMP-induced torpor. In addition, forced cooling of mice led to peripheral blood lymphopenia, independent of A(2B)R signaling. The induction of torpor using 5’-AMP impacted the migration of lymphocytes within and between secondary lymphoid organs. During torpor, the homing into LNs was impaired, and two-photon intravital microscopy revealed that cell motility was decreased significantly and rapidly upon 5’-AMP administration. Furthermore, the S1P plasma concentration was reduced by 5’-AMP but not by LUF6210. S1P plasma levels restored upon arousal. Likely, the reduced migration in LNs combined with the reduced S1P plasma level substantially reduces lymphocyte egress after injection of 5’-AMP. In conclusion, 5’-AMP induces a state of pharmacological torpor in mice, during which, lymphopenia is governed primarily by body temperature-independent suppression of lymphocyte egress from LNs.</p>

<p>Transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by G protein-coupled receptors has been implicated in several cardiovascular (CV) conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, and cardiac and vascular hypertrophy. However, the therapeutic potential of EGFR inhibition in these conditions is currently unknown. The main objective of the present study was to investigate cardiac, vascular, and renal effects of EGFR inhibition by 4-[4-[[(1R)-1-phenylethyl]amino]-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl]phenol (PKI-166) in the hypertensive chronic kidney disease model. Rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) and were treated with PKI-166, lisinopril or vehicle from week 6 after disease induction until week 12. Sham animals received either PKI-166 or vehicle. Treatment with PKI-166 did not affect the development of the characteristic renal features in 5/6Nx, including proteinuria, diminished creatinine clearance, and increased glomerulosclerosis, whereas these were attenuated by lisinopril. Despite absence of effects on progressive renal damage, PKI-166 attenuated the progression of hypertension and maintained cardiac function (left ventricle end-diastolic pressure) to a similar extent as lisinopril. Also, PKI-166 attenuated the increase in phosphorylated EGFR in the heart as induced by 5/6Nx. Moreover, PKI-166 and lisinopril restored the impaired contraction of isolated thoracic aortic rings to phenylephrine and angiotensin II and impaired myogenic constriction of small mesenteric arteries in 5/6Nx rats. Blockade of the EGFR displays a CV benefit independent of limiting the progression of renal injury. Our findings extend the evidence on EGFR signaling as a target in CV disorders.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Microarrays have become the standard technique for discovering new genes involved in the development of (kidney) disease. Diabetic nephropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes and is characterized by renal fibrosis. As the pathways leading to fibrosis are initiated early in diabetes and in the current study, we aimed at identifying genes associated with renal fibrosis in the first week after induction of diabetes in the rat streptozotocin (STZ) model.METHODS: Conventional microarray analysis methods comparing gene expression to a common reference are not very suitable for time series as gene lists for all time point are very heterogeneous. We therefore sought an analysis technique that would allow us to easily find genes that we either substantially up or down regulated during the first week of diabetes. In the new method, the normalized expression of individual genes was plotted in time. Subsequently, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to quantify the overall level of changes in expression of individual genes.RESULTS: AUCs for all genes were plotted in a histogram showing a normal distribution with a mean of close to 0, indicating no change in expression for the majority of genes. Genes with AUCs outside 3 standard deviations of the mean were considered significantly different from control.DISCUSSION: Using this technique, a total of 290 genes were found to be significantly changed in the first week of diabetes. Data on a subset of genes were confirmed by real-time PCR, indicating the validity of the employed new analysis method.</p>

<p>CONTEXT: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a commonly used technique in cardiac surgery but is associated with acute, transient, renal dysfunction that has a negative impact on long-term survival.OBJECTIVE: To unravel the molecular pathogenesis of renal injury following CPB.DESIGN: To obtain insight into the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction following CPB, we performed a microarray analysis of renal gene expression in the rat.SETTING: University Medical Centre Groningen.INTERVENTION: Rats underwent CPB or a sham procedure for 60 min and were sacrificed at 60 min, 1 and 5 days after the procedure.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Renal gene expression profile as determined by microarray analysis.RESULTS: Expression of 420 genes was significantly altered in CPB compared to the sham procedure, and in 407 genes, this was evident in the acute phase (60 min) following CPB. Gene ontology analysis revealed 28 of these genes were involved in inflammatory responses, with high expression of genes downstream of mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAP-kinase) signalling pathways. Potent inducers identified are from the interleukin-6 cytokine family that consists of interleukin-6 and oncostatin M (OSM), which signal through the gp130-cytokine receptor complex. The plasma concentration of interleukin-6 was hugely increased by CPB as measured by ELISA. Expression of genes downstream of these signalling pathways that lead to production of chemokines, adhesion molecules and molecules involved in coagulative pathways, was upregulated.CONCLUSION: CPB induces an acute and local inflammatory response in the kidney, which might contribute to renal injury. The signalling pathways involved identified by gene expression analysis may represent pharmacological targets to limit renal injury following CPB.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Rat models of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have been used to examine the mechanisms of associated organ damage and to test intervention strategies. However, these models only partly mimic the clinical situation, because of the use of blood transfusion and arterial inflow via the tail artery. Thus a model using arterial inflow in the aorta and a miniaturized CPB circuit without need of transfusion was validated by examining intra-procedure characteristics, mortality and the effects of CPB on biomarkers of inflammation and cerebral injury during 5days follow-up.METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n=95) were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5%) and fentanyl/midazolam during CPB. Animals were assigned to Control (n=6), Sham (n=40) or normothermic CPB (n=49) groups. Both Sham and CPB were cannulated in the aorta via the left carotid artery and in the right common jugular vein for access into the right heart. Extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was instituted for 60min only in CPB at a flow rate of 120mLkg(-1)min(-1) employing a CPB circuit of 15ml primed with 6% hydroxyethyl starch 60mgml(-1) solution. Rats were sacrificed at either 1h or 1, 2 or 5days after Sham or weaning from CPB. Plasma IL-6 and s100Beta levels were measured and blood cell counts were performed.RESULTS: Mortality in CPB animals (3 out of 49) and Sham (4 out of 40) did not differ (chi-square=0.46, dF=1, P&gt;0.5). Compared to baseline (1.87±0.46∗10^9cells/L), Sham procedure (cannulation and anesthesia) significantly increased blood neutrophil count at the end of the period matching ECC (6.34±2.36∗10^9cells/L, P&lt;0.05). CPB induced neutrophilia which persisted during 24h recovery. Also, CPB caused a rapid and prominent increase in plasma IL-6 from the first hour of the postoperative period (~1200pg/ml) with continuation (50-90pg/ml) up to 5th day of recovery. S100Beta levels were above detection level only in 3 out of 42 samples from CPB animals.DISCUSSION: Our rat model of CPB without homologous blood transfusion produces a reproducible and reliable systemic inflammatory response, with low mortality rates on long term follow up. The model more closely mimics the human situation in respect to arterial inflow site and avoidance of blood transfusion. Thus, our CPB model is suitable to study its influence on systemic inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, microcirculation and vascular dysfunction in vivo, and to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Angiotensin II (AT-II) is a pro-fibrotic compound that acts via membrane-bound receptors (AT-1R/AT-2R) and thereby activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). AT-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are thus important candidates in the treatment of liver fibrosis. However, multiple case reports suggest that AT-1R blockers may induce hepatocyte injury. Therefore, we investigated the effect of AT-II and its receptor blockers on cytokine-, oxidative stress- and bile salt-induced cell death in hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to TNF-α/Actinomycin D, the ROS-generating agent menadione or the bile salts: glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and tauro-lithocholic acid-3 sulfate (TLCS), to induce apoptosis. AT-II (100 nmol/L) was added 10 minutes prior to the cell death-inducing agent. AT-1R antagonists (Sartans) and the AT-2R antagonist PD123319 were used at 1 µmol/L. Apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, acridine orange staining) and necrosis (Sytox green staining) were quantified. Expression of CHOP (marker for ER stress) and AT-II receptor mRNAs were quantified by Q-PCR. AT-II dose-dependently reduced GCDCA-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p&lt;0.05) without inducing necrosis. In addition, AT-II reduced TLCS-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p&lt;0.05). However, AT-II did not suppress TNF/Act-D and menadione-induced apoptosis. Only the AT-1R antagonists abolished the protective effect of AT-II against GCDCA-induced apoptosis. AT-II increased phosphorylation of ERK and a significant reversal of the protective effect of AT-II was observed when signaling kinases, including ERK, were inhibited. Moreover, AT-II prevented the GCDCA-induced expression of CHOP (the marker of the ER-mediated apoptosis).</AbstractText>: Angiotensin II (AT-II) is a pro-fibrotic compound that acts via membrane-bound receptors (AT-1R/AT-2R) and thereby activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).

Our results suggest a mechanism for the observed hepatocyte-toxicity of Sartans (angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs) in some patients with chronic liver injury.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Since the cerebrovasculature likely plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of eclampsia, we assessed the effects of low-dose endotoxin-induced experimental preeclampsia on the function and structure of rat posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) and mesenteric arteries (MA).METHODS: Nonpregnant (NP) and pregnant (P) rats were infused with saline (NP-CTL, n=9; P-CTL, n=9) or low-dose endotoxin (NP-endotoxin, n=9; P-endotoxin, n=10). Myogenic activity, pressure of forced dilatation (FD) and structural properties were evaluated in PCA and MA.RESULTS: PCA underwent FD between 125 and 150mmHg in P-endotoxin (repeated measures ANOVA vs 75mmHg; P&lt;0.05) and between 150 and 175mmHg in P-CTL and NP animals (repeated measures ANOVA vs 75mmHg; P&lt;0.05). PCA myogenic tone was unaffected by pregnancy or endotoxin, however, pregnancy decreased the MA myogenic tone (P&lt;0.05 vs NP). Passive characteristics of PCA and MA were unaffected by pregnancy or endotoxin.CONCLUSION: Low-dose endotoxin-infusion during pregnancy, but not pregnancy alone, decreased the pressure of FD in PCA. This may predispose to cerebral autoregulatory breakthrough and edema formation during increased blood pressure as seen in eclampsia.</p>

<p>Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease, and increased GDF15 levels have been associated with endothelial dysfunction in selected patients. We therefore investigated whether GDF15 modulates endothelial function in aortas of wild-type (WT) and GDF15 knockout (KO) mice. Vascular contractions to phenylephrine and relaxation to ACh were assessed in aortas obtained from healthy WT and GDF15 KO mice. The effects of GDF15 pretreatment and the involvement of ROS or caveolae were determined. Phenylephrine-induced contractions and ACh-mediated relaxations were similar in WT and GDF15 KO mice. Pretreatment with GDF15 inhibited contraction and relaxation in both groups. Inhibition of contraction by GDF15 was absent in denuded vessels or after blockade of nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Relaxation in WT mice was mediated mainly through NO and an unidentified endothelium-derived hyperpolarizin factor (EDHF), whereas GDF15 KO mice mainly used prostaglandins and EDHF. Pretreatment with GDF15 impaired relaxation in WT mice by decreasing NO; in GDF15 KO mice, this was mediated by decreased action of prostaglandins. Disruption of caveolae resulted in a similar inhibition of vascular responses as GDF15. ROS inhibition did not affect vascular function. In cultured endothelial cells, GDF15 pretreatment caused a dissociation between caveolin-1 and endothelial NO synthase. In conclusion, GDF15 impairs aortic contractile and relaxing function through an endothelium-dependent mechanism involving altered caveolar endothelial NO synthase signaling.</p>

<p>Mammalian hibernation consists of periods of low metabolism and body temperature (torpor), interspersed by euthermic arousal periods. The function of both the innate and adaptive immune system is suppressed during hibernation. In this study, we analyzed the humoral adaptive immune response to a T-cell independent (TI-2) and a T-cell dependent (TD) antigen. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels were immunized in summer or during hibernation with either a TI-2 or TD antigen on day 0 and day 14. Blood was drawn on day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Both types of antigens induced a significant rise in antibody titer in summer animals. Much to our surprise, however, only immunization with the TD antigen, and not with the TI-2 antigen induced a humoral response in hibernators. Flow cytometric analysis of CD4 (helper T-lymphocytes), CD8 (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes) and CD45RA (B-lymphocytes) in blood, spleen and lymph nodes ruled out massive apoptosis as explanation of the absent TI humoral response during hibernation. Rather, reduced TI-2 stimulation of B-lymphocytes, possibly due to lowered serum complement during torpor, may explain the reduced antibody production in response to a TI-2 antigen. These results demonstrate that hibernation diminishes the capacity to induce a TI-2 humoral immune response, while the capacity to induce a humoral response to a TD antigen is maintained.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are important target enzymes in glycemic control and renovascular protection. Here, we studied the effect of NWT-03, an egg protein hydrolysate with DPP4- and ACE-inhibitory activity, on renovascular damage in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Comparisons were made to rats treated with vildagliptin (VIL), included as a positive control for the effect of DPP4 inhibition.METHODS: ZDF rats received NWT-03 (1 g/kg/day) or VIL (3 mg/kg/day) from 10 to 25 weeks of age. Metabolic and renal functions were assessed; the kidney was removed for histological analysis of glomerulosclerosis and expression of pro-inflammatory/fibrotic markers (RT-PCR and Western blotting); and the aorta was removed for studies of endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR).FINDINGS: Hyperinsulinemic ZDF rats typically developed signs of type-2 diabetes and renovascular damage, as evidenced by albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and impaired EDR. Neither NWT-03 nor VIL improved metabolic parameters; for VIL, this was despite a 5-fold increase in glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 levels. NWT-03 and VIL both reduced renal interleukin (Il)-1β/Il-13 mRNA expression and glomerulosclerosis. However, only NWT-03 additionally decreased renal tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA and P22(phox) protein expression, reduced albuminuria, and restored aortic EDR. Indomethacin added to the organ bath instantly improved aortic EDR, indicating a role for cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived contractile prostanoids in opposing relaxation in ZDF rats. This indomethacin effect was reduced by NWT-03, but not by VIL, and coincided with decreased renal COX-1/2 protein expression.CONCLUSION AND INTERPRETATION: Long-term supplementation with the egg protein hydrolysate NWT-03 attenuated renovascular damage in this preclinical rat model of type 2 diabetes. A comparison to the DPP4-inhibitor VIL suggests that the effects of NWT-03 were related to both ACE- and DPP4-inhibitory properties. The development of protein hydrolysates with a multiple-targeting strategy may be of benefit to functional food formulations.</p>

<p>According to the “membrane sensor” hypothesis, the membrane’s physical properties and microdomain organization play an initiating role in the heat shock response. Clinical conditions such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases are all coupled with specific changes in the physical state and lipid composition of cellular membranes and characterized by altered heat shock protein levels in cells suggesting that these “membrane defects” can cause suboptimal hsp-gene expression. Such observations provide a new rationale for the introduction of novel, heat shock protein modulating drug candidates. Intercalating compounds can be used to alter membrane properties and by doing so normalize dysregulated expression of heat shock proteins, resulting in a beneficial therapeutic effect for reversing the pathological impact of disease. The membrane (and lipid) interacting hydroximic acid (HA) derivatives discussed in this review physiologically restore the heat shock protein stress response, creating a new class of “membrane-lipid therapy” pharmaceuticals. The diseases that HA derivatives potentially target are diverse and include, among others, insulin resistance and diabetes, neuropathy, atrial fibrillation, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. At a molecular level HA derivatives are broad spectrum, multi-target compounds as they fluidize yet stabilize membranes and remodel their lipid rafts while otherwise acting as PARP inhibitors. The HA derivatives have the potential to ameliorate disparate conditions, whether of acute or chronic nature. Many of these diseases presently are either untreatable or inadequately treated with currently available pharmaceuticals. Ultimately, the HA derivatives promise to play a major role in future pharmacotherapy.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is expected to affect approximately 30 million North Americans and Europeans by 2050. AF is a persistent disease, caused by progressive, often age-related, derailment of proteostasis resulting in structural remodeling of the atrial cardiomyocytes. It has been widely acknowledged that the progressive nature of the disease hampers the effective functional conversion to sinus rhythm in patients and explains the limited effect of current drug therapies. Therefore, research is directed at preventing new-onset AF by limiting the development of substrates underlying AF promotion. Upstream therapy refers to the use of drugs that modify the atrial substrate- or target-specific mechanisms of AF, with the ultimate aim to prevent the occurrence (primary prevention) and recurrence of the arrhythmia following (spontaneous) conversion and to prevent the progression of AF (secondary prevention). Recently, we observed that heat shock protein (HSP)-inducing drugs, such as geranylgeranylacetone, prevent derailment of proteostasis and remodeling of cardiomyocytes and thereby attenuate the AF substrate in cellular, Drosophila melanogaster, and animal experimental models. Also, correlative data from human studies were consistent with a protective role of HSPs in preventing the progression from paroxysmal AF to permanent AF and in the recurrence of AF. In this review, we discuss novel HSP-inducing compounds as emerging therapeutics for the primary and secondary prevention of AF.</p>

<p>During hibernation, small mammals alternate between periods of metabolic suppression and low body temperature (‘torpor’) and periods of full metabolic recovery with euthermic temperatures (‘arousal’). Previously, we demonstrated marked structural remodeling of the lung during torpor, which is rapidly reversed during arousal. We also found that cooling of hamster cells increased endogenous production of H(2)S through the enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS). H(2)S suppresses the immune response and increases deposition of collagen. Therefore, we examined inflammatory markers and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in relation to CBS expression and H(2)S levels in lungs of euthermic and hibernating Syrian hamsters. Lung remodeling during torpor was confirmed by a strong increase in both collagenous and non-collagenous hydroxyproline content. The number of leukocytes in lung was unchanged in any phase of hibernation, while adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and the inflammatory marker NF-κB (P65) were modestly upregulated in torpor. Gelatinase activity was decreased in lungs from torpid animals, indicating inhibition of the Zn(2+)-dependent MMP-2 and MMP-9. Moreover, expression of CBS and tissue levels of H(2)S were increased in torpor. All changes normalized during arousal. Inhibition of gelatinase activity in torpor is likely caused by quenching of Zn(2+) by the sulphide ion of H(2)S. In accord, inhibition of CBS normalized gelatinase activity in torpid animals. Conversely, NaHS decreased the gelatinase activity of euthermic animals, which was attenuated by excess Zn(2+). Similar results were obtained on the activity of the Zn(2+)-dependent angiotensin converting enzyme. Our data indicate that increased production of H(2)S through CBS in hamster lungs during torpor contributes to remodeling by inhibition of gelatinase activity and possibly by suppression of the inflammatory response. Although administration of H(2)S is known to induce metabolic suppression in non-hibernating mammals (‘suspended animation’), this is the first report implying endogenous H(2)S production in natural hibernation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Development of micro- or macroalbuminuria is associated with increased risk of cardiorenal complications, particularly in diabetes. For prevention of transition to micro- or macroalbuminuria, more accurate prediction markers on top of classical risk markers are needed. We studied a promising new marker, growth-differentiation factor (GDF)-15, to predict transition to increasing stage of albuminuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, we looked at the GDF-15 potential in nondiabetic subjects with hypertension (HT).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Case and control subjects were selected from the PREVEND cohort, a large (n = 8,592), prospective general population study on the natural course of albuminuria, with &gt;10 years of follow-up and repeated albuminuria measurements. We found 24 T2DM and 50 HT case subjects transitioning from normo- to macroalbuminuria and 9 T2DM and 25 HT case subjects transitioning from micro- to macroalbuminuria (average follow-up 2.8 years). Control subjects with stable albuminuria were pair matched for age, sex, albuminuria status, and diabetes duration. GDF-15 was measured in samples prior to albuminuria transition.RESULTS: Prior to transition, GDF-15 was significantly higher in case subjects with T2DM than in control subjects (median [IQR] 1,288 pg/mL [885-1,546] vs. 948 pg/mL [660-1,016], P &lt; 0.001). The odds ratio for transition in albuminuria increased significantly per SD of GDF-15 (2.9 [95% CI 1.1-7.5], P = 0.03). GDF-15 also improved prediction of albuminuria transition, with significant increases in C statistic (from 0.87 to 0.92, P = 0.03) and integrated discrimination improvement (0.148, P = 0.001). In HT, GDF-15 was also independently associated with transition in albuminuria stage (2.0 [1.1-3.5], P = 0.02) and improved prediction significantly.CONCLUSIONS: We identified GDF-15 as a clinically valuable marker for predicting transition in albuminuria stage in T2DM beyond conventional risk markers. These findings were confirmed in nondiabetic HT subjects.</p>

<p>Previously, it was shown that individuals with good baseline (a priori) endothelial function in isolated (in vitro) renal arteries developed less renal damage after 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx; Gschwend S, Buikema H, Navis G, Henning RH, de Zeeuw D, van Dokkum RP. J Am Soc Nephrol 13: 2909-2915, 2002). In this study, we investigated whether preexisting glomerular vascular integrity predicts subsequent renal damage after 5/6Nx, using in vivo intravital microscopy and in vitro myogenic constriction of small renal arteries. Moreover, we aimed to elucidate the role of renal ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression in this model. Anesthetized rats underwent intravital microscopy to visualize constriction to ANG II of glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles, with continuous measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and renal blood flow. Thereafter, 5/6Nx was performed, interlobar arteries were isolated from the extirpated kidney, and myogenic constriction was assessed in a perfused vessel setup. Blood pressure and proteinuria were assessed weekly for 12 wk, and focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) was determined at the end of study. Relative expression AT1R in the kidney cortex obtained at 5/6Nx was determined by PCR. Infusion of ANG II induced significant constriction of both afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles, which strongly positively correlated with proteinuria and FGS at 12 wk after 5/6Nx. Furthermore, in vitro measured myogenic constriction of small renal arteries negatively correlated with proteinuria 12 wk after 5/6Nx. Moreover, in vivo vascular reactivity negatively correlated with in vitro reactivity. Additionally, relative expression of AT1R positively correlated with responses of glomerular arterioles and with markers of renal damage. Both in vivo afferent and efferent responses to ANG II and in vitro myogenic constriction of small renal arteries in the healthy rat predict the severity of renal damage induced by 5/6Nx. This vascular responsiveness is highly dependent on AT1R expression. Intraorgan vascular integrity may provide a useful tool to guide the prevention and treatment of renal end-organ damage.</p>

<p>Tissue hypoxia may play an important role in the development of ischemic brain damage. In the present study we investigated in a rat model of transient focal brain ischemia the neuroprotective effects of increasing the blood oxygen transport capacity by applying a semifluorinated alkane (SFA)-containing emulsion together with normobaric hyperoxygenation (NBO). The spread of tissue hypoxia was studied using pimonidazole given prior to filament-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO, 2 h). Treatment consisted of intravenous injection of saline or the SFA-containing emulsion (0.5 or 1.0 ml/100g body weight; [SFA(0.5) or SFA(1.0)]) either upon establishing MCAO (early treatment) or after filament removal (delayed treatment). After injection NBO was administered for 8 h (early treatment) or 6 h (delayed treatment). Experiments were terminated 8 or 24 h after MCAO. In serial brain sections tissue hypoxia and irreversible cell damage were quantitatively determined. Furthermore, we studied hypoxia-related gene expression (VEGF, flt-1). Early treatment significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced the volumes of tissue damage (8 h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 57±34 mm³; controls, 217±70 mm³; 24 h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 189±82 mm³; controls, 317±60 mm³) and of P-Add immunoreactivity (8 h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 261±37 mm³; controls, 339±26 mm³; 24h after MCAO: SFA(1.0), 274±47 mm³; controls, 364±46 mm³). Delayed treatment was comparably successful. The volume of the hypoxic penumbra was not decreased by the treatment. Similarly, VEGF and flt-1 mRNA levels did not differ between the experimental groups. From these data we conclude that increasing the blood oxygen transport capacity in the plasma compartment provides a neuroprotective effect by alleviating the severity of hypoxia to a level sufficient to prevent cells from transition into irreversible damage.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common, sustained clinical tachyarrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. AF is a persistent condition with progressive structural remodeling of the atrial cardiomyocytes due to the AF itself, resulting in cellular changes commonly observed in aging and in other heart diseases. While rhythm control by electrocardioversion or drug treatment is the treatment of choice in symptomatic AF patients, its efficacy is still limited. Current research is directed at preventing first-onset AF by limiting the development of substrates underlying AF progression and resembles mechanism-based therapy. Upstream therapy refers to the use of non-ion channel anti-arrhythmic drugs that modify the atrial substrate- or target-specific mechanisms of AF, with the ultimate aim to prevent the occurrence (primary prevention) or recurrence of the arrhythmia following (spontaneous) conversion (secondary prevention). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones and comprise a large family of proteins involved in the protection against various forms of cellular stress. Their classical function is the conservation of proteostasis via prevention of toxic protein aggregation by binding to (partially) unfolded proteins. Our recent data reveal that HSPs prevent electrical, contractile, and structural remodeling of cardiomyocytes, thus attenuating the AF substrate in cellular, Drosophila melanogaster, and animal experimental models. Furthermore, studies in humans suggest a protective role for HSPs against the progression from paroxysmal AF to persistent AF and in recurrence of AF. In this review, we discuss upregulation of the heat shock response system as a novel target for upstream therapy to prevent derailment of proteostasis and consequently progression and recurrence of AF.</p>

<p>DDT₁ MF-2 hamster ductus deferens cells are resistant to hypothermia due to serotonin secretion from secretory vesicles and subsequent cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) mediated formation of H₂S. We investigated whether the mechanism promoting resistance to hypothermia may be translationally induced in cells vulnerable to cold storage. Thus, VMAT-1 (vesicular monoamino transferase) and TPH-1 (tryptophan hydroxylase) were co-transfected in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMAC) and kidney tissue to create a serotonin-vesicular phenotype (named VTSMAC and VTkidney, respectively). Effects on hypothermic damage were assessed. VTSMAC showed a vesicular phenotype and an 8-fold increase in serotonin content and 5-fold increase in its release upon cooling. Cooled VTSMAC produced up to 10 fold higher concentrations of H₂S, and were protected from hypothermia, as shown by a 50% reduction of caspase 3/7 activity and 4 times higher survival compared to SMAC. Hypothermic resistance was abolished by the inhibition of CBS activity or blockade of serotonin re-uptake. In VTkidney slices, expression of CBS was 3 fold increased in cold preserved kidney tissue, with two-fold increase in H₂S concentration. While cooling induced substantial damage to empty vector transfected kidney as shown by caspase 3/7 activity and loss of FABP1, VTkidney was fully protected and comparable to non-cooled control. Thus, transfection of VMAT-1 and TPH-1 induced vesicular storage of serotonin which is triggered release upon cooling and has protective effects against hypothermia. The vesicular serotonergic phenotype protects against hypothermic damage through re-uptake of serotonin inducing CBS mediated H₂S production both in cells and kidney slices.</p>

<p>AIMS: We identified carnosinase-1 (CN-1) as risk-factor for diabetic nephropathy (DN). Carnosine, the substrate for CN-1, supposedly is a protective factor regarding diabetic complications. In this study, we hypothesized that carnosine administration to diabetic rats might protect the kidneys from glomerular apoptosis and podocyte loss.METHODS: We examined the effect of oral L-carnosine administration (1g/kg BW per day) on apoptosis, podocyte loss, oxidative stress, AGEs and hexosamine pathway in kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats after 3 months of diabetes and treatment.RESULTS: Hyperglycemia significantly reduced endogenous kidney carnosine levels. In parallel, podocyte numbers significantly decreased (-21% compared to non-diabetics, p&lt;0.05), apoptotic glomerular cells numbers increased (32%, compared to non-diabetic, p&lt;0.05) and protein levels of bax and cytochrome c increased (175% and 117%). Carnosine treatment restored carnosine kidney levels, prevented podocytes loss (+23% compared to diabetic, p&lt;0.05), restrained glomerular apoptosis (-34% compared to diabetic; p&lt;0.05) and reduced expression of bax and cytochrome c (-63% and -54% compared to diabetics, both p&lt;0.05). In kidneys of all diabetic animals, levels of ROS, AGEs and GlcNAc-modified proteins were increased.CONCLUSION: By inhibition of pro-apoptotic signaling and independent of biochemical abnormalities, carnosine protects diabetic rat kidneys from apoptosis and podocyte loss.</p>

<p>Biogenic amines have been demonstrated to protect cells from apoptotic cell death. Herein we show for the first time that serotonin and dopamine increase H(2)S production by the endogenous enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and protect cells against hypothermia/rewarming induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and apoptosis. Treatment with both compounds doubled CBS expression through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and increased H(2)S production in cultured rat smooth muscle cells. In addition, serotonin and dopamine treatment significantly reduced ROS formation. The beneficial effect of both compounds was minimized by inhibition of their re-uptake and by pharmacological inhibition of CBS or its down-regulation by siRNA. Exogenous administration of H(2)S and activation of CBS by Prydoxal 5’-phosphate also protected cells from hypothermic damage. Finally, serotonin and dopamine pretreatment of rat lung, kidney, liver and heart prior to 24 h of hypothermia at 3°C followed by 30 min of rewarming at 37°C upregulated the expression of CBS, strongly reduced caspase activity and maintained the physiological pH compared to untreated tissues. Thus, dopamine and serotonin protect cells against hypothermia/rewarming induced damage by increasing H(2)S production mediated through CBS. Our data identify a novel molecular link between biogenic amines and the H(2)S pathway, which may profoundly affect our understanding of the biological effects of monoamine neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>The most common clinical tachycardia, Atrial Fibrillation (AF), is a progressive disease, caused by cardiomyocyte remodeling, which finally results in contractile dysfunction and AF persistence. Recently, we identified a protective role of heat shock proteins (HSPs), especially the small HSPB1 member, against tachycardia remodeling in experimental AF models. Our understanding of tachycardia remodeling and anti-remodeling drugs is currently hampered by the lack of suitable (genetic) manipulatable in vivo models for rapid screening of key targets in remodeling. We hypothesized that Drosophila melanogaster can be exploited to study tachycardia remodeling and protective effects of HSPs by drug treatments or by utilizing genetically manipulated small HSP-overexpressing strains. Tachypacing of Drosophila pupae resulted in gradual and significant cardiomyocyte remodeling, demonstrated by reduced contraction rate, increase in arrhythmic episodes and reduction in heart wall shortening, compared to normal paced pupae. Heat shock, or pre-treatment with HSP-inducers GGA and BGP-15, resulted in endogenous HSP overexpression and protection against tachycardia remodeling. DmHSP23 overexpressing Drosophilas were protected against tachycardia remodeling, in contrast to overexpression of other small HSPs (DmHSP27, DmHSP67Bc, DmCG4461, DmCG7409, and DmCG14207). (Ultra)structural evaluation of the tachypaced heart wall revealed loss of sarcomeres and mitochondrial damage which were absent in tachypaced DmHSP23 overexpressing Drosophila. In addition, tachypacing induced a significant increase in calpain activity, which was prevented in tachypaced Drosophila overexpressing DmHSP23. Tachypacing of Drosophila resulted in cardiomyocyte remodeling, which was prevented by general HSP-inducing treatments and overexpression of a single small HSP, DmHSP23. Thus, tachypaced D. melanogaster can be used as an in vivo model system for rapid identification of novel targets to combat AF associated cardiomyocyte remodeling.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated the small heat shock protein, HSPB1, to prevent tachycardia remodeling in in vitro and in vivo models for Atrial Fibrillation (AF). To gain insight into its mechanism of action, we examined the protective effect of all 10 members of the HSPB family on tachycardia remodeling. Furthermore, modulating effects of HSPB on RhoA GTPase activity and F-actin stress fiber formation were examined, as this pathway was found of prime importance in tachycardia remodeling events and the initiation of AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Tachypacing (4 Hz) of HL-1 atrial myocytes significantly and progressively reduced the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients (CaT). In addition to HSPB1, also overexpression of HSPB6, HSPB7 and HSPB8 protected against tachypacing-induced CaT reduction. The protective effect was independent of HSPB1. Moreover, tachypacing induced RhoA GTPase activity and caused F-actin stress fiber formation. The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 significantly prevented tachypacing-induced F-actin formation and CaT reductions, showing that RhoA activation is required for remodeling. Although all protective HSPB members prevented the formation of F-actin stress fibers, their mode of action differs. Whilst HSPB1, HSPB6 and HSPB7 acted via direct prevention of F-actin formation, HSPB8-protection was mediated via inhibition of RhoA GTPase activity.CONCLUSION: Overexpression of HSPB1, as well as HSPB6, HSPB7 and HSPB8 independently protect against tachycardia remodeling by attenuation of the RhoA GTPase pathway at different levels. The cardioprotective role for multiple HSPB members indicate a possible therapeutic benefit of compounds able to boost the expression of single or multiple members of the HSPB family.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme in the tryptophan catabolism, has recently emerged as an important immunosuppressive enzyme involved in the regulation of both physiologic (maternal tolerance), as well as pathologic (neoplasia, autoimmune diseases, asthma) processes. Accumulating evidence points to a role for IDO in suppressing T-cell responses, thereby promoting tolerance. In the present study, we investigate the effects of adenovirus-mediated gene therapy with IDO on the acute rejection of the transplanted kidneys.METHODS: The experiments were performed in a rat Fisher to Lewis acute renal rejection model. RGD modified adenovirus carrying IDO gene (RGD-AdTIDO, n = 9) or RGD modified adenovirus carrying green fluorescent protein gene (RGD-AdTL, n = 8) were injected into the renal artery of the donor kidney before transplantation. A group receiving saline (n = 8) served as control. Rats were sacrificed after 7 days.RESULTS: Successful gene delivery was confirmed with real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. RGD-AdTIDO significantly decreased elevated plasma creatinine (93.7 ± 18.9 µmol/l) compared to the RGD-AdTL (248.2 ± 43.6 µmol/l) and saline (228.3 ± 46.4 µmol/l) treated rats. Moreover, RGD-AdTIDO therapy diminished the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and macrophages into the graft and reduced renal interstitial pre-fibrosis. Also, it limited the up-regulation of kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17 and transforming growth factor-β mRNA expression, and increased foxp3 mRNA expression compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: RGD-AdTIDO therapy improves renal function and morphology in a clinically relevant model of acute rejection.</p>

<p>Mammalian hibernation consists of periods of depressed metabolism and reduced body temperature called “torpor” that are interspersed by normothermic arousal periods. Numerous cellular processes are halted during torpor, including transcription, translation, and ion homeostasis. Hibernators are able to survive long periods of low blood flow and body temperature followed by rewarming and reperfusion without overt signs of organ injury, which makes these animals excellent models for application of natural protective mechanisms to human medicine. This review examines efforts to induce torpor-like states in non-hibernating species using pharmacological compounds. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of natural and pharmacologically induced torpor will speed the development of new clinical approaches to treat a variety of trauma and stress states in humans.</p>

<p>During hibernation, small rodents such as hamsters cycle through phases of strongly suppressed metabolism with low body temperature (torpor) and full restoration of metabolism and body temperature (arousal). Remarkably, the repetitive stress of cooling-rewarming and hypoxia does not cause irreversible organ damage. To identify adaptive mechanisms protecting the lungs, we assessed histological changes as well as the expression and localization of proteins involved in tissue remodeling in lungs from Syrian hamsters at different phases of hibernation using immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. In torpor (early and late) phase, a reversible increased expression of smooth muscle actin, collagen, angiotensin converting enzyme and transforming growth factor-β was found, whereas expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and caveolin-1 was low. Importantly, all these alterations were restored during arousal. This study demonstrates substantial alterations in protein expression mainly in epithelial cells of lungs from hibernating Syrian hamsters. These structural changes of the bronchial airway structure are termed airway remodeling and often occur in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung fibrosis. Unraveling the molecular mechanism leading to reversal of airway remodeling by the end of torpor may identify possible therapeutic targets to reduce progression of this process in patients suffering from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung fibrosis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with hypertension, proteinuria, loss of myogenic constriction (MC) of mesenteric arteries and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under experimental conditions. Previous results showed that ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme activity) inhibitor therapy is effective in slowing down the progression of disease. Therefore, we wanted to study whether the inverse AT(1) (angiotensin II type 1) receptor agonist, losartan (LOS) was effective in preventing loss of MC in a rat model of CRF and whether acute ROS scavengers could improve MC.METHODS: Rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) and were treated with vehicle or LOS (20 mg/kg/day; 5/6 Nx + LOS) for 12 weeks. Thereafter, the MC of the mesenteric arteries were measured in the presence and/or absence of tempol and catalase. Systolic blood pressure and proteinuria were measured weekly.RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure and proteinuria in the 5/6 Nx + LOS group were significantly lower than in the 5/6 Nx group. Moreover, the MC of 5/6 Nx + LOS arteries was significantly increased compared with the untreated 5/6 Nx group (maximum MC, 32.3 ± 6.9 vs 8.9 ± 3.8% (p &lt; 0.01)). Tempol + catalase significantly increased the MC in the 5/6 Nx group, but not in the 5/6 Nx + LOS group (increase in MC, 59.7 ± 13.0 (p &lt; 0.05) vs. 17.0 ± 15.1%).CONCLUSION: These results support the roles of the RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) and ROS in the vascular dysfunction of systemic vessels in CRF.</p>

<p>Hibernation is an energy-conserving behavior consisting of periods of inhibited metabolism (‘torpor’) with lowered body temperature. Torpor bouts are interspersed by arousal periods, in which metabolism increases and body temperature returns to euthermia. In deep torpor, the body temperature typically decreases to 2-10 °C, and major physiological and immunological changes occur. One of these alterations constitutes an almost complete depletion of circulating lymphocytes that is reversed rapidly upon arousal. Here we show that torpor induces the storage of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs in response to a temperature-dependent drop in plasma levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Regulation of lymphocyte numbers was mediated through the type 1 S1P receptor (S1P(1)), because administration of a specific antagonist (W146) during torpor (in a Syrian hamster at ∼8 °C) precluded restoration of lymphocyte numbers upon subsequent arousal. Furthermore, S1P release from erythrocytes via ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporters was significantly inhibited at low body temperature (4 °C) but was restored upon rewarming. Reversible lymphopenia also was observed during daily torpor (in a Djungarian hamster at ± 25 °C), during forced hypothermia in anesthetized (summer-active) hamsters (at ± 9 °C), and in a nonhibernator (rat at ∼19 °C). Our results demonstrate that lymphopenia during hibernation in small mammals is driven by body temperature, via altered plasma S1P levels. S1P is recognized as an important bioactive lipid involved in regulating several other physiological processes as well and may be an important factor regulating additional physiological processes in hibernation as well as in mediating the effects of therapeutic hypothermia in patients.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High level of plasma catecholamines is a risk factor for vascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Catecholamines induce hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle through α(1) -adrenoceptors, which in cell culture involves the transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We hypothesized that EGFR transactivation was also involved in contractions of rat aorta mediated by α(1) -adrenoceptors.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Thoracic aorta was isolated from 12-14 week old male Wistar rats. In vitro aortic contractile responses to cumulative doses of phenylephrine were characterized in the absence and presence of the EGFR kinase inhibitors, AG1478 and DAPH, in intact and endothelium-denuded rings. Involvement of signal transduction pathways was investigated by using heparin and inhibitors of Src, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 was measured after short-term phenylephrine or EGF stimulation in aorta segments in the presence of AG1478 and the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin.KEY RESULTS: AG1478 and DAPH concentration dependently attenuated phenylephrine-induced contractile responses in intact or endothelium-denuded aortic rings. Inhibition of PI3K (wortmannin and LY294002) but not heparin or inhibitors of Src or MMP, prevented the effect of AG1478 on the responses to phenylephrine. Phenylephrine induced phosphorylation of EGFR, which was partially blocked by AG1478. Phenylephrine also increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, time-dependently and was blocked by AG1478 and wortmannin.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Contractions of rat thoracic aorta mediated by α(1) -adrenoceptors involved transactivation of EGFR, mediated via a PI3K and ERK1/2 dependent pathway.</p>

<p>Kidney transplantation remains the best therapeutic option for patients with end-stage renal disease. Immunosuppressive therapy has largely resolved the issue of acute transplant rejection. However, because of its systemic nature, immunosuppressive therapy trades off efficacy against side-effects and its chronic use has been associated with severe infections and malignancy. Moreover, long-term survival of renal grafts did not change over the past twenty years. This situation may be improved by using gene therapy as an alternative or add-on strategy to the classic, systemic immune suppression. This review discusses gene therapy approaches in kidney transplantation by addressing the essentials of delivery vectors and by outlining strategies to achieve local immunosupression and allograft-specific tolerance, both in acute rejection and chronic transplant dysfunction. Employing such strategies, local suppression of the immune response and induction of transplantation-specific tolerance have been accomplished in experimental gene therapy. If successful in the clinical setting, gene therapy may (partially) substitute systemic, non-selective immunosuppressive medication, with a major impact on the quality of life and survival of the transplanted patients as well as on the waiting time for receiving a renal graft.</p>

<p>Graft quality before transplantation is a major factor influencing chronic rejection. Organ preservation and ischemia/reperfusion play an important role in the induction of organ injury. Although both suppression of metabolism by hypothermic preservation and preconditioning before ischemia limit injury, understanding the biochemical signaling pathways will allow us to optimize graft preservation further. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important enzyme sensing cellular energy balance and regulating downstream signaling pathways, signaling toward an energy-conserving state. In this review, we summarize available literature regarding the protective signaling pathways activated by (hypothermic) ischemia and preconditioning and how they can be activated pharmacologically. Optimizing the graft quality before transplantation improves long-term graft survival. The major factor influencing organ quality is organ preservation, cold storage, currently, being a common practice. Loss of cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction are the major factors inducing injury after cold storage. Adenosine triphosphate depletion and anaerobic metabolism during the cold ischemic period lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, disturbed osmoregulation, and cell death inducing inflammation. Ischemic preconditioning consists of brief periods of ischemia preceding preservation and protects organs against injury because of subsequent ischemia/reperfusion, in which endothelial nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kB, and adenosine play a major role. After conversion of adenosine to AMP, AMPK can be activated, a central kinase involved in sensing cellular [AMP]:[adenosine triphosphate] levels and signaling toward an energy-conserving state. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK demonstrated its ability to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inhibit nuclear factor-kB, thereby limiting endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Further, studies in knock-out mice lacking ENTDP1 and NT5E (enzymes catalyzing formation and degradation of AMP, respectively) demonstrated a clear protective role for AMP in ischemia/reperfusion. AMPK activation before or during organ preservation might be a promising pharmacologic approach to limit organ injury and maintain graft quality before transplantation.</p>

<p>Progress testing in the Netherlands was originally developed at Maastricht University. Since the late 1990s, a collaboration has started between three medical schools to jointly produce and administer the progress test. Currently, the progress test is administered to five out of eight medical schools in the Netherlands. The collaboration has led to substantial decrease in necessary resources per participating school. Also, the data provide a rich source for comparisons between schools and can be instrumental in inducing improvements to the curricula. Logistics of large-scale administrations and possible differences of views on item quality could be seen as a disadvantage. Also, it is not always easy to fit the test in the local regulatory structure, because it is only partly owned by each individual school. Important lessons for us have been that the advantages of the collaboration clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Of course, good collegial communication is needed, but this is not enough: a legal binding agreement has to be drawn up. Most importantly, such a collaboration creates a critical mass to enable multi-centre research and development projects on progress testing.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The (CTG)(n) polymorphism in the serum carnosinase (CN-1) gene affects CN-1 secretion. Since CN-1 is heavily glycosylated and glycosylation might influence protein secretion as well, we tested the role of N-glycosylation for CN-1 secretion and enzyme activity. We also tested whether CN-1 secretion is changed under hyperglycemic conditions.RESULTS: N-glycosylation of CN-1 was either inhibited by tunicamycin in pCSII-CN-1-transfected Cos-7 cells or by stepwise deletion of its three putative N-glycosylation sites. CN-1 protein expression, N-glycosylation, and enzyme activity were assessed in cell extracts and supernatants. The influence of hyperglycemia on CN-1 enzyme activity in human serum was tested in homozygous (CTG)(5) diabetic patients and healthy control subjects. Tunicamycin completely inhibited CN-1 secretion. Deletion of all N-glycosylation sites was required to reduce CN-1 secretion efficiency. Enzyme activity was already diminished when two sites were deleted. In pCSII-CN-1-transfected Cos-7 cells cultured in medium containing 25 mmol/l d-glucose, the immature 61 kilodaltons (kDa) CN-1 immune reactive band was not detected. This was paralleled by an increased GlcNAc expression in cell lysates and CN-1 expression in the supernatants. Homozygous (CTG)(5) diabetic patients had significantly higher serum CN-1 activity compared with genotype-matched, healthy control subjects.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that apart from the (CTG)(n) polymorphism in the signal peptide of CN-1, N-glycosylation is essential for appropriate secretion and enzyme activity. Since hyperglycemia enhances CN-1 secretion and enzyme activity, our data suggest that poor blood glucose control in diabetic patients might result in an increased CN-1 secretion even in the presence of the (CTG)(5) allele.</p>

<p>Hibernation is a unique natural model to study large and specific modulation in numbers of leukocytes and thrombocytes, with potential relevance for medical application. Hibernating animals cycle through cold (torpor) and warm (arousal) phases. Previous research demonstrated clearance of leukocytes and thrombocytes from the circulation during torpor, but did not provide information regarding the timing during torpor or the subtype of leukocytes affected. To study the influence of torpor-bout duration on clearance of circulating cells, we measured blood cell dynamics in the European Ground Squirrel. Numbers of leukocytes and thrombocytes decreased within 24h of torpor by 90% and remained unchanged during the remainder of the torpor-bout. Differential counts demonstrated that granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes are all affected by torpor. Although a decreased production might explain the reduced number of thrombocytes, granulocytes and monocytes, this cannot explain the observed lymphopenia since lymphocytes have a much lower turnover rate than thrombocytes, granulocytes and monocytes. In conclusion, although underlying biochemical signaling pathways need to be unraveled, our data show that the leukocyte count drops dramatically after entrance into torpor and that euthermic cell counts are restored within 1.5h after onset of arousal, even before body temperature is fully normalized.</p>

<p>The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and its ligands are crucially involved in the renal response to ischaemia. We studied the heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), a major ligand for the EGF receptor, in experimental and human ischaemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). HB-EGF mRNA and protein expression was studied in rat kidneys and cultured human tubular (HK-2) cells that were subjected to IRI and in human donor kidneys during transplantation. The effect of EGF receptor inhibition was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, urinary HB-EGF protein excretion was studied after renal transplantation. Finally, HB-EGF KO and WT mice were subjected to IRI to study the role of HB-EGF in renal injury. HB-EGF mRNA was significantly up-regulated in the early phase of IRI in rats, cells, and human donor biopsies. Treatment with PKI-166 reduces macrophage accumulation and interstitial alpha-SMA in the early phase of IRI in rats. In vitro, PKI-166 causes a marked reduction in HB-EGF-induced cellular proliferation. Urinary HB-EGF is increased after transplantation compared with control urines from healthy subjects. HB-EGF KO mice subjected to IRI revealed significantly less morphological damage after IRI, compared with WT mice. We conclude that IRI results in early induction of HB-EGF mRNA and protein in vivo and in vitro. Absence of HB-EGF and inhibition of the EGF receptor in the early phase of IRI has protective effects, suggesting a modulating role for HB-EGF.</p>

<p>Caveolae are a subtype of cholesterol-enriched lipid microdomains/rafts that are routinely detected as vesicles pinching off from the plasma membrane. Caveolin-1 is an essential component of caveolae. Hepatic caveolin-1 plays an important role in liver regeneration and lipid metabolism. Expression of caveolin-1 in hepatocytes is relatively low, and it has been suggested to also reside at other subcellular locations than the plasma membrane. Recently, we found that the peroxisomal membrane contains lipid microdomains. Like caveolin-1, hepatic peroxisomes are involved in lipid metabolism. Here, we analyzed the subcellular location of caveolin-1 in rat hepatocytes. The subcellular location of rat hepatocyte caveolin-1 was analyzed by cell fractionation procedures, immunofluorescence, and immuno-electron microscopy. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged caveolin-1 was expressed in rat hepatocytes. Lipid rafts were characterized after Triton X-100 or Lubrol WX extraction of purified peroxisomes. Fenofibric acid-dependent regulation of caveolin-1 was analyzed. Peroxisome biogenesis was studied in rat hepatocytes after RNA interference-mediated silencing of caveolin-1 and caveolin-1 knockout mice. Cell fractionation and microscopic analyses reveal that caveolin-1 colocalizes with peroxisomal marker proteins (catalase, the 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70, the adrenoleukodystrophy protein ALDP, Pex14p, and the bile acid-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase BAAT) in rat hepatocytes.

<p>It is unknown whether generalized vascular dysfunction precedes the development of kidney disease. Therefore, we studied myogenic constriction and endothelium-mediated dilatory responses in two inbred Fawn-Hooded (FH) rat strains, one of which spontaneously develops hypertension, proteinuria, and glomerulosclerosis (FHH), whereas the other (FHL) does not. Small renal, mesenteric resistance arteries and thoracic aorta isolated from FH rats before (7 wk old) and after the development of mild proteinuria (12 wks old) were mounted in perfused and isometric set-ups, respectively. Myogenic response, endothelium-dependent relaxation, and the contribution of endothelium-mediated dilatory compounds were studied using their respective inhibitors. Myogenic reactivity was assessed constructing pressure-diameter curves in the presence and absence of calcium. At the age of 7 wk, renal arteries isolated from kidneys of FHH rats developed significantly lower myogenic tone compared with FHL, most likely because of excessive cyclo-oxygenase 1-mediated production of constrictive prostaglandins. Consequently, young FHH demonstrated reduced maximal myogenic tone (22 +/- 4.8 vs. 10.8 +/- 2.0%, P = 0.03) and the peak myogenic index (-6.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.8%/mmHg, P = 0.07 for FHL vs. FHH, respectively). Active myogenic curves obtained in mesenteric arteries isolated from 7-wk-old rats did not differ between either strain, demonstrating a similar level of systemic myogenic tone in FHL and FHH rats. Therefore, before any renal end-organ damage is present, myogenic response seems selectively impaired in renal vasculature of FHH rats. Aortic reactivity did not differ between FHL and FHH at the time points studied. The present study shows that vascular dysfunction in both small renal and systemic arteries precedes renal end-organ damage in a spontaneous model of hypertension-associated renal damage. These early vascular changes might be potentially involved in the increased susceptibility of FHH rats to renal injury.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic shock is associated with changes in vascular responsiveness that may lead to organ dysfunction and, ultimately, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Volatile anesthetics interfere with vasoresponsiveness, which may contribute to organ hypoperfusion. In this study, the authors examined the influence of adjunct nitrous oxide on the vascular responsiveness after short-term hemorrhagic shock under isoflurane anesthesia.METHODS: Spontaneously breathing mice (n = 31, 27.6 +/- 0.31 g) were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.4%) or with isoflurane (1.4%) and adjunct nitrous oxide (66%). Both groups were divided into Sham, Shock, and Resuscitated groups. Vascular reactivity to phenylephrine and acetylcholine and expression of cyclooxygenases were studied in the aorta.RESULTS: In the isoflurane-anesthetized groups, the contractile response to phenylephrine was increased in the Shock as compared with the Sham and Resuscitated groups (Emax = 3.2 +/- 0.4, 1.2 +/- 0.4, and 2.5 +/- 0.5 mN, respectively). Adjunct nitrous oxide increased phenylephrine contraction to a similar level in all three groups. In the Sham isoflurane group, acetylcholine caused a biphasic response: An initial relaxation followed by a contractile response sensitive to cyclooxygenases inhibition by indomethacine. The contractile response was abrogated in the isoflurane-anesthetized groups that underwent shock. In all groups, adjunct nitrous oxide preserved the contractile phase. Shock induced a down-regulation of cyclooxygenases-1, which was normalized by adjunct nitrous oxide.CONCLUSION: Adjunct nitrous oxide attenuates shock-induced changes in vascular reactivity and cyclooxygenases expression of mice under isoflurane anesthesia. This implies that vascular reactive properties during anesthesia in hemorrhagic shock conditions may be influenced by the choice of anesthetics.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Renal failure aggravates pathological cardiac remodelling induced by myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac remodelling is associated with telomere shortening, a marker for biological ageing. We investigated whether mild and severe renal failure shorten cardiac telomeres and excessively shorten telomeres after MI.METHODS: Rats were subjected to sham, unilateral (UNX) or 5/6th nephrectomy (5/6NX) to induce none, mild or severe renal failure. MI was induced by left coronary artery ligation. Renal function parameters and blood pressure were measured. DNA was isolated from non-infarcted cardiac tissue. Telomere length was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).RESULTS: Proteinuria was unchanged in UNX and MI compared with control, but strongly increased in 5/6NX, UNX+MI and 5/6NX+MI. Serum creatinine levels were increased fourfold in 5/6NX and tenfold in 5/6NX+MI. 5/6NX and groups with both renal failure and MI showed an approximate 20% reduction of telomere length, similar to the MI group. No excess telomere shortening was observed in hearts from rats with renal ablation after MI.CONCLUSION: Severe renal failure, but not mild renal failure, leads to shortening of cardiac telomeres to a similar extent as found after MI. Renal failure did not induce excessive telomere shortening after MI. (Neth Heart J 2009;17:190-4.).</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Proteinuria-associated endothelial dysfunction (ED) is assumed to play a main role in the cardiovascular morbidity in proteinuric patients. However, the connection between proteinuria and systemic endothelial function is not clear yet. Therefore, we studied aortic endothelial function in Munich Wistar Fromter (MWF) and fawn-hooded hypertensive (FHH) inbred rat strains with genetic proteinuria to determine the specific impact of proteinuria on the development of ED.METHODS: Proteinuria, cardiac function, systemic blood pressure, plasma lipid profiles, aortic endothelial function, plasma levels of cyclo-oxygenase products and dimethylarginines were investigated in 26-week-old inbred rat strains with (MWF and FHH) and without [Lewis (LEW) rats] proteinuric renal disease.RESULTS: The endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly reduced in MWF (p &lt; 0.05 vs. LEW or FHH). The plasma thromboxane B(2), prostaglandin F(2alpha) and prostaglandin E(2)levels were higher in MWF (p &lt; 0.05 vs. LEW or FHH), whereas the 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) level was comparable in all groups. The arginine/asymmetric dimethylarginine ratio was highest in MWF.CONCLUSIONS: This study differentiates common risk factors for ED in renal disease. Despite clear-cut proteinuria, FHH rats were devoid of changes in aortic endothelial function, indicating that some other deleterious factors must accompany proteinuria in order for ED to ensue. Further exploration of this model may serve to dissect mechanistical pathways and guide the development of protective strategies in the vascular damage of renal disease.</p>

<p>During normal pregnancy, in contrast to preeclampsia, plasma hemopexin activity is increased together with a decreased vascular angiotensin II receptor (AT(1)) expression. We now tested the hypothesis that hemopexin can downregulate the AT(1) receptor in vitro. Analysis of human monocytes or endothelial cells by flow cytometry showed decreased membrane density of AT(1) exclusively after incubation with active hemopexin, whereas in supernatants of these cell cultures, AT(1) molecules could be detected (dot blotting). Also, diminished AT(1) was observed in endothelial cell lysates after contact with hemopexin (Western blotting). Hemopexin also induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway inhibition in cells after stimulation with angiotensin II in vitro, indicating downregulation of AT(1) by hemopexin. In addition, functional loss of AT(1) occurred after incubation of rat aortic rings with active hemopexin, as reflected by decreased contraction of the aortic rings on stimulation with angiotensin II. It was further demonstrated that plasma from normal pregnant women decreased the AT(1) receptor expression on monocytes as compared with plasma from nonpregnant women or preeclamptic women. Finally, it was shown that plasma hemopexin activity increases during normal gestation from week 10 onward. We concluded that active hemopexin is able to downregulate the AT(1) receptor in human monocytes, endothelial cells, and rat aortic rings. We propose that the physiological role of enhanced hemopexin activity during healthy pregnancy is to downregulate the vascular AT(1) receptor, promoting an expanded vascular bed. Inhibition of hemopexin activity during preeclampsia may result in an enhanced AT(1) receptor expression and a contracted vascular bed.</p>

<p>The molecular understanding of diseases has been accelerated in recent years, producing many new potential therapeutic targets. A noninvasive delivery system that can target specific anatomical sites would be a great boost for many therapies, particularly those based on manipulation of gene expression. The use of microbubbles controlled by ultrasound as a method for delivery of drugs or genes to specific tissues is promising. It has been shown by our group and others that ultrasound increases cell membrane permeability and enhances uptake of drugs and genes. One of the important mechanisms is that microbubbles act to focus ultrasound energy by lowering the threshold for ultrasound bioeffects. Therefore, clear understanding of the bioeffects and mechanisms underlying the membrane permeability in the presence of microbubbles and ultrasound is of paramount importance.

<p>Vascular changes in diabetes are characterized by reduced vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. Previously, we demonstrated that TGF-beta1 impairs Ang II-induced contraction through reduced calcium mobilization. However, the effect of TGF-beta1 on Ang II-induced vascular remodeling is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of TGF-beta1 on Ang II-induced activation of the MAPK p44/42 pathway in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). Activation of MAPK p44/42 was determined with a phospho-specific antibody. Angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)) and AT(1) mRNA levels were measured by [(3)H]candesartan-binding and real-time PCR, respectively. AT(1) gene transcription activity was assessed using AT(1) promoter-reporter constructs and by a nuclear runoff assay. In TGF-beta1-pretreated cells, Ang II-induced phosphorylation of MAPK p44/42 was inhibited by 29 and 46% for p42 and p44, respectively, and AT(1) density was reduced by 31%. Furthermore, pretreatment with TGF-beta1 resulted in a 64% reduction in AT(1) mRNA levels and decreased AT(1) mRNA transcription rate by 42%. Pretreatment with TGF-beta1 blocked Ang II-induced proliferation of RASMC, while stimulating Ang II-induced upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 attenuates Ang II-mediated MAPK p44/42 kinase signaling in RASMC through downregulation of AT(1) levels, which is mainly caused by the inhibition of transcription of the AT(1) gene.</p>

<p>Contrast microbubbles in combination with ultrasound (US) are promising vehicles for local drug and gene delivery. However, the exact mechanisms behind intracellular delivery of therapeutic compounds remain to be resolved. We hypothesized that endocytosis and pore formation are involved during US and microbubble targeted delivery (UMTD) of therapeutic compounds. Therefore, primary endothelial cells were subjected to UMTD of fluorescent dextrans (4.4 to 500 kDa) using 1 MHz pulsed US with 0.22-MPa peak-negative pressure, during 30 seconds. Fluorescence microscopy showed homogeneous distribution of 4.4- and 70-kDa dextrans through the cytosol, and localization of 155- and 500-kDa dextrans in distinct vesicles after UMTD. After ATP depletion, reduced uptake of 4.4-kDa dextran and no uptake of 500-kDa dextran was observed after UMTD. Independently inhibiting clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, as well as macropinocytosis significantly decreased intracellular delivery of 4.4- to 500-kDa dextrans. Furthermore, 3D fluorescence microscopy demonstrated dextran vesicles (500 kDa) to colocalize with caveolin-1 and especially clathrin. Finally, after UMTD of dextran (500 kDa) into rat femoral artery endothelium in vivo, dextran molecules were again localized in vesicles that partially colocalized with caveolin-1 and clathrin. Together, these data indicated uptake of molecules via endocytosis after UMTD. In addition to triggering endocytosis, UMTD also evoked transient pore formation, as demonstrated by the influx of calcium ions and cellular release of preloaded dextrans after US and microbubble exposure. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that endocytosis is a key mechanism in UMTD besides transient pore formation, with the contribution of endocytosis being dependent on molecular size.</p>

<p>AIMS: We previously showed that enhanced myogenic constriction (MC) of peripheral resistance arteries involves active AT(1) receptors in chronic heart failure (CHF). Recent data suggest both transactivation of EGF receptors and caveolae-like microdomains to be implicated in the activity of AT(1) receptors. Thus, we assessed their roles in increased MC in mesenteric arteries of CHF rats.METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Wistar rats underwent myocardial infarction to induce CHF and were sacrificed after 12 weeks. The number of caveolae in smooth muscle cells (SMC) of mesenteric arteries of CHF rats was decreased by 43.6 +/- 4.0%, this was accompanied by increased MC, which was fully normalized to the level of sham by antagonists of the AT(1)-receptor (losartan) or EGF-receptor (AG1478). Acute disruption of caveolae in sham rats affected caveolae numbers and MC to a similar extent as CHF, however MC was only reversed by the antagonist of the EGF-receptor, but not by the AT(1)-receptor antagonist. Further, in sham rats, MC was increased by a sub-threshold concentration of angiotensin II and reversed by both AT(1)- as well as EGF-receptor inhibition. In contrast, increased MC by a sub-threshold concentration of EGF was only reversed by EGF receptor inhibition.CONCLUSION: These findings provide the first evidence that decreased SMC caveolae numbers are involved in enhanced MC in small mesenteric arteries, by affecting AT(1)- and EGF-receptor function. This suggests a novel mechanism involved in increased peripheral resistance in CHF.</p>

<p>Myocardial infarction (MI)-induced remodeling is associated with disturbed myocardial perfusion through vascular changes, such as reduced capillary density and endothelial dysfunction. Heart rate reduction (HRR) initiated immediately after MI stimulates angiogenesis and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction. We aimed to investigate the effects of long-term HRR on cardiac angiogenesis and endothelial function in a rat model of post-MI heart failure. Rats received early or late ivabradine or metoprolol for 12 or 9 weeks, respectively, and compared with untreated MI and sham animals 12 weeks after MI. Heart rate was measured in the conscious rat. MI resulted in an increased heart weight to body weight ratio, a decline in capillary density and a marked reduction in acetylcholine-induced relaxation. Early and late HRR by either ivabradine or metoprolol significantly increased capillary to myocyte ratio. Moreover, this ratio was significantly correlated to heart rate (r = -0.324 and P = 0.036). Neither early nor late chronic HRR prevented endothelial dysfunction, except a moderate improvement in late MI ivabradine group. In MI rats, HRR either by ivabradine or metoprolol treatment increases cardiac angiogenesis. Late HRR strategy was comparable to early HRR, suggesting that the beneficial effects are independent of the time of onset of therapy after MI.</p>

<p>Premature aging (senescence) of endothelial cells might play an important role in the development and progression of hypertension and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that bradykinin, a hormone that mediates vasoprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress-induced senescence. Bradykinin treatment (0.001 to 1 nmol/L) dose-dependently decreased senescence induced by 25 micromol/L of H(2)O(2) in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, as witnessed by a complete inhibition of increased senescent cell numbers and a 34% reduction of the levels of the senescence-associated cell cycle protein p21. Because H(2)O(2) induces senescence through superoxide-induced DNA damage, single-cell DNA damage was measured by comet assay. Bradykinin reduced DNA damage to control levels. The protective effect of bradykinin also resulted in a significant increase in the migration of H(2)O(2)-treated bovine aorta endothelial cells in an in vitro endothelial injury model, or “scratch” assay. The protective effect of bradykinin was abolished by the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140 and the NO production inhibitor N(omega)-methyl-L-arginine acetate salt. Therefore, we conclude that bradykinin protects endothelial cells from superoxide-induced senescence through bradykinin B2 receptor- and NO-mediated inhibition of DNA damage.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: To explore the hypothesis that stent placement decreases dilator function of various arteries outside the stented segment and that angiotensin- (1-7) improves this function, and to assess the contribution of dilator signal compounds. A further objective was to test the hypothesis that on-stent delivery of Ang-(1-7) reduces neointima formation and improves endothelial function.METHODS: Abdominal aortic stenting or sham operation was performed in the rat four weeks after stenting and treatment with intravenous saline or Ang-(1-7) infusion (24 mug/kg/h); vasomotor function in isolated thoracic aorta and brachial and iliac artery was measured in organ baths. Furthermore, Ang-(1-7)-eluting stents were designed and placed in rat abdominal aorta. Neointima formation and aortic function were tested after four weeks.RESULTS: Relaxation of the thoracic aorta to metacholine was decreased after stenting compared with shams due to a decrease in nitric oxide-mediated response (67% reduction in maximal NO-dependent response). Ang-(1-7) restored the response mainly through increased prostaglandin- and possibly also endothelial-derived hyperpolarising factor-mediated relaxation. Relaxation in the brachial artery decreased after stenting (maximal response dropped by 50%), whilst contractions to phenylephrine increased. Ang-(1-7) normalised vasomotor function. Iliac artery function remained unaltered after stenting but Ang-(1-7) increased maximal relaxations by 65%. Delivery of Ang-(1-7) by means of a drug-eluting stent improved endothelial function.CONCLUSION: Stenting differentially affects dilator and contractile function in various arterial beds. Ang-(1-7) both improves dilator function and normalises contractile function. Delivery of protective peptides such as Ang-(1-7) from the stent is a new therapy option that merits further development and exploration. (Neth Heart J 2008;16:293-8.).</p>

<p>The self-perpetuation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with atrial remodeling, including the degradation of the myofibril structure (myolysis). Myolysis is related to AF-induced activation of cysteine proteases and underlies loss of contractile function. In this study, we investigated which proteases are involved in the degradation of myofibrillar proteins during AF and whether their inhibition leads to preservation of contractile function after AF. In tachypaced HL-1 cardiomyocytes and atrial tissue from AF and control patients, degradation of myofibrillar proteins troponin (cTn) T, I, C, human cTnT and actin was investigated by Western blotting, and contractile function was analyzed by cell-shortening measurements. The role of major proteases was determined by applying specific inhibitors. Tachypacing of HL-1 cardiomyocytes induced a gradual and significant degradation of cTns but not actin, and caused contractile dysfunction. Both were prevented by inhibition of calpain but not by inhibition of caspases or the proteasome. In patients with persistent AF, a significant degradation of cTnT, cTnI and cTnC was found compared to sinus rhythm or paroxysmal AF, which correlated significantly with both calpain activity and the amount of myolysis. Additionally, by utilizing tachypaced human cTnT-transfected HL-1 cardiomyocytes, we directly showed that the degradation of human cTnT was mediated by calpain and not by caspases or proteasome. Our results suggest that calpain inhibition may therefore represent a key target in combating AF-related structural and functional remodeling.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to renal injury varies among individuals. Previously, we found that individual endothelial function of healthy renal arteries in vitro predicted severity of renal damage after 5/6 nephrectomy. Here we hypothesized that individual differences in endothelial function in vitro and renal perfusion in vivo predict the severity of renal damage in a model of adriamycin-induced nephropathy.METHODS: In three separate studies, the following baseline parameters were measured in healthy male Wistar rats: (1) acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation in small renal arteries in vitro (n = 16) and the contribution of prostaglandins, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) to the relaxation; (2) glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in spontaneously voiding rats in vivo (n = 16) and (3) the acute effect of the NO-synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, n = 12) on renal blood flow (RBF) as compared to vehicle infusion (n = 9). Following these measurements, adriamycin (1.75 mg/kg i.v.) was injected and subsequent renal damage after 6 weeks was related to the baseline parameters.RESULTS: Total ACh-induced (r = 0.51, P &lt; 0.05) and EDHF-mediated relaxation (r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.05), as well as ERPF (r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.01), positively correlated with the severity of proteinuria 6 weeks after injection. In contrast, pronounced baseline NO-mediated dilation was associated with lower proteinuria (r = 0.71, P &lt; 0.01). Nevertheless, an acute L-NAME infusion, strongly reducing RBF by 22 +/- 8%, during adriamycin administration provided protection against the development of proteinuria.CONCLUSIONS: Individual animals with pronounced baseline endothelial dilatory ability measured in vitro and high ERPF in vivo are vulnerable to renal damage after the adriamycin injection. Acute inhibition of NO during adriamycin administration, resulting in a decrease of RBF, protects against renal injury, probably by limiting the delivery of the drug to the kidney. Therefore, interindividual variability in renal haemodynamics might be crucially involved in susceptibility to nephrotoxic renal damage.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Recent observational studies show that reduced renal function is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Previously, we reported that myocardial infarction (MI) indeed enhanced mild renal function decline in rats after unilateral nephrectomy (NX) and that RAAS intervention inhibited this decline. The effects of an MI on pre-existing severe renal function loss and the effects of RAAS intervention interrupting this hypothesized cardiorenal interaction are however unknown and clinically even more relevant.METHODS: Male Wistar rats underwent MI, sham MI, 5/6NX, or 5/6NX and MI. Six weeks later, the NX rats were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or vehicle for 6 weeks.RESULTS: An MI did not significantly induce more proteinuria (303 +/- 46 versus 265 +/- 24 mg/24 h) and glomerulosclerosis (40 +/- 11 versus 28 +/- 4 arbitrary units) in 5/6NX+MI compared to 5/6NX, and ACEi therapy was equally effective in reducing renal damage in these groups. In the 5/6NX+MI group, decreased renal blood flow and creatinine clearance were observed compared to 5/6NX (2.2 +/- 0.6 versus 3.6 +/- 0.4 ml/min/kg and 2.1 +/- 0.3 versus 2.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min/kg), which both increased after ACEi to levels comparable found in the group that underwent 5/6NX alone.CONCLUSIONS: MI does not further deteriorate structural renal damage induced by 5/6NX compared with 5/6NX alone. Furthermore, renal haemodynamic impairment occurs after MI, which can be improved applying ACEi therapy. Therefore, we conclude that treatment with ACEi should be optimized in patients with chronic kidney disease after MI to improve renal function.</p>

<p>Discovery in the early 1990s of caveolin-1, the structural protein responsible for maintaining the ohm shape of caveolae, greatly enhanced investigations to elucidate the role of these little caves in the plasma membrane. Perhaps one of the most important realizations concerning caveolae and caveolin is that these elements play an important functional role in the modulation of cell signal transduction pathways, including those involved in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function. Their role was confirmed by studies with caveolin-1 knockout mice which lack caveolae and display abnormal endothelial function responses. One limitation of these knockout models, however, is that absence of the caveolin protein not only results in the lack of caveolae as a structure but also in the lack of interaction/modulation of enzymes/molecules (e.g. eNOS) to which caveolin binds (whether in- or outside caveolae). In contrast to caveolin knockout models, recent experimental findings suggest that in certain cardiovascular diseases caveolin may dissociate from caveolae to the cytosol, hence decreasing the number of caveolae without a change in the total amount of caveolin. Therefore, as the importance of defining the role of caveolins both in caveolae and in cellular regions is being highlighted, it seems also important at the same time to further define the role of caveolae per se being present in the plasma membrane as a structural entity. The objective of this review is to make an explorative tour on the role of caveolae in vascular endothelial function based on existing literature together with some preliminary experimental findings. Evidence and arguments are put forward that alterations in endothelial caveolae do occur in cardiovascular disease and may contribute to the observed endothelial dysfunction in these conditions.</p>

<p>Therapeutic modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is not complete without taking into consideration the beneficial effects of angiotensin-(1-7) in cardiovascular pathology. Various pharmacological pathways are already exploited to involve this heptapeptide in therapy as both inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers increase its levels. These drugs and administered angiotensin-(1-7) elicit various common effects, and some effects of the drugs are partially mediated by angiotensin-(1-7). The pharmacodynamic profile of angiotensin-(1-7) is rather complex, and in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated a wide palette of effects for angiotensin-(1-7), some of them potentially beneficial for cardiovascular disease. Using various animal models to study cardiovascular physiology and disease it was shown that angiotensin-(1-7) has antihypertensive, antihypertrophic, antifibrotic and antithrombotic properties, all properties that may prove beneficial in a clinical setting. We also observed a novel action of angiotensin-(1-7), namely its capacity to stimulate the proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells. Access of angiotensin-(1-7) to the clinic, however, is restricted due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties. In order to benefit of the therapeutic potential of angiotensin-(1-7) it is crucial to increase its half-life, either by using more stable analogues, which are now under development, or specific delivery methods. We here review the pharmacological characteristics and therapeutic potential of angiotensin-(1-7), implementing the experimental strategies taken to exploit the pharmacological mechanism of this heptapeptide in a clinical setting, and present our contribution to this field of research.</p>

<p>Kidney transplantation represents the therapy of choice for many patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the success of renal engraftment is hindered by a number of factors, the most important of which being adverse effects of systemic immunosuppressive therapy, chronic transplant dysfunction and a severe shortage of donor kidneys. Gene therapy approaches may provide valuable strategies in each of these areas. First, gene therapy holds the potential of local therapy, thus circumventing systemic side effects of chronic immunosuppression. Second, chronic transplant dysfunction may be addressed by innovative strategies to induce local immune tolerance, immune suppression and additional graft protecting mechanisms. Third, gene therapy may be instrumental in increasing the quality of the grafts by limiting ischemia-reperfusion injury, especially in non-heart beating donors, thereby expanding the donor pool. In this article, we give an overview of the current state of gene therapy in experimental models of kidney transplantation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is commonly perceived as a risk factor for decline in renal function, especially in patients with preoperative renal dysfunction. There are few data on the effects of CPB on renal function in patients with mild preoperative renal dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate renal function in patients with pre-existing mild renal dysfunction undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.METHODS: In a multicentre study cohort we measured prospectively the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by radioactive markers both before operation and on the 7th postoperative day in cardiac surgical patients with preoperative serum creatinine &gt;120 micromol l(-1) (n=56). In a subgroup of patients (n=14) in addition to the GFR, the effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and the filtration fraction (FF) were measured.RESULTS: While preoperative GFR [77.9 (25.5) ml min(-1)] increased to 84.4 (23.7) ml min(-1) (P=0.005) 1 week after surgery, ERPF did not change [295.8 (75.2) ml min(-1) and 295.9 (75.9) ml min(-1), respectively; P=0.8]. In accordance, the FF increased from 0.27 (0.05) (before operation) to 0.30 (0.04) (Day 7, P=0.01).CONCLUSION: Our results oppose the view that cardiac surgery with CPB adversely affects renal function in patients with preoperative mild renal dysfunction and an uncomplicated clinical course.</p>

<p>Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a leading cause of acute renal failure and a major determinant in the outcome of kidney transplantation. Here we explored systemic gene therapy with a modified adenovirus expressing Interleukin (IL)-13, a cytokine with strong anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. When ischemia was induced we found that the IL-13 receptor is expressed in both the normal and experimental kidneys. Prior to the induction of ischemia, rats received adenovirus-IL-13, control adenovirus or saline. IL-13 plasma levels increased more than 50-fold in adenovirus-IL-13 treated animals, confirming successful IL-13 gene delivery. Histological analysis showed decreased tubular epithelial cell damage with adenovirus-IL-13 therapy, accompanied by reduced kidney injury molecule-1 expression. Interstitial infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages was reduced by half as was interstitial fibrosis and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin. IL-13 treatment significantly diminished the expression of E-selectin, IL-8, MIP-2, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 mRNA. These results suggest that the use of systemic IL-13 gene therapy may be useful in reducing renal tubulointerstitial damage and inflammation caused by ischemia-reperfusion.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained clinical tachyarrhythmia. AF is a progressive condition as demonstrated by the finding that maintenance of normal rhythm and contractile function becomes more difficult the longer AF exists. AF causes cellular stress, which induces atrial remodelling, involving reduction in the expression of L-type Ca(2+) channels and structural changes (myolysis), finally resulting in contractile dysfunction. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) comprise a family of proteins involved in the protection against different forms of cellular stress. Their classical function is the prevention of toxic protein aggregation by binding to (partially) unfolded proteins. Recent investigations reveal that HSPs prevent atrial remodelling and attenuate the promotion of AF in both cellular and animal experimental models. Furthermore, studies in humans suggest a protective role for HSPs against progression from paroxysmal AF to chronic, persistent AF. Therefore, manipulation of the HSP system may offer novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention of atrial remodelling. Such approaches may contribute to the maintenance or restoration of tissue integrity and contractile function. Ultimately, this concept may offer an additional treatment strategy to delay progression towards chronic AF and/or improve the outcome of cardioversion.</p>

<p>Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an efficient vector for cardiac gene delivery. The relatively short transgene expression induced by SFV seems appropriate for angiogenic gene therapy. We tested the effects of SFV expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on cardiac angiogenesis and heart failure in the mRen2 transgenic rat.Six-week-old mRen2 rats received SFV-VEGF or control virus (n=7 each) administered intracoronarily. Twelve days after transfection, cardiac capillary density and function were assessed. Capillary density in cardiac regions where SFV expression was highest had decreased by 20% in the SFV-VEGF-treated group. The decrease in capillary density was accompanied by impaired systolic function as illustrated by increased endsystolic volumes and a 34% decrease in cardiac output.We conclude that the time frame of SFV expression is sufficient to induce structural alterations, but that VEGF in mRen2 transgenic rats did not elicit the expected angiogenic effect. Rather, capillary density was decreased and subsequently cardiac function was impaired. This paradoxical finding is possibly related to the pathophysiology associated with this model and warrants caution if one is to pursue VEGF-mediated, angiogenic therapy before proceeding to a clinical setting.

<p>Ultrasound and microbubbles targeted gene delivery (UMTGD) is a promising technique for local gene delivery. As the endothelium is a primary target for systemic UMTGD, this study aimed at establishing the optimal parameters of UMTGD to primary endothelial cells. For this, an in vitro ultrasound (US) setup was employed in which individual UMTGD parameters were systematically optimized. The criteria for the final optimized protocol were: (1) relative high reporter gene expression levels, restricted to the US exposed area and (2) induction of not more than 5% cell death. US frequency and timing of medium replacement had a strong effect on UMTGD efficiency. Furthermore, US intensity, DNA concentration and total duration of US all affected UMTGD efficiency. Optimal targeted gene delivery to primary endothelial cells can be accomplished with Sonovue microbubbles, using 20 microg/ml plasmid DNA, a 1 MHz US exposure of Ispta 0.10 W/cm(2) for 30 s with immediate medium change after UMTGD. This optimized protocol resulted in both an increase in the number of transfected cells (more than three fold) and increased levels of transgene expression per cell (170%).</p>

<p>Proteinuria plays a pathogenic role in the development of end stage renal disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower proteinuria and are renoprotective. However, large inter-individual variation in antiproteinuric response to ACE inhibitors exists. In this study, we explored the mechanism of therapeutic resistance to an ACE inhibitor in the rat 5/6 nephrectomy model. At week 6 after 5/6 nephrectomy, treatment with lisinopril was initiated for 6 weeks. Proteinuria and blood pressure were evaluated weekly. At the end of the experiment, rats were divided into tertiles according to their antiproteinuric response: (1) responders (n=9), (2) intermediate responders (n=8) and (3) non-responders to ACE inhibitor therapy (n=9). At the start of treatment, proteinuria had progressively increased to 154 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 123-185) mg/24 h in the entire cohort, with comparable proteinuria and blood pressure in all groups. Following treatment with ACE inhibitor, proteinuria was significantly lower in the responders (68, CI: 46-89 mg/24 h) compared to the non-responders (251, CI: 83-420) mg/24 h). Similarly, blood pressure was reduced in the responders, but unaffected in the non-responders. At autopsy, renal ACE activity and renal ACE expression were significantly lower in the responders compared to the non-responders. Although lisinopril intake was comparable in all animals, urinary drug excretion was increased in the non-responders, demonstrating increased drug clearance. Average urinary lisinopril excretion was correlated with antiproteinuric response (R(2)=0.32, P=0.003). In conclusion, both pharmacodynamic and -kinetic factors account for the non-response to lisinopril. Whether these can be overcome simply by increasing drug dosage in non-responders should be investigated.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is possible by virtue of systemic immunosuppression, which is in turn accompanied by serious side effects. The search for novel therapeutic agents and strategies is ongoing. Here we investigate the effects of adenovirus-mediated gene therapy with interleukin (IL)-13, which is a cytokine with strong immunomodulatory properties, on acute renal allograft injury. In addition, we compare the effects of local (intrarenal) and systemic (intramuscular) IL-13 gene therapy in kidney transplantation.METHODS: The experiments were performed in a rat Fisher to Lewis acute rejection model of kidney transplantation. An adenovirus-IL-13 or adenovirus-luciferase was injected either into the donor kidney before transplantation (local treatment) or into the hind leg muscle of recipient rats (systemic treatment). A group with no treatment served as control. No additional immunosuppressive therapy was applied. The rats were sacrificed after 8 days and inflammatory markers and renal pre-fibrosis were assessed.RESULTS: Efficient gene transfer was confirmed by ELISA, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. IL-13 gene therapy diminished graft infiltration with macrophages and cytotoxic T cells and limited up-regulation of mRNA levels of the adhesion molecule E-selectin and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Moreover, reduced renal interstitial pre-fibrosis was found in the rats receiving IL-13 gene therapy. The effects of local and systemic therapy were similar.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that IL-13 gene therapy in the graft significantly attenuates acute renal allograft damage, suggesting local therapy with IL-13 as a strategy to reduce the need for systemic immunosuppressive medication and thereby its side effects.</p>

<p>In this mini-review, the role of heat shock proteins in susceptability to induction of atrial fibrillation (AF) or in the process of AF is discussed. AF is the most common arrhythmia in humans, is self-perpetuating in nature and hence tends to become more persistent in time. Some studies show a correlation between high Hsp70 (HspA1A) expression in cardiac tissue and a reduced susceptability to induction of postoperative AF. Expression of Hsp70, Hsc70 (HspA8), Hsp40 (DnaJB1), Hsp60 (HspD1), Hsp90 (HspC1) was not associated with progression of AF. However, both correlative studies in human and experimental studies suggest that Hsp27 (HspB1) may delay progression of AF to the more permanent forms and hence Hsp27 might be referred to as a “Beat shock protein”.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Vasopressin, mainly through the V1a-receptor, is thought to be a major player in the maintenance of hyperfiltration. Its inhibition could therefore lead to a decrease in progression of chronic renal failure. To this end, the effect of the vasopressin V1a-receptor-selective antagonist, YM218, was studied on proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis in early and late intervention after 5/6 nephrectomy in rats, and compared with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I).MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 5/6 nephrectomy, early intervention was performed between week 2 and 10 thereafter with the V1a-receptor-selective antagonist (VRA, 10 mg/kg/day, n=10), enalapril (ACE-I, 10 mg/kg/day, n=9), or vehicle (n=8). Late intervention was performed in another group between week 6 and 12 with VRA (10 mg/kg/day, n=7), lisinopril (ACE-I, 5 mg/kg/day, n=7), or vehicle (n=7).RESULTS: In early intervention, proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis were significantly decreased by VRA compared to vehicle (44+7% and 59+8% respectively). ACE-I significantly decreased proteinuria (67+7%) and a trend towards a decrease in focal glomerulosclerosis was observed (30+18%). In late intervention, VRA did not decrease proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis compared to vehicle (21+20% and 0%, respectively), ACE-I significantly lowered proteinuria (92+2%) and a focal glomerulosclerosis (69+1%) lowering trend was observed.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that VRA may protect against early progression of renal injury after 5/6 nephrectomy, whereas its effectiveness seems limited in established renal damage.</p>

<p>Caveolae represent an important structural element involved in endothelial signal-transduction. The present study was designed to investigate the role of caveolae in endothelium-dependent relaxation of different vascular beds. Caveolae were disrupted by cholesterol depletion with filipin (4x10(-6) g L(-1)) or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD; 1x10(-3) mol L(-1)) and the effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation was studied in rat aorta, small renal arteries and mesenteric arteries in the absence and presence of L-NMMA. The contribution of NO and EDHF, respectively, to total relaxation in response to acetylcholine (ACh) gradually changed from aorta (71.2+/-6.1% and 28.8+/-6.1%), to renal arteries (48.6+/-6.4% and 51.4+/-6.4%) and to mesenteric arteries (9.1+/-4.0% and 90.9+/-4.1%). Electron microscopy confirmed filipin to decrease the number of endothelial caveolae in all vessels studied. Incubation with filipin inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by cumulative doses of ACh (3x10(-9)-10(-4) mol L(-1)) in all three vascular beds. In aorta, treatment with either filipin or MCD only inhibited the NO component, whereas in renal artery both NO and EDHF formation were affected. In contrast, in mesenteric arteries, filipin treatment only reduced EDHF formation. Disruption of endothelial caveolae is associated with the impairment of both NO and EDHF in acetylcholine-induced relaxation.</p>

<p>There is evidence suggesting that heat shock proteins (HSPs) may protect against clinical atrial fibrillation (AF). We evaluated the effect of HSP induction in an in vitro atrial cell line (HL-1) model of tachycardia remodeling and in tachypaced isolated canine atrial cardiomyocytes. We also evaluated the effect of HSP induction on in vivo AF promotion by atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling in dogs. Tachypacing (3 Hz) significantly and progressively reduced Ca(2+) transients and cell shortening of HL-1 myocytes over 4 hours. These reductions were prevented by HSP-inducing pretreatments: mild heat shock, geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), and transfection with human HSP27 or the phosphorylation-mimicking HSP27-DDD. However, treatment with HSP70 or the phosphorylation-deficient mutant HSP27-AAA failed to alter tachycardia-induced Ca(2+) transient and cell-shortening reductions, and downregulation (short interfering RNA) of HSP27 prevented GGA-mediated protection. Tachypacing (3 Hz) for 24 hours in vitro significantly reduced L-type Ca(2+) current and action potential duration in canine atrial cardiomyocytes; these effects were prevented when tachypacing was performed in cells exposed to GGA. In vivo treatment with GGA increased HSP expression and suppressed refractoriness abbreviation and AF promotion in dogs subjected to 1-week atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling. In conclusion, our findings indicate that (1) HSP induction protects against atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling, (2) the protective effect in HL-1 myocytes requires HSP27 induction and phosphorylation, and (3) the orally administered HSP inducer GGA protects against AF in a clinically relevant animal model. These findings advance our understanding of the biochemical determinants of AF and suggest the possibility that HSP induction may be an interesting novel approach to preventing clinical AF.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with altered systemic arterial tone and hypertension. Myogenic constriction and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-dependent relaxation represent major vasoregulatory mechanisms in small systemic arteries. Elevated myogenic response and impaired EDHF might participate in the development of essential hypertension; however, their role in CRF-related hypertension is unknown. We investigated whether myogenic response and EDHF are altered in subtotally nephrectomized (sNX) rats and whether these changes are modifiable by chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.METHODS: In a pressure arteriograph, myogenic constriction and EDHF-mediated relaxation were evaluated in small mesenteric arteries isolated from male Wistar rats 15 weeks after either sham operation (n = 7) (SHAM), sNX (n = 12) or sNX followed by 9 weeks of treatment with lisinopril (sNX + LIS, 2.5 mg/kg, n = 13).RESULTS: Surprisingly, myogenic response was reduced in hypertensive CRF rats (maximal myogenic tone: 37 +/- 2 and 18 +/- 4%, P &lt; 0.01; peak myogenic index: -0.80 +/- 0.08 and -0.40 +/- 0.12%/mmHg, P &lt; 0.05 in SHAM and sNX respectively). At the same time EDHF-mediated relaxation was also impaired (maximal response: 92 +/- 2 and 77 +/- 5%, P &lt; 0.01; pD2: 6.5 +/- 0.1 and 5.9 +/- 0.1, P &lt; 0.05). Both myogenic response and EDHF were inversely related to the severity of renal failure and restored by treatment with lisinopril to levels found in SHAM animals.CONCLUSION: Major constrictive (myogenic) and dilatory (EDHF) mechanisms of small systemic arteries are impaired in hypertensive CRF rats. These alterations do not seem to participate in the development of hypertension, being rather directly related to the severity of renal impairment. Both systemic vascular changes might be restored by renoprotective treatment with ACE inhibitor.</p>

<p>Recently, it was shown that myocardial infarction aggravates preexistent mild renal damage that is elicited by unilateral nephrectomy in rats. The mechanism behind this cardiorenal interaction likely involves the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and/or vasoactive peptides that are metabolized by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The renoprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) as well as combined ACE/NEP inhibition with a vasopeptidase inhibitor (VPI) was investigated in the same model to clarify the underlying mechanism. At week 17 after sequential induction of unilateral nephrectomy and myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril (ACEi), AVE7688 (VPI), or vehicle was initiated for 6 wk. Proteinuria and systolic BP (SBP) were evaluated weekly. Renal damage was assessed primarily by proteinuria, interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) staining, and the incidence of focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS). At start of treatment, proteinuria had increased progressively to 167 +/- 20 mg/d in the entire cohort (n = 42). Both ACEi and VPI provided a similar reduction in proteinuria, alpha-SMA, and FGS compared with vehicle at week 23 (proteinuria 76 +/- 6 versus 77 +/- 4%; alpha-SMA 60 +/- 6 versus 77 +/- 3%; FGS 52 +/- 14 versus 61 +/- 10%). Similar reductions in systolic BP were observed in both ACEi- and VPI-treated groups (33 +/- 3 and 37 +/- 2%, respectively). Compared with ACEi, VPI-treated rats displayed a significantly larger reduction of plasma (41 +/- 5 versus 61 +/- 4%) and renal (53 +/- 6 versus 74 +/- 4%) ACE activity. It is concluded that both ACEi and VPI intervention prevent renal damage in a rat model of cardiorenal interaction. VPI treatment seemed to provide no additional renoprotection compared with sole ACEi after 6 wk of treatment in this model, despite a more pronounced ACE-inhibiting effect of VPI.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin(1-7) is an active component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Its exact role in renal vascular function is unclear. We therefore studied the effects of angiotensin(1-7) on the renal vasculature in vitro and in vivo.METHODS: Isolated small renal arteries were studied in an arteriograph system by constructing concentration-response curves to angiotensin II, without and with angiotensin(1-7). In isolated perfused kidneys, the response of angiotensin II on renal vascular resistance was measured without and with angiotensin(1-7). The influence of angiotensin(1-7) on angiotensin II-induced glomerular afferent and efferent constriction was assessed with intravital microscopy in vivo under anaesthesia. In freely moving rats, we studied the effect of angiotensin(1-7) on angiotensin II-induced reduction of renal blood flow with an electromagnetic flow probe.RESULTS: Angiotensin(1-7) alone had no effect on the renal vasculature in any of the experiments. In vitro, angiotensin(1-7) antagonized angiotensin-II-induced constriction of isolated renal arteries (9.71 +/- 1.21 and 3.20 +/- 0.57%, for control and angiotensin(1-7) pre-treated arteries, respectively; P &lt; 0.0005). In isolated perfused kidneys, angiotensin(1-7) reduced the angiotensin II response (100 +/- 16.6 versus 72.6 +/- 15.6%, P &lt; 0.05) and shifted the angiotensin II dose-response curve rightward (pEC50, 6.69 +/- 0.19 and 6.26 +/- 0.12 for control and angiotensin(1-7) pre-treated kidneys, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Angiotensin(1-7), however, was devoid of effects on angiotensin-II-induced constriction of glomerular afferent and efferent arterioles and on angiotensin-II-induced renal blood flow reduction in freely moving rats in vivo.CONCLUSION: Angiotensin(1-7) antagonizes angiotensin II in renal vessels in vitro, but does not appear to have a major function in normal physiological regulation of renal vascular function in vivo.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes myocyte stress by inducing structural changes, predominantly myolysis, which is related to the progression of AF. As heat shock proteins (Hsp) protect against cellular stress, their efficacy in preventing myolysis was investigated in a tachy-paced cell model for AF and in patients with AF. HL-1 atrial myocytes were subjected to tachy-pacing, which induced myolysis. Hsp overexpression was accomplished by a mild heat shock or by the drug geranylgeranylacetone (GGA). Hsp-gene-transfection studies were carried out to investigate roles of individual Hsp. In left and/or right atrial appendages from patients with paroxysmal (n=14), persistent (n=17) AF and controls (n=13) in sinus rhythm (SR), Hsp levels (Westerns) and localization (confocal microscopy) were determined. Heat shock and GGA administered prior to tachy-pacing resulted in almost complete protection against tachy-pacing-induced myolysis. Overexpression of Hsp27, but not of Hsp70, also provided complete protection against pacing-induced myolysis. In patients with paroxysmal AF, Hsp27 expression was significantly increased compared to SR and persistent AF. No changes in Hsp40, Hsc70, Hsp70 and Hsp90 expression levels were observed. Hsp27 levels correlated inversely with the duration of paroxysmal and persistent AF and the extent of myolysis. Furthermore, Hsp27 was localized on myofibrils in tachy-paced HL-1 myocytes and in human cardiomyocytes. These data demonstrate that upregulation of Hsp, especially Hsp27, protects tachy-paced atrial myocytes from myolysis. Therefore, the observed elevated Hsp27 expression in patients with paroxysmal AF might serve to protect myocytes from myolysis and limit the progression to persistent AF. Pharmacological induction of Hsp, with drugs such as GGA, may represent a novel therapeutic approach in AF.</p>

<p>Endothelial dysfunction (ED) seems to be a crucial mediator of increased cardiovascular risk observed among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Importantly, systemic ED does not only occur in patients with severe renal failure, but also in individuals with earlier stages of CKD. Close association between microalbuminuria and systemic ED renders renal vascular function an important marker for the severity of cardiovascular damage. Furthermore, changes in renal endothelium might be actively involved in the progression of renal end-organ damage. Recently, experimental evidence showed that interindividual variability in endothelial function of healthy rats predicts susceptibility to renal damage and the efficacy of renoprotective treatment. Therefore, a specific manipulation of renal and systemic ED might provide benefits in various stages of CKD. ED thus may represent an ideal therapeutic target not only for treatment, but also for primary prevention of renal disease.</p>

<p>Rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) develop increased myogenic constriction in mesenteric resistance arteries. Here we investigated increased myogenic constriction in relation to alterations in EDHF- and NO-mediated dilatation in CHF-rats. Male Spraque-Dawley rats were subjected to myocardial-infarction or sham-surgery. At 9-10 weeks after surgery, isolated mesenteric artery ring preparations were studied in a wire-myograph. Stretch-induced myogenic constriction was obtained by stepwise increase of the internal circumference diameter (0.5-1.2 L100). Cyclooxygenase- and eNOS-inhibitors were employed to study NO- and EDHF-mediated dilatation in response to acetylcholine. Rats with CHF (n=8), but not sham-rats (n=6), developed significant myogenic constriction. In addition, the contribution of endothelial dilator mediators was significantly altered in CHF-rats, with increased dependency on NO and decreased EDHF-mediated dilatation. Moreover, EDHF-mediated dilatation was inversely correlated with myogenic constriction in individual CHF-rats (r=-0.74, p=0.04). These data demonstrate increased myogenic constriction in mesenteric arteries of rats with CHF post-MI to be correlated to decreased EDHF-mediated dilatation. These findings extend the previous observation that myogenic constriction antagonizes EDHF-mediated dilatation in rat coronary artery under normal conditions, and suggests this relationship also to become functional in mesenteric arteries under pathophysiological conditions of CHF.</p>

<p>Excretion of albumin in the urine is highly variable, ranging from nondetectable quantities to milligrams of albumin and even grams of albumin. Microalbuminuria is defined as low levels of urinary albumin excretion of 30 to 300 mg/d. Microalbuminuria is highly prevalent; in hypertensive and diabetic populations, its prevalence varies from 10 to 40%. It is interesting that microalbuminuria also is found frequently in seemingly healthy individuals (5 to 7%). The variable excretion of albumin in the urine is related to the risk for the individual to develop cardiovascular (CV) disease: Absence or very low levels of albuminuria is associated with low CV risk, whereas the CV risk increases markedly with increasing amount of albumin in the urine (even within the now considered normal range). The predictive power of urinary albumin levels for CV risk is independent of other CV risk factors and not only is present in individual with diabetes and/or hypertension but also in healthy individuals. Treatments that lower albuminuria are associated with CV protection, as demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials of patients with diabetes as well as in patients with hypertension. There is preliminary evidence that albuminuria lowering is CV protective in healthy individuals with an elevated albumin excretion rate. Differences between individuals in their level of albumin excretion are already observed at a very early age (just after birth). In fact, the interindividual variability seems to be relatively constant in the first 5 decades of life, indicating that microalbuminuria is not necessarily a consequence of vascular damage at later age. Higher levels of urinary albumin seem to reflect the ordinary interindividual variability in (renal and systemic) endothelial function. Experimental data show that between strains and even within strains, rats at young age show a remarkable difference in individual endothelial function, and this is strongly related to the susceptibility of that rat to organ damage. In conclusion, albuminuria seems to be a sensitive marker very early in life for the susceptibility of an individual to CV disease. It therefore may be an ideal target for early primary prevention using CV-protective therapy regimens.</p>

<p>During renal injury, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in proximal tubular cells plays an important role in the inflammatory events that eventually lead to renal fibrosis. We hypothesized that local inhibition of p38 within these cells may be an interesting approach for the treatment of renal fibrosis. To effectuate this, we developed a renal-specific conjugate of the p38 inhibitor SB202190 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole] and the carrier lysozyme. First, we demonstrated that SB202190 inhibited the expression of albumin-induced proinflammatory (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced profibrotic (procollagen-Ialpha1) genes over 50% in renal tubular cells (normal rat kidney-52E). Next, we conjugated SB202190 via a carbamate linkage to lysozyme. However, this conjugate rapidly released the drug upon incubation in serum. Therefore, we applied a new platinum(II)-based linker approach, the so-called universal linkage system (ULS), which forms a coordinative bond with SB202190. The SB202190-ULS-lysozyme remained stable in serum but released the drug in kidney homogenates. SB202190-ULS-lysozyme accumulated efficiently in renal tubular cells and provided a local drug reservoir during a period of 3 days after a single intravenous injection. Treatment with SB202190-ULS-lysozyme inhibited TGF-beta1-induced gene expression for procollagen-Ialpha1 by 64% in HK-2 cells. Lastly, we evaluated the efficacy of a single dose of the conjugate in the unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion rat model. A reduction of intrarenal p38 phosphorylation and alpha-smooth muscle actin protein expression was observed 4 days after the ischemia-reperfusion injury. In conclusion, we have developed a novel strategy for local delivery of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, which may be of use in the treatment of renal fibrosis.</p>

<p>A minor increase in urinary albumin excretion (microalbuminuria) is known to predict adverse renal and cardiovascular events in diabetic and hypertensive patients. Recent intriguing findings show that microalbuminuria is an early and sensitive marker of future cardiovascular events even in healthy subjects. The mechanisms linking microalbuminuria with end-organ damage have not been fully explained yet; however, generalized endothelial dysfunction might play an important role. Prevailing experimental and clinical data suggest that generalized endothelial dysfunction, frequently characterized by decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, actually precedes the development of microalbuminuria. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the intricate relationship between microalbuminuria and endothelial dysfunction. On the basis of the current evidence, we propose that microalbuminuria and endothelial dysfunction are an emerging target for primary prevention strategies in cardiovascular disease. In near future, dietary components improving nitric oxide bioavailability, such as cocoa-derived flavanols may play important role in these preventive strategies.</p>

<p>It was demonstrated that individual renal endothelial dilatory function of the healthy rat predicts susceptibility to subsequent renal damage induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. In addition, it is reported that myocardial infarction (MI) that was performed upon unilateral nephrectomy (UNx) induced highly variable renal damage. Therefore, whether the variability in renal damage after MI could be explained by the variation in individual renal endothelial function before the induction of injury was studied. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was investigated in vitro in small arteries that were isolated from the extirpated kidney at UNx. MI was induced 1 wk after UNx by ligation of the left coronary artery. Proteinuria and systolic BP were evaluated weekly for 16 wk thereafter using metabolic cages and the tail-cuff method, respectively. Upon termination of the study, focal glomerulosclerosis was evaluated by histology as an additional marker of renal damage. After MI, nephrectomized male Wistar rats (n = 15) gradually developed variable proteinuria, ranging from 20 to 507 mg/24 h at week 16, with an average systolic BP of 131 +/- 7 mmHg. The individual renal endothelial function of the healthy rats predicted the extent of renal damage in terms of proteinuria (r = -0.62, P = 0.008) and focal glomerulosclerosis (r = -0.70, P = 0.003). The individual level of renal endothelial function in the healthy rat is able to predict the severity of renal damage that is induced by MI. Further exploration of the underlying mechanisms may lead to discovery of preventive renoprotective therapies.</p>

<p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) reduce proteinuria and protect the kidney in proteinuric renal disease. During ACE-I therapy, circulating levels of angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)] are increased. As cardiac and renal protective effects of Ang (1-7) have been reported, we questioned whether Ang (1-7) contributes to the anti-proteinuric effects of ACE-I treatment. Therefore, we evaluated whether Ang (1-7) infusion reduces proteinuria in a rat model of adriamycin-induced renal disease. In addition, the effect of a selective Ang (1-7) blocker, [D-Ala7]-Ang (1-7) (A779), was investigated in rats treated with the ACE-I, lisinopril (LIS). Six weeks after induction of proteinuria, therapy was started in four different groups: control, Ang (1-7), LIS, and LIS+A779. After two weeks, the rats were sacrificed. Six weeks after injection of adriamycin, the rats had developed proteinuria of 323+/-40 mg/24 hours. The proteinuria remained stable in the control group and in the Ang (1-7) group, but was reduced in both LIS and LIS+A779-treated groups. Similarly, blood pressure (BP) was unchanged in the control and the Ang (1-7) groups, but reduced in both the LIS and the LIS+A779 groups. Plasma levels of Ang (1-7) were increased in the Ang (1-7) and in both LIS-treated groups. We conclude that systemic Ang (1-7) plays no major role in the anti-proteinuric and BPlowering effects of ACE-I in this rat model of adriamycin-induced nephrosis.</p>

<p>Application of gene therapy to the renal graft has a powerful potential to improve the outcome of kidney transplantation and eliminate detrimental side effects associated with systemic therapy, through local expression of immunoregulatory or other protective molecules. However, the search for the optimal vector is still ongoing. In this study, we used a modified adenovirus that has an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif inserted in the HI loop of the fiber knob, as a successful strategy to transduce the renal graft. Donor Lewis rat kidneys were infused via the renal artery with a solution containing either a fiber-modified adenovirus (AdTL-RGD) or an unmodified adenovirus (AdTL), or with saline. Syngeneic recipients were killed after 3, 7 or 14 days. Efficiency, selectivity, localization, time course of gene expression and side effects were studied using biochemical and immunohistological techniques. Enhanced gene expression was achieved selectively in the transplanted kidney by AdTL-RGD, when compared to AdTL. Transgene expression lasted for at least 2 weeks. With the AdTL-RGD vector, the transgene was abundantly expressed in the renal interstitial fibroblasts. An increase in the number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes accompanied the use of either vector, when compared to saline. These data convincingly show enhanced and selective gene transfer to the fibroblasts of transplanted kidneys using an RGD-modified adenovirus, providing a highly efficient vector system for future therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) treatment in a rat model of post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure.BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin, traditionally known as a hematopoietic hormone, has been linked to neovascularization. Whereas administration of EPO acutely after MI reduces infarct size and improves cardiac function, its role in the failing heart is unknown.METHODS: Rats underwent coronary ligation or sham surgery. Rats with MI were randomly assigned to: untreated (MI), a single bolus of EPO immediately after MI induction (MI-EPO-early), EPO treatment immediately after MI and once every three weeks (MI-EPO-early+late), and EPO treatment starting three weeks after induction of MI, once every three weeks (MI-EPO-late). After nine weeks, hemodynamics, infarct size, myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, myocyte hypertrophy, and capillary density were measured.RESULTS: Erythropoietin treatment started immediately after MI (MI-EPO-early and MI-EPO-early+late) resulted in a 23% to 30% reduction in infarct size (p &lt; 0.01) and, accordingly, hemodynamic improvement. Erythropoietin treatment, started three weeks after MI (MI-EPO-late), did not affect infarct size, but resulted in an improved cardiac performance, reflected by a 34% reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p &lt; 0.01), and 46% decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide levels (p &lt; 0.05). The improved cardiac function was accompanied by an increased capillary density (p &lt; 0.01), an increased capillary-to-myocyte ratio (p &lt; 0.05), and a partial reversal of beta-MHC (p &lt; 0.05) in all treated groups.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to its effect on infarct size reduction, EPO treatment improves cardiac function in a rat model of post-MI heart failure. This observation may be explained by neovascularization, associated with an increased alpha-MHC expression.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: High-sodium intake blunts the renoprotective efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We investigated whether targeting the drug to the kidneys may attenuate the inferior response to ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) under high-sodium conditions. The ACE-I, captopril, was coupled to the low molecular weight protein (LMWP) lysozyme, yielding captopril-lysozyme conjugates that accumulate specifically in the proximal tubular cells of the kidneys. We compared the antiproteinuric efficacy of captopril to that of the captopril-lysozyme conjugate in adriamycin-induced proteinuric rats fed with a high-sodium diet.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats with adriamycin (single injection 2 mg/kg)- induced proteinuria were put on a high-sodium diet (HS; 3% NaCl). When stable proteinuria developed at 5.5 weeks, animals were assigned to the following subcutaneous treatments: (1) vehicle (n=7); (2) lysozyme (equivalent to the amount in conjugate) (n=7); (3) captopril (5 mg/kg/24 hours) (n=8); (4) captopril-lysozyme conjugate (captopril content equivalent to 1mg captopril/kg/24 hours) (n=7). Blood pressure and proteinuria were monitored. After 10 days of treatment the rats were sacrificed and kidneys and plasma were removed.RESULTS: Results are given as mean + S.E.M. After injection with adriamycin at t=0, stable proteinuria developed, amounting to 547+79 mg/24 hours at week 5.5. Subsequently, after seven and nine days of treatment, no reduction of proteinuria was observed in the captopril-treated group. In contrast, a significant reduction in proteinuria, amounting to 35+4% (day seven) and 25+2% (day nine), was observed in the captopril-lysozyme conjugate group (p&lt;0.05 compared with the captopril group). In contrast, blood pressure was reduced in the captopril-treated group by 13.9+2.9 mmHg, while in the captopril-lysozyme treated group, an increase of 7.9+3.3 mmHg was found. Renal ACE activity was lowered by 30% in the captopril, as well as in the captopril-lysozyme conjugate treated group, compared with control. Furthermore, the ratio of kidney: plasma levels of captopril almost doubled as a consequence of coupling to lysozyme.CONCLUSION: In proteinuric rats fed with a high-sodium diet, captopril induced a reduction in blood pressure without an effect on proteinuria. In contrast, renal targeting of a five times lower dose of the ACE-I with the captopril-lysozyme conjugate reduced proteinuria without reducing blood pressure. Therefore, renal targeting of ACE-I may be a promising strategy to optimise the therapeutic response of ACE-I.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] has been identified as a versatile, endogenous inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). As the therapeutic response to exogenous RAS inhibitors, such as AT1 receptor antagonists, is altered by changes in salt intake, we investigated the effect of a low, normal and high sodium diet on the antagonism of Ang II by Ang-(1-7). The role of angiotensin receptor subtypes and the endothelium was assessed.METHODS: Male Wistar rats received a normal sodium (0.3% NaCl), high sodium (2.0% NaCl) or low sodium (0.05% NaCl) diet for 10 days. Vascular responses were assessed ex vivo in thoracic aortic rings in the presence of the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) to avoid aspecific vasodilator effects of Ang-(1-7).RESULTS: After a normal or high salt diet, Ang-(1-7) significantly decreased maximal Ang II-induced vascular constrictions by 40-50%. After a low salt diet this non-competitive antagonism disappeared. The AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319 and the Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist A779 attenuated the effect of Ang-(1-7) found in rats fed with a normal or high sodium diet. Further, removal of endothelium and pretreatment with the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 mol/l) abolished the non-competitive antagonism by Ang-(1-7).CONCLUSION: Ang-(1-7) elicits a specific, endothelium-dependent and non-competitive antagonism of Ang II, which involves AT2 and Ang-(1-7) receptors but is independent of NO production. This non-competitive antagonism of Ang-(1-7) is abolished by a low sodium intake in normotensive rats, suggesting that it serves as a negative feedback towards Ang II in response to an altered sodium intake.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: The heptapeptide Angiotensin-(1-7) [(Ang-(1-7)] is a biologically active component of the Renin-Angiotensin System. Pharmacological studies often involve Ang-(1-7) radioactively labelled with (125)I. Given the small size of the original peptide, we investigated whether introduction of a rather bulky iodine label interferes with the biological activity of Ang-(1-7).METHODS: Ang-(1-7) was labelled with nonradioactive iodine with the chloramine-T method. The reaction products were separated on HPLC and analysed with mass spectrometry. The products were tested for biological activity in two ways: The ability of labelled Ang-(1-7) to block Ang II-induced contraction in rat aortic rings was tested in an organ bath setup. The affinity of labelled angiotensin for ACE in rat plasma was examined in vitro.RESULTS: Iodination of Angiotensin-(1-7) resulted in two main products: monoiodinated and diiodinated Ang-(1-7) that could be easily separated on HPLC. In an organ bath experiment, monoiodinated Ang-(1-7) blocked Ang II responses identical to the native compound, whereas diiodinated Ang-(1-7) had lost its ability to block Ang II responses. Likewise, monoiodinated Ang-(1-7) had retained its affinity for ACE, while the affinity of diiodinated Ang-(1-7) was greatly reduced.DISCUSSION: Monoiodinated Ang-(1-7) has a biological activity identical to the native compound, whereas this is lost in diiodinated Ang-(1-7). Therefore, only the monoiodinated radioactive form seems suited for pharmacological studies.</p>

<p>Studied were the effects of myocardial infarction (MI) on mild renal function loss in unilateral nephrectomized (UnX) rats. UnX was performed, followed after 1 wk by a variable MI (UnX + MI; n = 24). Rats with only UnX (n = 15) or MI (n = 9) and double sham animals (CON, n = 15) served as controls. Renal outcome was measured by proteinuria and plasma creatinine. Focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) incidence was evaluated by renal histology. Cardiac function and systolic BP were measured. A division into small and large infarcts after UnX was made a priori, resulting in two groups, one with a mild MI (&lt;20%; n = 15) and one with a moderate MI (&gt;20%; n = 9). Mild proteinuria up to 55.5 mg/d was observed in the UnX + mild MI group, whereas proteinuria rose significantly higher to 124.5 mg/d in the UnX + moderate MI group. Incidence of FGS was significantly increased in both UnX + MI groups compared with all other groups. The average MI size was 18%, 17%, and 25% in the MI, UnX + mild MI, and UnX + moderate MI group, respectively. LVP in both UnX + MI groups was correlated with proteinuria, indicative of a cardio-renal interaction. Clinically, these data imply that more patients are at risk for cardiovascular events and that after such an event, their chance of more renal function loss increases. Finding the underlying mechanism will enable improved protection for both kidneys and heart.</p>

<p>Postoperative renal function deterioration is a serious complication after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. However, the long-term prognosis of patients with postoperative renal deterioration is not fully determined yet. Therefore, both in-hospital mortality and long-term survival were studied in patients with postoperative renal function deterioration. Included were 843 patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in 1991. Postoperative renal function deterioration (increase in serum creatinine in the first postoperative week of at least 25%) occurred in 145 (17.2%) patients. In these patients, in-hospital mortality was 14.5%, versus 1.1% in patients without renal function deterioration (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis significantly associated in-hospital mortality with postoperative renal function deterioration, re-exploration, postoperative cerebral stroke, duration of operation, age, and diabetes. In patients who were discharged alive, during long-term follow-up (100 mo), mortality was significantly increased in the patients with renal function deterioration (n = 124) as compared with those without renal function deterioration (hazard ratio 1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 3.20). Also after adjustment for other independently associated factors, the risk for mortality in patients with postoperative renal function deterioration remained elevated (hazard ratio 1.63; 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.32). The elevated risk for long-term mortality was independent of whether renal function had recovered at discharge from hospital. It is concluded that postoperative renal function deterioration in cardiac surgical patients not only results in increased in-hospital mortality but also adversely affects long-term survival.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that erythropoietin (EPO) plays a protective role in brain ischemia. In this condition, administration of EPO protects neurons from ischemic damage. Recently, it has been shown that in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), EPO treatment improved cardiac function. In the present study we assessed the role of EPO and EPO-receptor (EPO-R) in the heart.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the presence and functionality of the EPO-R in isolated rat hearts in the Langendorff set-up. Hearts were perfused for 20 min with 10 U/ml EPO or vehicle. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of the EPO-R on endothelial cells, fibroblasts and to a lesser extent cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, perfusion with EPO resulted in a 50% increase in the phosphorylated MAP kinases p42/p44. To evaluate the protective role of EPO in cardiac ischemia, we performed low-flow (0.6 ml/min) ischemia/reperfusion experiments in isolated rat hearts. Administration of EPO (10 U/ml) reduced the cellular damage by 56% (P&lt;0.05) during reperfusion, diminished apoptosis by 15% (P&lt;0.05) and resulted in a significantly improved recovery of left ventricular pressure (P=0.02) and coronary flow (P=0.01).CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that a functional EPO-R is present in rat adult cardiac tissue and that exogenous EPO administration improves cardiac function after ischemia/reperfusion injury.</p>

<p>Hibernating animals transiently reduce renal function during their hypothermic periods (torpor), while completely restoring it during their periodical rewarming to euthermia (arousal). Moreover, structural integrity of the kidney is preserved throughout the hibernation. Nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a crucial vasodilatory mediator and a protective factor in the kidney. We investigated renal NOS expression in hibernating European ground squirrels after 1 day and 7 days of torpor (torpor short, TS, and torpor long, TL, respectively), at 1.5 and at 10 h of rewarming (arousal short, AS, and arousal long, AL, respectively), and in continuously euthermic animals after hibernation (EU). For that purpose, we performed NOS activity assay, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR analysis. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decreased glomerular eNOS expression in hibernating animals (TS, TL, AS, and AL) compared to non-hibernating animals (EU, p &lt; 0.05), whereas no difference was found in the expression of interstitial eNOS. Expression of iNOS and nNOS did not differ between all groups. The reduced glomerular eNOS was associated with a significantly lower eNOS mRNA levels and NOS activity of whole kidney during torpor and arousal (TS, TL, AS, and AL) compared to EU. In all methods used, torpid and aroused squirrels did not differ. These results demonstrate differential regulation of eNOS in glomeruli and interstitium of hibernating animals, which is unaffected during arousal. The differential regulation of eNOS may serve to reduce ultrafiltration without jeopardizing tubular structures during hibernation.</p>

<p>Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone known to stimulate hematopoiesis. However, recent research suggests additional properties of EPO, such as protection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in various tissues. We studied the effect of timing of EPO administration on cardioprotection during I/R in the heart. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45 minutes of coronary occlusion, followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Animals were randomized to receive saline or single dose of EPO (5,000 IU/kg) either 2 hours before I/R, at the start of ischemia, or after the onset of reperfusion. The ratio of infarct area/area at risk (planimetry), left ventricular (LV) function (pressure development), and apoptosis (number of active caspase-3 positive cells) were determined after 24-hour reperfusion. Administration of EPO during different time points resulted in a 19 to 23% (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in the infarct area/area at risk, which was accompanied by a trend toward better LV hemodynamic parameters. Apoptosis was significantly attenuated in groups treated with EPO at the start of ischemia (29% reduction) and after the onset of reperfusion (38%), and to a lesser extent (16%) in the group pre-treated with EPO. Thus, in vivo administration of EPO at different time points protects the myocardial structure and preserves cardiac function during I/R. Cardioprotective effect of EPO is associated with inhibition of apoptosis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: In cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), corticosteroids are administered to attenuate the physiological changes caused by the systemic inflammatory response. The effects of corticosteroids on CPB-associated renal damage have not been documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on perioperative renal dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.METHODS: Renal damage was prospectively studied in 20 patients without concomitant morbidity undergoing coronary artery surgery with CPB. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive dexamethasone or placebo. Markers of glomerular function (creatinine clearance) and damage (microalbuminuria), and markers of tubular function (fractional excretion of sodium and free water clearance) and damage (N-acetyl-beta-D glucosaminidase (NAG)) were evaluated in addition to plasma and urinary glucose levels. Plasma and urinary specimens were obtained at the following time periods: (1) baseline, during the 12 h before surgery; (2) skin incision before heparinization; (3) from heparinization until the end of CPB; (4) during the 2 h following weaning from CPB; (5) in the intensive care unit from 2 to 6 h after weaning of CBP; (6) and from 36 to 60 h after weaning of CPB.RESULTS: CPB was associated with an increase in markers in the placebo group, which returned to baseline during the second postoperative day, demonstrating a transient impairment of glomerular and tubular renal function. Similar patterns were observed in patients treated with dexamethasone. While postoperative glycosuria was significantly higher in the dexamethasone-treated group, no other differences between groups were observed.CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone administration before CPB has no protective effect on perioperative renal dysfunction in low-risk cardiac surgical patients.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: A high throughput animal model may enhance pathophysiological studies to mechanisms of in-stent restenosis (ISR). More and appropriate antibodies and transgenic and knockout strains are available in rats. Consequently, a model for ISR in the rat would be convenient for pathobiological studies. Here we present the full characteristics of a rat ISR model suitable for high throughput stent research.METHODS: The abdominal aorta of rats was separated from surrounding tissue and a BeStenttrade mark 2 or a Cyphertrade mark sirolimus-eluting stent was locally inserted. After 1, 3, 7, 28 and 56 days, the aortas were harvested, fixed, embedded and cut. Morphometric analysis was performed and inflammation scored.RESULTS: The neointimal area increased to a maximum after 28 days (0.55 +/- 0.08 mm(2)). Subsequently, the neointimal area slightly decreased. The injury score and the neointimal area were linearly correlated (r = 0.85, p &lt; 0.01). Thrombus formation was present after 1 day. Leukocyte adherence was evident after 1 day, maximal after 3 days (93 +/- 21 cells/section) and decreased thereafter. The inflammation score increased after 3 days to a maximum after 7 days (1.37 +/- 0.06) and declined thereafter. After 28 days the Cypher sirolimus-eluting stent decreased the stenosis in comparison to the BeStent 2 (10.2 +/- 0.85 vs. 18.0 +/- 2.0%, respectively, p &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Stent deployment in the rat abdominal aorta results in thrombus formation, inflammation and neointimal formation. Moreover, there is a linear correlation between the injury score and the neointimal area. These responses resemble ISR events as seen in other animal models. Moreover, a known anti-restenotic stent also reduces neointimal formation in this model. Rat abdominal aorta stenting is a promising animal model for ISR, it is suitable for testing commercially manufactured stents and studying the pathophysiology of ISR.</p>

<p>Gene therapy is emerging as a realistic addition to the therapeutic arsenal in heart failure, but the search for suitable vectors for cardiac transfection is still ongoing. In this study, we explore the applicability of recombinant Semliki Forest virus (SFV) in heart failure. SFV was intracoronarily delivered 2 weeks after induction of myocardial infarction in the rat model for heart failure. Duration of SFV expression was determined, and tissue distribution was studied by histochemical, biochemical, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. Expression of SFV-mediated transfection in the heart reached its maximum after 48-72 h and subsided within a week. Intracoronary administration of SFV efficiently transfected the non-infarcted cardiac wall, resulting in high levels of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity (1337 +/- 537 IU/mg) and lacZ RNA in the hearts of all rats, whereas brain, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and testis were lacZ negative. In conclusion, intracoronarily delivered SFV has a favourable distribution pattern, showing expression of the transgene restricted to the heart.</p>

<p>Renal gene therapy may offer new strategies to treat diseases of native and transplanted kidneys. Several experimental techniques have been developed and employed using nonviral, viral, and cellular vectors. The most efficient vector for in vivo transfection appears to be adenovirus. Glomeruli, blood vessels, interstitial cells, and pyelum can be transfected with high efficiency. In addition, electroporation and microbubbles with ultrasound, both being enhanced naked plasmid techniques, offer good opportunities. Trapping of mesangial cells into the glomeruli as well as natural targeting of monocytes or macrophages to inflamed kidneys are elegant methods for site-specific delivery of genes. For gene therapy in kidney transplantation, hemagglutinating virus of Japan liposomes are efficient vectors for tubular transfection, whereas enhanced naked plasmid techniques are suitable for glomerular transfection. However, adenovirus offers the best opportunities in a renal transplantation setup because varying parameters of graft perfusion allows targeting of different cell types. In renal grafts, lymphocytes can be used for selective targeting to sites of inflammation. In conclusion, for both in vivo and ex vivo renal transfection, enhanced naked plasmids and adenovirus offer the best perspectives for effective clinical application. Moreover, the development of safer, nonimmunogenic vectors and the large-scale production could make clinical renal gene therapy a realistic possibility for the near future.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disease. Previously, clinical and animal experimental studies in AF revealed a variety of myocyte remodeling processes including L-type Ca(2+) channel reduction and structural changes, which finally result in electrical remodeling and contractile dysfunction. There are indications that myocyte remodeling is mediated by Ca(2+) overload induced calpain activation. To study in more detail the mechanisms underlying myocyte remodeling and to develop strategies for drug-interference, we utilised a paced cell model for AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: HL-1 atrial myocytes were subjected to a 10 times increase in rate over basal values by electrical field stimulation at 5 Hz. It was found that 24-h pacing reduced plasmalemmal levels of L-type Ca(2+) channel alpha 1C subunit by -72% compared to controls. No changes in amount of the potassium channel subunits Kv4.3 and Kv1.5 were found. Pacing also induced marked structural changes; myolysis and nuclear condensation, paralleled by a 14-fold increase in calpain activity. The pacing-induced reduction of L-type Ca(2+) channel protein was fully prevented by treatment with verapamil, the active stereoisomer of methoxyverapamil D600, the calpain inhibitors PD150606 and E64d, and LaCl(3). Interestingly, PD150606, E64d and LaCl(3), but not (methoxy)verapamil, prevented structural changes.CONCLUSIONS: Paced HL-1 atrial myocytes undergo myocyte remodeling similar to that found in myocytes from patients with AF. Calcium influx independent of the L-type Ca(2+) channel and subsequent activation of calpain represent key features in the progression towards overt structural changes. Calpain inhibition may therefore represent a useful lead for therapeutic intervention in AF.</p>

<p>Proteinuria is assumed to play a pathogenetic role in progressive renal damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduces proteinuria and provides renoprotection. This suggests that ACE activity might play a pathogenetic role in the development of proteinuria-induced renal structural damage. We investigated this hypothesis in untreated and treated established adriamycin nephrosis, a model of proteinuria-induced renal damage. In a time-course experiment, the development of renal structural damage in untreated adriamycin nephrotic rats was paralleled by a significant rise in renal ACE activity. Moreover, on cross-sectional analysis, a consistent positive correlation between renal, but not plasma, ACE activity and proteinuria, focal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial injury was present. Notably, these associations were present, not only in the untreated condition, but also during intervention with either ACE inhibition or AT(1)-receptor antagonism. Interestingly, we found that higher renal ACE activity is associated with more severe renal damage for a given amount of proteinuria, suggesting that renal ACE activity may be either a permissive or a promoting factor in the processes by which proteinuria eventually leads to renal structural damage. This relationship was abolished by renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blockade, suggesting that RAS-mediated effects are involved in the relationship between renal ACE activity and proteinuria-induced renal damage. In conclusion, in untreated as well as treated adriamycin nephrotic rats, renal ACE activity is closely associated with renal outcome. This association appears to be independent of the specific mode of blockade of the RAS. Renal ACE activity is a consistent marker of individual differences in proteinuria-associated renal damage: further studies are needed to investigate a possible pathogenetic role in renal damage.</p>

<p>Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) overactivity has been implied in progressive renal function loss. We investigated whether changes in the renal expression of RAS components are specifically associated with the proteinuric kidney. Unilateral adriamycin-induced proteinuria was obtained by clamping the left renal artery before injection of adriamycin. In control animals, both left and right renal arteries were clamped. Twelve weeks later, mRNA expression of RAS components was determined in both kidneys. In the affected and non-affected kidney of the unilateral proteinuric rat, we demonstrate up-regulation of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA (213%+22 and 188%+24 of controls, respectively), up-regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) mRNA (956%+229 and 418%+56) and down-regulation of angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2-R) mRNA (24%+5 and 20%+5). The expression of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1-R) mRNA and inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate receptor type I (IP3R-I) mRNA were unchanged. In conclusion, renal expression of ACE, AT2-R, and AT1-R mRNA is not mediated by protein leakage. Local intrarenal protein leakage did influence renal TGF-beta mRNA expression.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The rat coronary ligation model of chronic heart failure has been extensively used to investigate its pathophysiology including the role of endothelial dysfunction. Inconsistent results have been obtained concerning the role of endothelial dilative mediators nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF).AIMS: Our aim was to investigate involvement of NO and EDHF in aortic endothelial dysfunction in this model and the influence of individual infarct sizes. Furthermore, we investigated whether it is justified to regard rats that failed to develop large infarct sizes as SHAM controls.METHODS: We performed coronary ligations and SHAM operations and studied acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxations and underlying endothelial mediators in isolated aortic rings 12 weeks after infarction. By then, cardiac and hemodynamic parameters were deteriorated in animals with large myocardial infarctions (large-MI, 35+/-3%), but not those with small myocardial infarctions (small-MI, 5+/-2%).RESULTS: Large-MI showed decreased ACh-induced relaxation compared to SHAM due to decreased contribution of EDHF which was inversely correlated with individual infarct-size. Interestingly, small-MI showed significantly increased ACh-induced relaxation compared to SHAM due to increased NO contribution.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that impaired aortic endothelial dilatory function in large-MI is mainly due to an impaired EDHF response and strongly depends on individual infarct-size. In addition, endothelium-dependent relaxation of small-MI rats differed from SHAM, indicating that both groups may not be pooled to serve as controls. These results emphasize the importance of infarct-size and choice of the control group, and may explain inconsistencies in previous studies.</p>

<p>In hypertension, pressure-induced myogenic constriction and impaired endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated dilation may contribute to increased vasomotor tone. Myogenic constriction as well as EDHF-mediated dilation may share common signaling mechanisms, and both may control KCa channel activity to set arterial tone. To investigate a potential relation between the 2 mechanisms, we studied coronary arteries of Sprague-Dawley rats for individual myogenic constriction compared with EDHF-mediated dilation of the same artery. EDHF-mediated dilation was measured as the maximal dilation to acetylcholine (100 micromol/L) after preconstriction, resistant to NO inhibition (NG-methyl-l-arginine acetate salt, L-NMMA, 100 micromol/L), and prostaglandin inhibition (indomethacin, 10 micromol/L) but abolished by charybdotoxin (100 nmol/L) plus apamin (500 nmol/L). Individual coronary myogenic constriction at an intraluminal pressure of 70 mm Hg (n=9) ranged from 6% to 44% (24+/-4%). EDHF-mediated dilation ranged from 18% to 84% (42+/-7%). Elevating pressure to 130 mm Hg (n=8) increased myogenic constriction by 2-fold (P&lt;0.01) and decreased EDHF-mediated dilation by 2.6-fold (P&lt;0.01). Interestingly, individual myogenic constriction inversely correlated to individual EDHF-mediated dilation (r=-0.75, P&lt;0.001, n=17). Pretreatment with the KCa channel opener NS1619 (30 micromol/L) prevented coronary myogenic constriction and increased EDHF-mediated dilation by 2.2-fold (P&lt;0.01), whereas the KATP channel opener cromakalim (3 micromol/L) had no effect on EDHF-mediated dilation. For comparison, in mesenteric arteries (at 70 mm Hg) low myogenic constriction (2+/-1%) was associated with high EDHF-mediated dilation (93+/-2%), and pretreatment with NS1619 had no effect. Our results demonstrate that myogenic constriction in coronary arteries antagonizes EDHF-mediated dilation. Activation of KCa channels with NS1619 reduces myogenic constriction and profoundly increases EDHF-mediated dilation, specifically in coronary arteries, suggesting a potential therapeutic impact to reduce coronary risk in hypertension.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: As bladder distension related to anaesthesia puts patients at risk for permanent dysfunction, peri-operative determination of bladder volume is of great importance. The aim of this study is to validate an ultrasonic imaging device for determing bladder urine volume.METHOD: To evaluate a broad volume range, ultrasonically scanned volumes were compared to true urinary volumes both in surgical patients and in volunteers. After institutional approval and informed consent 60 healthy volunteers were asked not to void for as long as possible. After ultrasound measurements (BladderScan BVI 2500, Diagnostic Ultrasound, Redmond WA, U.S.A.) they voided and true urinary volumes were measured. Fifty surgical patients scheduled for procedures requiring urinary catheterisation were studied. Pre- and post-induction of anaesthesia ultrasound measurements were recorded, followed by urinary catheterisation and measurement of true urinary volume. Urine volumes were compared using Student t-tests and Wilcoxon Rank Tests (p &lt; 0.05). For validation linear regression was used together with Bland-Altman analyses.RESULTS: Ultrasonic scanning underestimated the true urine volume by about 7% over the whole volume range (17 ml to 970 ml). Underestimation was larger in females than in males (p &lt; 0.02). R2 values for correlation of measured and scanned urinary volumes ranged between 0.92 and 0.95. Bland and Altman analyses showed a bias of 31 ml in volunteers and of 19 ml in patients and a precision of 110 ml and 80 ml, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasonic imaging device can be used peri-operatively to establish bladder volume, taking into account the 7% underestimation of the bladder volume.</p>

<p>Nitric oxide is a versatile molecule, with its actions ranging from haemodynamic regulation to anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. Nitric oxide is produced by the nitric oxide synthases, endothelial NOS (eNOS), neural NOS (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). Constitutively expressed eNOS produces low concentrations of NO, which is necessary for a good endothelial function and integrity. Endothelial derived NO is often seen as a protective agent in a variety of diseases. This review will focus on the potential protective role of eNOS. We will discuss recent data derived from studies in eNOS knockout mice and other experimental models. Furthermore, the role of eNOS in human diseases is described and possible therapeutic intervention strategies will be discussed.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Control of blood pressure (BP) and optimal reduction of proteinuria (Uprot) are necessary for long-term renoprotection. Unfortunately, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists are not effective during sodium repletion. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) cause dual inhibition of ACE and neutral endopeptidase, the latter resulting in decreased atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) breakdown and thus enhanced natriuresis. Therefore, in contrast with ACEI, VPI may be effective during high sodium intake.METHODS: To test this hypothesis, the renoprotective actions of the new VPI gemopatrilat (GEM) were studied during low (0.05% NaCl) and high (3.0% NaCl) sodium diets in normotensive Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. The ACEI lisinopril (LIS) was used as control. Rats received either GEM (0.3 mg/g chow), an equihypotensive dose of LIS (75 mg/L drinking water), or vehicle (VEH) from week 6 (that is, established Uprot) until sacrifice. The effect of therapy was monitored by measuring systolic BP and Uprot (weekly) and structural renal damage at the end of study (week 16).RESULTS: During low sodium, GEM effectively reduced Uprot (-48 +/- 4%), but LIS was more effective (-80 +/- 2%), while Uprot slightly increased in VEH (+23 +/- 2%). The focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) score after GEM (38 +/- 14) was lower than in the VEH group (79 +/- 27), although this was not significant. LIS (18 +/- 6) reduced FGS significantly. Remarkably, on high sodium, GEM was completely ineffective in reducing BP, Uprot and structural renal injury, just like LIS.CONCLUSIONS: The renoprotective actions of VPI depend on dietary sodium intake in normotensive nephrotic rats: therapeutic efficacy is fully blunted by a high sodium diet. During a low sodium diet, gemopatrilat was renoprotective, but less effective than lisinopril. Whether higher doses of the VPI could improve its renoprotective efficacy remains to be elucidated.</p>

<p>In experimental animal models of renal disease the degree of renal damage varies between individuals. This could be caused by variation in the noxious event or by differences in individual susceptibility. Intact endothelial function is assumed to provide a defense mechanism against progressive renal damage. This study hypothesized that interindividual differences in renal endothelial function might be involved in individual susceptibility to renal damage, and it investigated whether endothelial function of small renal arteries before induction of 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) in rats was related to development of renal damage after 5/6 Nx. Wistar rats underwent 5/6 Nx, and small renal arteries of the removed right kidney were investigated for endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh, 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L). The contribution of underlying endothelial dilative mediators, NO, prostaglandins (PG), and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), was assessed using the inhibitors, L-NMMA, indomethacin, and charybdotoxin+apamin, respectively. After 5/6 Nx, proteinuria developed in each rat ranging from 22 to 278 (84 +/- 14) mg/24 h at week 5 (n = 23). Interestingly, a significant inverse correlation between individual ACh-relaxation (expressed as area under curve in arbitrary units) and proteinuria 5 wk after 5/6 Nx was found (r = -0.54; P = 0.008; n = 23). An inverse correlation was also found between individual NO contribution as well as PG contribution and proteinuria 5 wk after 5/6 Nx (r = -0.86, P = 0.001, n = 11; and r = -0.74, P = 0.01, n = 11, respectively). In addition, individual ACh-relaxation was positively correlated with GFR measured 6 wk after 5/6 Nx (r = 0.58; P = 0.016; n = 17). This study demonstrates for the first time that individual renal endothelial dilatory function of the healthy rat predicts susceptibility to renal damage after 5/6 Nx, which seems to depend on individual endothelial NO and PG activity.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The antiproteinuric effect of combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist losartan was compared to that of the optimal antiproteinuric doses of monotherapy.METHODS: To this purpose, lisinopril and losartan were studied in 9 nondiabetic renal patients with median proteinuria 4.5 g/day (95% CI, 3.5, 6.4), creatinine clearance of 80 mL/min (95% CI, 66, 96), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 102 mm Hg (95% CI, 93, 112). First, in two protocols with six-week treatment periods per dose, the optimal antiproteinuric dose of each drug was established in each patient. Losartan and lisinopril were used in randomized order, each preceded by a baseline period without medication. The doses of losartan (mg/day) were 50, 100, 150, and again 50. The lisinopril doses were 10, 20, 40, and again 10. After the second protocol, patients were treated with a combination, using the optimal antiproteinuric doses established for the individual drugs.RESULTS: The antiproteinuric response by losartan was optimal at 100 mg (-46%; 95% CI, -60, -24%), being larger than at the 50 mg dose (-27%; 95% CI, -42, -4%, P &lt; 0.05), but not different from the 150 mg dose (-46%; 95% CI, -58; -20%). Proteinuria decreased further at each up-titration step of lisinopril to -75% (95% CI, -85, -43%) at the 40 mg dose. Combination therapy reduced proteinuria more effectively (-85%; 95% CI, -96, -58) than monotherapy with losartan, and to a lesser extent than with lisinopril. Optimal blood pressure responses were obtained at similar doses.CONCLUSIONS: Dose-titration with a renin-angiotensin system blocker, followed by add-on therapy is highly effective in order to reduce proteinuria. The safety of this regimen needs to be addressed in future studies.</p>

<p>Hypothermia is commonly used to restrict organ damage during preservation of tissue, but does not offer complete protection. Organ damage after reperfusion/rewarming is amongst others caused by an impairment of vascular properties, particularly endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. We hypothesized that hibernating small animals, which frequently cycle through periods of deep cooling (torpor) and full rewarming (arousal), employ specific mechanisms to preserve vascular function after cooling and reperfusion. Therefore we measured contraction of aortic tissue of hibernating European ground squirrels after 24 h and 7 days of torpor, arousal (1.5 h) and in non-hibernating animals. To assess the role of nitric oxide (NO), experiments were performed in the absence and presence of the NO-synthesis inhibitor, L-NMMA (10(-4) M). Maximum contraction to phenylephrine and angiotensin II was doubled in 7-days torpid animals without a shift in EC50, compared to the other 3 groups. Maximum contraction to KCl was doubled in 7-days torpid animals compared to the arousal group and non-hibernating animals. Relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitrite in phenylephrine precontracted rings did not differ between groups. In the presence of L-NMMA, the maximum of concentration-response curves for all three vasoconstrictors was increased by about 30% in the arousal group, but unaffected in other groups. L-NMMA completely inhibited ACh-induced relaxation in 24-h torpid animals and non-hibernating animals, but only partially in 7-days torpid animals and in the arousal group. From this we conclude that vascular adaptation proceeds during torpor. Further, increased contractility of aortic tissue during long torpor returns to normal within 1.5 hours of arousal, which is associated with an increased basal NO synthesis. In addition, involvement of NO in agonist-mediated relaxation differs between the various stages of hibernation.Thus, hibernating animals have effectively developed mechanisms to preserve vascular function after cooling and rewarming.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is accompanied by electrical, structural and ion-channel protein remodeling. We tested if proteolysis by calpain and proteasome is activated during AF, and studied the relation with the remodeling processes.METHODS: Right atrial appendages were obtained from patients with paroxysmal (n=7) or persistent (n=10) lone AF and compared to controls (n=10) in sinus rhythm undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Proteolysis was measured using Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin. Protein expression of calpain I and II was assessed by Western-blot and calpain I localization by immunohistochemistry. Structural changes were quantified by counting atrial myocytes with contraction bands or hibernation.RESULTS: Calpain activity was significantly increased in paroxysmal AF (2-fold, P&lt;0.001) and persistent AF (3-fold, P&lt;0.001), mainly due to calpain I activation. Increased calpain I protein expression was found in AF with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Myocytes from all AF groups showed increased contraction bands, whereas hibernation was only found in persistent AF. Calpain activity correlated with L-type Ca(2+) channel and Kv1.5 protein amounts (r=-0.80, P&lt;0.001 and r=-0.72, P&lt;0.001, respectively), degree of structural changes (r=0.90, P&lt;0.001), shortening of atrial effective refractory period (AERP) (basic cycle length 500 ms, r=-0.60, P&lt;0.001) and AERP rate adaptation (r=-0.80, P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Calpain activity is induced during AF and correlates with parameters of ion-channel protein, structural and electrical remodeling. The results suggest that calpain activation represents an important mechanism linking calcium overload to cellular adaptation mechanisms in human AF.</p>

<p>An important acknowledgement of the last several years is that atrial fibrillation (AF) modifies the electrical properties of the atrium in a way that promotes its occurrence and maintenance. This arrhythmogenic electrophysiological remodeling is well established, but can not explain by itself that ‘AF begets AF’. This review describes molecular changes involving rapid functional alterations and slower changes in protein expression that cause electrical remodeling and contractile dysfunction in AF. An important molecular feature of AF is the reduction in L-type Ca(2+) channel function and protein expression. This reduction may serve to protect the cell against a potentially lethal Ca(2+) overload resulting from the increased activation rate in AF. Further, the review discusses the possible role of proteolytic systems, notably the calpains, as a mechanism linking Ca(2+) overload to reduced protein expression. Thus, it appears that the elaborate molecular changes in AF are directed primarily at protecting the myocyte from cellular stress. However, such early protection occurs at the expense of electrophysiological changes that promote the long-term maintenance of AF.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The Fisher to Lewis (F-L) model of renal transplantation (Rtx) is widely used. Rtx from F to L without immunosuppressive treatment results in 50% survival, whereas L to F results in survival rates similar to syngrafts. When treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or antihypertensive triple therapy, renal damage is markedly reduced in F-L allografts. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, the ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) is more effective than antihypertensive triple therapy, suggesting that the inhibition of intrarenal ACE plays an additional role in the attenuation of renal damage.METHODS: In the present study, we investigated strain-related differences in intrarenal ACE activity between F and L rats and whether treatment with ACE-I in F-L allografted rats results in reduction of intrarenal ACE. Intrarenal ACE was measured by activity assays, immunohistochemistry and PCR.RESULTS: In control kidneys from healthy F rats (n=8), we found a four-fold higher ACE activity than in native L rats (n=8, p&lt;0.01). This was confirmed by a three-fold difference in ACE mRNA expression (n=5 for both, p&lt;0.01). Using immunohistochemistry, we found strong tubular ACE expression in the F rat, whereas the L rat had no tubular ACE at all. In F-L allografts (n=9) we noted significant glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria after 34 weeks. Treatment with ACE-I in F-L (n=8) prevented the development of these changes. Although ACE mRNA and ACE protein expression were similar in treated and untreated allografts, intrarenal ACE activity was reduced by 50% in allografts with ACE-I.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, intrarenal levels of ACE may play a role in the development of renal damage in experimental chronic renal transplant failure.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: ACE inhibition exerts an antiproteinuric and renoprotective effect. However, residual proteinuria is often present. As residual proteinuria is associated with a poor renal outcome, identification of its determinants is important. We found previously that the systemic sequelae of proteinuria enhance renal damage in untreated nephrotic rats. The impact of systemic nephrosis on renal therapy response, however, is unclear. In the present study we therefore investigated whether the severity of systemic nephrosis, estimated from plasma cholesterol, predicts residual proteinuria during ACE inhibition.METHODS: Sixty male Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis were studied. Six weeks after the induction of nephrosis, rats were stratified for proteinuria and treated for 2 weeks with lisinopril (75 mg/l) or vehicle.RESULTS: At the start of treatment, median proteinuria was 744 mg/day (95% confidence interval (CI) 609-860) and plasma cholesterol was 10.4 mmol/l (95% CI 8.0-12.6), reflecting the state of systemic nephrosis. Lisinopril, but not vehicle, reduced blood pressure and proteinuria (-62%; range -70 to -48; P&lt;0.001). Residual proteinuria was 275 mg/day, with a wide range (47-1119 mg/day). Pre-treatment proteinuria and pre-treatment cholesterol correlated positively with residual proteinuria. By multivariate analysis (r(2) of model =0.92), both pre-treatment cholesterol and pre-treatment proteinuria were independent predictors of residual proteinuria. The quantitative impact of this multivariate analysis is illustrated by the difference in residual proteinuria between rats with a cholesterol:proteinuria ratio less than, compared with greater than, the median (residual proteinuria 298 mg/day (CI 129-496) vs 439 mg/day (CI 158-670), respectively). Blood pressure response was not predicted by the tested predictor variables.CONCLUSIONS: In this model of proteinuria-induced renal damage, not only proteinuria as such, but also the concomitant nephrotic alterations predict residual proteinuria. Further studies, applying specific interventions, are needed to determine which components of the systemic derangements could play a causal role in the modulation of therapy response.</p>

<p>STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) represents a specific risk factor for renal damage during coronary revascularization. The purpose of this study was to compare the perioperative renal damage in patients undergoing on-pump and off-pump coronary surgery.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: The progress and extent of renal damage was prospectively studied in two groups of patients undergoing cardiac surgery without concomitant morbidity, undergoing elective coronary revascularization with (n = 12) and without (n = 10) CPB. Markers of glomerular function (creatinine clearance) and damage (microalbuminuria), and markers of tubular function (fractional excretion of sodium [FENa] and free water clearance) and damage (N-acetyl-beta-D glucosaminidase [NAG]) were evaluated. Measuring plasma concentrations of free hemoglobin assessed hemolysis. Plasma and urinary specimens were obtained at the following points: (1) baseline; (2) heparinization; (3) the end of CPB or completing graft for off-pump surgery; (4) skin closure; (5) the sixth hour in the ICU; and (6) the second postoperative day. Free water and creatinine clearances, FENa, and the urinary excretion of microalbumin and NAG were calculated for the corresponding time intervals.SETTING: University hospital.RESULTS: We found that off-pump coronary revascularization induced significantly less changes in microalbuminuria, FENa, free water clearance, NAG, and free hemoglobin as compared with operations with CPB. Markers returned to baseline within 2 days after the operation, and there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of overt renal dysfunction in both groups.CONCLUSION: Off-pump coronary surgery attenuates transient renal injury compared with traditional on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key player in the progression of heart failure. Angiotensin-(1-7) is thought to modulate the activity of the RAS. Furthermore, this peptide may play a part in the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiovascular disease. We assessed the effects of angiotensin-(1-7) on the progression of heart failure.METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either coronary ligation or sham surgery. Two weeks after induction of myocardial infarction, intravenous infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) (24 microg/kg per hour) or saline was started by minipump. After 8 weeks of treatment, hemodynamic parameters were measured, endothelial function was assessed in isolated aortic rings, and plasma angiotensin-(1-7) levels were determined. Myocardial infarction resulted in a significant deterioration of left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressure, dP/dt, and coronary flow. Raising plasma levels 40-fold, angiotensin-(1-7) infusion attenuated this impairment to a nonsignificant level, markedly illustrated by a 40% reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Furthermore, angiotensin-(1-7) completely preserved aortic endothelial function, whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortas of saline-treated infarcted rats was significantly decreased.CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin-(1-7) preserved cardiac function, coronary perfusion, and aortic endothelial function in a rat model for heart failure.</p>

<p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is increased in the DD genotype, but the functional significance for renal function is unknown. Blunted responses of BP and proteinuria to ACE inhibition among DD renal patients during periods of high sodium intake were reported. It was therefore hypothesized that sodium status affects the phenotype in the ACE I/D polymorphism. The effects of angiotensin I (AngI) and AngII among 27 healthy subjects, with both low (50 mmol sodium/d) and liberal (200 mmol sodium/d) sodium intakes, were studied. Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) values, renal hemodynamic parameters, and renin-angiotensin system parameters were similar for all genotypes with either sodium intake level. With liberal sodium intake, the increases in MAP, renal vascular resistance, and aldosterone levels during AngI infusion (8 ng/kg per min) were significantly higher for the DD genotype, compared with the ID and II genotypes (all parameters presented as percent changes +/- 95% confidence intervals), with mean MAP increases of 22 +/- 2% (DD genotype), 13 +/- 5% (ID genotype), and 12 +/- 6% (II genotype) (P &lt; 0.05), mean increases in renal vascular resistance of 100.1 +/- 19.7% (DD genotype), 73.0 +/- 16.3% (ID genotype), and 63.2 +/- 16.9% (II genotype) (P &lt; 0.05), and increases in aldosterone levels of 650 +/- 189% (DD genotype), 343 +/- 71% (ID genotype), and 254 +/- 99% (II genotype) (P &lt; 0.05). Also, the decrease in GFR was more pronounced for the DD genotype, with mean decreases of 17.9 +/- 4.7% (DD genotype), 8.8 +/- 3.4% (ID genotype), and 6.4 +/- 5.9% (II genotype) (P &lt; 0.05). The effective renal plasma flow, plasma AngII concentration, and plasma renin activity values were similar for the genotypes. In contrast, with low sodium intake, the responses to AngI were similar for all genotypes. The responses to AngII were also similar for all genotypes, with either sodium intake level. In conclusion, the responses of MAP, renal hemodynamic parameters, and aldosterone concentrations to AngI are enhanced for the DD genotype with liberal but not low sodium intake. These results support the presence of gene-environment interactions between ACE genotypes and dietary sodium intake.</p>

<p>Previously, we demonstrated that recombinant Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vector rapidly and selectively transfers genes into cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), leaving endothelial cells (EC) unaffected. From this, we hypothesized that recombinant SFV in vivo only transfers genes into the media of balloon-injured but not intact vessel, that gene expression in VSMC is fast, and that the specificity of SFV for VSMC is caused by specific binding sites. To address these hypotheses, we studied the time course of in vivo SFV-LacZ and Ad-LacZ expression in balloon-injured rat aorta. In addition, the fusion characteristics of fluorescent pyrene-labeled SFV were explored in cultured VSMC and EC. In intact aorta, no LacZ expression was found in the intima or media at 24 h. In contrast, in denuded aorta, LacZ expression was detected in as early as 12 h after incubation. LacZ expression was predominantly present in the media. Ad-LacZ expression started after 12 h, but was predominantly present in the adventitia. Ad-LacZ expression in the media started after 72 h. In vitro transfection with SFV showed that fusion was higher and, moreover, saturable in VSMC as compared with EC, indicating the presence of specific SFV binding sites on VSMC, but not EC. From this we conclude that in vivo selectivity of SFV in balloon-injured vessels is based on the removal of the endothelium, which results in accessibility of VSMC in the media that carry specific binding sites for the SFV vector.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors provide renoprotection, but there is considerable interindividual variability in therapeutic efficacy, with residual proteinuria and progressive renal function loss in many individuals. This requires additional strategies to optimize therapy response, particularly for individuals with a poor response to ACE inhibition. We studied whether co-treatment with an angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist (AII-A) improves the individual antiproteinuric response of maximal ACE inhibition in established adriamycin nephrosis.METHODS: Rats were instituted on lisinopril (75 mg/L) six weeks after disease induction. After two weeks rats were re-stratified for residual proteinuria to continue this regimen, to a higher dose of lisinopril (150 mg/L) or to co-treatment with the AII-A L 158,809 for another four weeks. Groups on monotherapy AII-A and vehicle served as controls (all groups N=15).RESULTS: Lisinopril lowered proteinuria by 63% from 741 to 246 g/day (range of percentage change -90 to +2%). Neither increasing the dose of the ACE inhibitor nor addition of AII-A to ACE inhibition improved the antiproteinuric efficacy on a group or individual level: non-responders remained non-responders. All drug categories reduced hard end-points of focal glomerulosclerosis to a similar degree.CONCLUSIONS: ACE inhibition has variable renal protective efficacy in the adriamycin model. Neither increasing the dose of the ACE inhibitor beyond the optimal level nor co-treatment with AII-A overcome the individual therapy resistance. Thus, in established adriamycin nephrosis, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system at two different levels offers no additional benefit over ACE inhibition alone, either on the group or individual level.</p>

<p>Recent studies show that angiotensin II (AngII) can act from within the cell, possibly via intracellular receptors pharmacologically different from typical plasma membrane AngII receptors. The role of this intracellular AngII (AngIIi) is unclear. Besides direct effects of AngIIi on cellular processes one could hypothesise a possible role of AngIIi in modulation of cellular responses induced after heterologous receptor stimulation. We therefore examined if AngIIi influences [Ca+]i in A7r5 smooth muscle cells after serotonin (5HT) or UTP receptor stimulation. Application of AngIIi using liposomes, markedly inhibited 45Ca2+ influx after receptor stimulation with 5HT or UTP. This inhibition was reversible by intracellular administration of the AT1-antagonist losartan and not influenced by the AT2-antagonist PD123319. Similar results were obtained in single cell [Ca2+]i measurements, showing that AngIIi predominantly influences Ca2+ influx and not Ca2+ release via AT1-like receptors. It is concluded that AngIIi modulates signal transduction activated by heterologous receptor stimulation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To examine whether preoperative treatment with diltiazem could ameliorate left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized clinical study.SETTING: University hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four patients with preserved LV function undergoing elective CABG surgery.INTERVENTIONS: According to medical history, patients were divided into 2 groups: patients not receiving diltiazem (n = 17) and patients treated with once-daily oral diltiazem for at least 2 weeks (n = 17). All patients received preoperative beta-blockers.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After induction of anesthesia, after sternal closure, and 4 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral and pulmonary venous flow velocities were measured with pulsed Doppler. LV short-axis end-diastolic area by Doppler transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and hemodynamic variables were obtained simultaneously at comparable pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. Postoperatively, increased peak E and A velocities were observed in patients with diltiazem and controls and returned to baseline 4 hours post-CPB in controls. Changes in these velocities did not result in a decreased E/A ratio. Peak A velocity, E/A ratio, and E wave deceleration time were significantly dependent on heart rate, not peak E velocity. End-diastolic area at comparable pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remained unchanged. In relation to diltiazem, only peak A velocity and time velocity integral of the A wave (TVI-A) at 4 hours post-CPB differed from controls.CONCLUSION: Diastolic function is preserved after CABG surgery and is not altered by diltiazem in patients with preserved LV systolic function. The persistence of increased peak A velocity and TVI-A into the postoperative period suggests improved atrial systolic function with diltiazem.</p>

<p>Although the antiproteinuric response to antihypertensive treatment is the main predictor of renoprotective efficacy in long-term renal disease, to date, dose-finding studies of antihypertensives have been based only on blood pressure. We aimed to find the optimal antiproteinuric dose of the angiotensin II antagonist losartan. An open-label, dose-response study using subsequent 6-week treatment periods was performed in 10 nondiabetic patients with proteinuria of 5.8 +/- 0.8 g/d and a mean arterial pressure of 103 +/- 3.7 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication. All patients had normal to moderately impaired renal function. After the baseline period, five periods followed with a daily losartan dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 50 mg and a recovery without losartan. At the end of each period, proteinuria and mean arterial pressure were measured. The consecutive doses of losartan had a similar antihypertensive response (-11.3 +/- 2.8% by the 100-mg dose). The optimal antiproteinuric response was reached at 100 mg of losartan (-30 +/- 8%). The 50-mg dose (-13 +/- 7%) was less effective, and the 150-mg dose (-28 +/- 8%) was not more effective. A 100-mg dose of losartan is optimal for reduction of proteinuria in nondiabetic patients with nephrotic range proteinuria.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to determine whether patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and patients with paroxysmal AF show alterations in potassium channel expression.BACKGROUND: Persistent AF is associated with a sustained shortening of the atrial action potential duration and atrial refractory period. Underlying molecular changes have not been studied in humans. We investigated whether a changed gene expression of specific potassium channels is associated with these changes in patients with persistent AF and in patients with paroxysmal AF.METHODS: Right atrial appendages were obtained from 8 patients with paroxysmal AF, 10 with persistent AF and 18 matched controls in sinus rhythm. All controls underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, whereas most AF patients underwent Cox’s MAZE surgery (atrial arrhythmia surgery to cure AF) (n = 12). All patients had normal left ventricular function. mRNA (ribonucleic acid) levels were measured by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein content by Western blotting.RESULTS: mRNA levels of transient outward channel (Kv4.3), acetylcholine-dependent potassium channel (Kir3.4) and ATP-dependent potassium channel (Kir6.2) were reduced in patients with persistent AF (-35%, -47% and -36%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05), whereas only Kv4.3 mRNA level was reduced in patients with paroxysmal AF (-29%, p = 0.03). No changes were found for Kv1.5 and HERG mRNA levels in either group. Protein levels of Kv4.3, Kv1.5 and Kir3.1 were reduced both in patients with persistent AF (-39%, -84% and -47%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) and in those with paroxysmal AF (-57%, -64%, and -40%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Persistent AF is accompanied by reductions in mRNA and protein levels of several potassium channels. In patients with paroxysmal AF these reductions were observed predominantly at the protein level and not at the mRNA level, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Activation of the endothelin system is an important compensatory mechanism that is activated during left ventricular dysfunction. Whether this system plays a role at the atrial level during atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been examined in detail. The purpose of this study was to investigate mRNA and protein expression levels of the endothelin system in AF patients with and without concomitant underlying valve disease.METHODS AND RESULTS: Right atrial appendages of 36 patients with either paroxysmal or persistent AF were compared with 36 controls in sinus rhythm. The mRNA amounts of pro-endothelin-1 (pro-ET-1), endothelin receptor A (ET-A), and endothelin receptor B (ET-B) were studied by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. Protein amounts of the receptors were investigated by slot-blot analysis. mRNA amounts of pro-ET-1 were increased (+40%; P = 0.002) only in AF patients with underlying valve disease. ET-A and ET-B receptor protein amounts were significantly reduced in patients with paroxysmal AF (-39% and -47%, respectively) and persistent AF with underlying valve disease (-28% and -30%, respectively) and in persistent AF without valve disease (-20% and -40%, respectively). ET-A mRNA expression was unaltered in paroxysmal and persistent AF, whereas ET-B mRNA was reduced by 30% in persistent AF with (P &lt; 0.001) or without (P = 0.04) valve disease, but unchanged in paroxysmal AF.CONCLUSION: Substantial changes in gene expression of the endothelin system were observed in human atria during AF, especially in the presence of underlying valve disease. Alterations in endothelin expression associated with AF could play a role in the pathophysiology of AF and the progression of underlying heart disease.</p>

<p>Recent studies show that angiotensin II can act within the cell, possibly via intracellular receptors pharmacologically different from typical plasma membrane angiotensin II receptors. The signal transduction of intracellular angiotensin II is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of intracellular angiotensin II in cells devoid of physiological responses to extracellular angiotensin II (A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells). Intracellular delivery of angiotensin II was obtained by using liposomes or cell permeabilisation. Intracellular angiotensin II stimulated Ca2+ influx, as measured by 45Ca2+ uptake and single-cell fluorimetry. This effect was insensitive to extracellular or intracellular addition of losartan (angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist) or PD123319 ((s)-1-(4-[dimethylamino]-3-methylphenyl)methyl-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylate) (angiotensin AT2 receptor antagonist). Intracellular angiotensin II stimulated inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,)P3) production and increased the size of the Ins(1,4,5,)P3 releasable 45Ca2+ pool in permeabilised cells, independent of losartan and PD123319. Small G-proteins did not participate in this process, as assessed by using GDPbetaS. Intracellular delivery of angiotensin I was unable to elicit any of the effects elicited by intracellular angiotensin II. We conclude from our intracellular angiotensin application experiments that angiotensin II modulates Ca2+ homeostasis even in the absence of extracellular actions. Pharmacological properties suggest the involvement of putative angiotensin non-AT1-/non-AT2 receptors.</p>

<li>We recently demonstrated that intracellular application of Angiotensin II (Angiotensin II(intr)) induces rat aorta contraction independent of plasma membrane Angiotensin II receptors. In this study we investigated the effects of Angiotensin II(intr) on cell growth in A7r5 smooth muscle cells. 2. DNA-synthesis was increased dose-dependently by liposomes filled with Angiotensin II as measured by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation at high (EC(50)=27+/-6 pM) and low (EC(50)=14+/-5 nM) affinity binding sites with increases in E(max) of 58+/-4 and 37+/-4% above quiescent cells, respectively. Cell growth was corroborated by an increase in cell number. 3. Extracellular Angiotensin II (10 pM - 10 microM) did not modify [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation. 4. Growth effects of Angiotensin II(intr) mediated via high affinity sites were inhibited by liposomes filled with 1 microM of the non-peptidergic antagonists losartan (AT(1)-receptor) or PD123319 (AT(2)-receptor) or with the peptidergic agonist CGP42112A (AT(2)-receptor). E(max) values were decreased to 30+/-3, 29+/-4 and 4+/-2%, respectively, without changes in EC(50). The Angiotensin II(intr) effect via low affinity sites was only antagonized by CGP42112A (E(max)=11+/-3%), while losartan and PD123319 increased E(max) to 69+/-4%. Intracellular applications were ineffective in the absence of Angiotensin II(intr). 5. Neither intracellular nor extracellular Angiotensin I (1 microM) were effective. 6. The Angiotensin II(intr) induced growth response was blocked by selective inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) by wortmannin (1 microM) and of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway by PD98059 (1 microM) to 61+/-14 and 4+/-8% of control, respectively. 7. These data demonstrate that Angiotensin II(intr) induces cell growth through atypical AT-receptors via a PI-3K and MAPK/ERK -sensitive pathway.</li>

<p>BACKGROUND: We investigated changes in genetic expression of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in patients with stable mild to moderate chronic heart failure (CHF), since data on this topic were primarily obtained in end-stage CHF.METHODS: We studied tissue from 25 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II (n=12) and III-IV (n=13). Myocardial tissue from normal hearts (n=10) served as controls. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of ANP, BNP, and SERCA was isolated, and correlated with severity of CHF, left ventricular function (LVEF), peak oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)), and wedge pressure.RESULTS: A significant trend for gradual changes in mRNA expression according to increasing NYHA class was found for ANP, BNP (P&lt;0.0001) and SERCA (P=0.04), with a marked increase in patients with more advanced CHF (ANP and BNP: P&lt;0.01 vs. controls; SERCA: NS) and less pronounced changes in patients with mild CHF. mRNA of ANP and BNP correlated strongly with LVEF (-0.621 and -0.621, respectively, both P&lt;0.01) and peak VO(2) (-0.625 and -0.555, respectively, both P&lt;0.01) and, to a lesser extent, with wedge pressure (0.440 and 0.488, respectively, both P&lt;0.05). SERCA correlated most strongly with wedge pressure (-0.623, P&lt;0.01), and weak, non-significant correlations with LVEF and peak VO(2) were found.CONCLUSIONS: Genetic expression of ANP, BNP, and SERCA is progressively altered in proportion to the severity of CHF, although this is more marked for ANP and to a lesser extent BNP, than for SERCA. These changes support the concept that already early in CHF, genetic expression is affected, which has implications for the understanding of the pathophysiology of CHF.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R A1166C) gene polymorphism interact to increase the risk of ischaemic events, and whether this can be explained by the progression of angiographically defined coronary atherosclerosis.DESIGN: Prospective defined substudy of the lipid lowering regression trial (REGRESS).SETTING: University hospital.PATIENTS: 885 male patients with stable coronary artery disease.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of ischaemic events during a two year follow up; serial quantitative coronary arteriography (mean segment diameter and minimum obstruction diameter) at baseline and after two years.RESULTS: Patients who carried both the ACE-DD and AT(1)R-CC genotype had significantly more ischaemic events during the two year follow up than those carrying other genotype combinations (p = 0.035, Mantel-Haenszel test for linear association). There was no association between the two genotypes and mean segment diameter or minimum obstruction diameter at baseline or after two years.CONCLUSIONS: The suggestion that ACE-DD and AT(1)R-CC genotypes interact to increase the risk of ischaemic events is confirmed. However, this increased risk was not accompanied by increased progression of angiographically defined coronary atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Sustained shortening of the atrial effective refractory period (AERP), probably due to reduction in the L-type calcium current, is a major factor in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated underlying molecular changes by studying the relation between gene expression of the L-type calcium channel and potassium channels and AERP in patients with AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: mRNA and protein expression were determined in the left and right atrial appendages of patients with paroxysmal (n=13) or persistent (n=16) AF and of 13 controls in sinus rhythm using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and slot-blot, respectively. The mRNA content of almost all investigated ion channel genes was reduced in persistent but not in paroxysmal AF. Protein levels for the L-type Ca(2+) channel and 5 potassium channels (Kv4.3, Kv1.5, HERG, minK, and Kir3.1) were significantly reduced in both persistent and paroxysmal AF. Furthermore, AERPs were determined intraoperatively at 5 basic cycle lengths between 250 and 600 ms. Patients with persistent and paroxysmal AF displayed significant shorter AERPs. Protein levels of all ion channels investigated correlated positively with the AERP and with the rate adaptation of AERP. Patients with reduced ion channel protein expression had a shorter AERP duration and poorer rate adaptation.CONCLUSIONS: AF is predominantly accompanied by decreased protein contents of the L-type Ca(2+) channel and several potassium channels. Reductions in L-type Ca(2+) channel correlated with AERP and rate adaptation, and they represent a probable explanation for the electrophysiological changes during AF.</p>

<p>Muscle formation and postnatal growth is under the control of the muscle regulatory factors (MRF) gene family, consisting of four genes: MyoD1, myogenin, myf-5, and myf-6. Muscle mass is also known to be affected by specific drugs, like glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids have also been characterized as muscle atrophying agents. However, glucocorticoids are also the only drugs reported to have a beneficial effect on the treatment of muscle degenerative disorders. Since muscle mass relates to gender, this may be partially caused by gender. The aim of this study is to investigate gender-related basal and dexamethasone-induced expression of the MRF genes. Gender-specific MRF mRNA levels were investigated in anterior tibial muscles of the rat. Myogenin, myf-5, and myf-6 mRNA level was significantly higher in female rats than in male rats. Since muscle mass is usually higher in males, we conclude that the development of gender-related differences in muscle mass is not primarily under the control of the mRNA levels of the MRF genes. Male rats treated with dexamethasone for 14 days (1 mg per kg body weight) showed increased levels of MyoD1, myogenin and myf-5 compared to control male rats. Female rats treated with dexamethasone showed decreased expression of myf-6 compared to control female rats. These results suggest that dexamethasone increase satellite cell-specific MRF activity in male muscle tissue, which is suggested to be associated with muscle hypertrophy, while maintenance of muscle tissue is affected in female muscle tissue. Therefore, we conclude that both basal and dexamethasone-induced MRF gene mRNA levels are regulated gender-specific.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) results in an impairment of atrial function. In order to elucidate the mechanism behind this phenomenon, we investigated the gene expression of proteins influencing calcium handling.METHODS: Right atrial appendages were obtained from eight patients with paroxysmal AF, ten with persistent AF (&gt; 8 months) and 18 matched controls in sinus rhythm. All controls underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, whereas most AF patients underwent Cox’s MAZE surgery (n = 12). All patients had a normal left ventricular function. Total RNA was isolated and reversely transcribed into cDNA. In a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction the cDNA of interest and of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were coamplified and separated by ethidium bromide-stained gel electrophoresis. Slot blot analysis was performed to study protein expression.RESULTS: L-type calcium channel alpha 1 and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA (-57%, p = 0.01 and -28%, p = 0.04, respectively) and protein contents (-43%, p = 0.02 and -28%, p = 0.04, respectively) were reduced in patients with persistent AF compared to the controls. mRNA contents of phospholamban, ryanodine receptor type 2 and sodium/calcium exchanger were comparable. No changes were observed in patients with paroxysmal AF.CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in gene expression of proteins involved in the calcium homeostasis occur only in patients with long-term persistent AF. In the absence of underlying heart disease, the changes are rather secondary than primary to AF.</p>

<p>The renin-angiotensin system is important for cardiovascular homeostasis. Currently, therapies for different cardiovascular diseases are based on inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or angiotensin II receptor blockade. Inhibition of ACE blocks metabolism of angiotensin-(1-7) to angiotensin-(1-5) and can lead to elevation of angiotensin-(1-7) levels in plasma and tissue. In animal models, angiotensin-(1-7) itself causes or enhances vasodilation and inhibits vascular contractions to angiotensin II. The function of angiotensin-(1-5) is unknown. We investigated whether angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(1-5) inhibit ACE or antagonize angiotensin-induced vasoconstrictions in humans. ACE activity in plasma and atrial tissue was inhibited by angiotensin-(1-7) up to 100%, with an IC(50) of 3.0 and 4.0 micromol/L, respectively. In human internal mammary arteries, contractions induced by angiotensin I and II and the non-ACE-specific substrate [Pro(11),D-Ala(12)]-angiotensin I were antagonized by angiotensin-(1-7) (10(-5) mol/L) in a noncompetitive way, with a 60% inhibition of the maximal response to angiotensin II. Contractions to ACE-specific substrate [Pro(10)]-angiotensin I were also inhibited, an effect only partly accounted for by antagonism of angiotensin II. Angiotensin-(1-5) inhibited plasma ACE activity with a potency equal to that of angiotensin I but had no effect on arterial contractions. In conclusion, angiotensin-(1-7) blocks angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and inhibits ACE in human cardiovascular tissues. Angiotensin-(1-5) only inhibits ACE. These results show that angiotensin-(1-7) may be an important modulator of the human renin-angiotensin system.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Circulating cardiac natriuretic peptides play an important role in maintaining volume homeostasis, especially during conditions affecting hemodynamics. During atrial fibrillation (AF), levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) becomes elevated. The aim of this study was to gather information about gene expression of the natriuretic peptide system on the atrial level in patients with AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Right atrial appendages of 36 patients with either paroxysmal or persistent AF were compared with 36 case matched controls in sinus rhythm for mRNA expression of pro- atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), and their natriuretic peptide receptor type-A (NPR-A). We investigated patients without (n = 36) and with (n = 36) valvular disease. Persistent AF was associated with higher mRNA expression of pro-BNP (+66%, P = 0.04, in patients without valvular disease, and +69%, P &lt; 0.01, in patients with valvular disease) and lower mRNA expression of NPR-A (-58%, P = 0.02, in patients without valvular disease, and -62 %, P &lt; 0.01, in patients with valvular disease). The mRNA content of pro-ANP was only increased in patients with valvular disease (+12%, P = 0.03). No changes were observed in patients with paroxysmal AF.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that persistent, but not paroxysmal, AF induces alterations in gene expression of pro-BNP and NPR-A on the atrial level. Although AF generally is associated with an increase of plasma ANP level, a change in mRNA content of pro-ANP is only observed in the presence of concomitant valvular disease and is of minor magnitude.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) leads to a loss of atrial contraction within hours to days. During persistence of AF, cellular dedifferentiation and hypertrophy occur, eventually resulting in degenerative changes and cell death. Abnormalities in the calcium handling in response to tachycardia-induced intracellular calcium overload play a pivotal role in these processes.METHODS AND RESULTS: The purpose was to investigate the mRNA expression of proteins and ion channels influencing the calcium handling in patients with persistent AF. Right atrial appendages were obtained from 18 matched controls in sinus rhythm (group 1) and 18 patients with persistent AF undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Previous duration of AF was &lt; or = 6 months in 9 (group 2) and &gt; 6 months in 9 patients (group 3). In a single semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA of interest and of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, were coamplified and separated by gel electrophoresis. L-type calcium channel alpha1 subunit mRNA content was inversely related to the duration of AF: -26% in group 2 compared to group 1 (P = 0.2), and -49% in group 3 compared to group 1 (P = 0.01). Inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein ialpha2 mRNA content was reduced in group 3 compared to group 1 (-30%, P = 0.01). Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, phospholamban and sodium-calcium exchanger mRNA contents were not affected by AF.CONCLUSIONS: AF-induced alterations in mRNA contents of proteins and ion channels involved in the calcium handling seem to occur in relation to the previous duration of AF. In the present patient population, these changes were significant only if AF lasted &gt; 6 months.</p>

<p>Prolonged stimulation of rat A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cells with 3 microM vasopressin, or of hamster DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells with 10 microM bradykinin or 100 microM histamine led within 4 h to a 40-50% down-regulation of the type 1 InsP3 receptor (InsP3R-1) and of the type 3 InsP3 receptor (InsP3R-3). InsP3R down-regulation was a cell- and agonist-specific process, since several other agonists acting on PLC-coupled receptors did not change the expression level of the InsP3R isoforms in these cell types and since no agonist-induced down-regulation of InsP3Rs was observed in HeLa cells. Down-regulation of InsP3Rs was prevented by an inhibitor of proteasomal protease activity, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN). The Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (2 microM) also induced InsP3R-1 down-regulation (43%) in A7r5 cells, which was inhibited by ALLN. In A7r5 cells transiently transfected with a cDNA construct, bearing a luciferase coding sequence under control of the rat InsP3R-1 promoter, reduced luciferase activity could be demonstrated upon stimulation of cells with vasopressin or verapamil. Thus, besides enhanced protein degradation, a reduction of InsP3R promoter activity might contribute to the down-regulation of InsP3Rs in A7r5 cells. We next investigated the effect of InsP3R down-regulation on Ca2+ responses in A7r5 cells. A rightward shift in the dose-response curve for InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was observed in permeabilized monolayers of vasopressin-pretreated A7r5 cells (EC50 630 nM and 400 nM for pretreated and non-pretreated cells, respectively). The Ca2+ responses to threshold doses of vasopressin were markedly reduced in intact vasopressin-pretreated cells. We conclude that prolonged agonist-exposure leads to down-regulation of InsP3Rs in A7r5 and DDT, MF-2 smooth muscle cells. The mechanism of down-regulation likely involves proteasomal degradation and reduction of InsP3R promoter activity. Moreover, down-regulation of InsP3Rs resulted in desensitization of Ca2+ release from InsP3 sensitive stores.</p>

<p>In humans, at least three types of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) are present. The gene encoding type 1 IP3R (IP3R-I) is expressed in all cell types, although expression predominates in Purkinje cells. To study the regulation of the human IP3R-I gene, we isolated and characterized a 2.1-kb 5’ flanking region. In transient expression assays using a rat cell line, analysis of various deletion mutants demonstrated that a fragment of only 86 bp 5’ of the putative tsp displayed a promoter activity similar to that of the 2.1-kb fragment. Also, we compared the sequence of the human IP3R-I promoter with the sequence of the mouse IP3R-I promoter. Considerable sequence homology is present in four distinct domains, which include several conserved putative binding sites for transcription factors. Further, we demonstrate a decrease in the activity of the isolated human IP3R-I promoter and of the endogenous IP3R-I promoter after 48 h of treatment with retinoic acid. Analysis of deletion constructs of the human promoter indicates that the decreased promoter activity in response to retinoic acid is likely to be mediated by a conserved AP-2 binding site.</p>

<p>Previous reports suggested the expression of four or five different Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor [Ins(1,4,5)P3R] isoforms in mouse cells [Ross, Danoff, Schell, Snyder and Ullrich (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 4265-4269; De Smedt, Missiaen, Parys, Bootman, Mertens, Van Den Bosch and Casteels (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21691-21698]. To explore this diversity further, we have isolated and sequenced partial clones of two Ins(1,4,5)P3R mRNAs from the mouse embryonic C3H10T1/2 cell line. These clones showed between 94.2 and 94.9% sequence identity with the corresponding rat Ins(1,4,5)P3R-II and Ins(1,4,5)P3R-III isoforms. Based on these newly obtained sequences we have determined the relative expression of the different Ins(1,4,5)P3R mRNAs in cultured cells and in animal tissues of mouse origin by a ratio reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Ins(1,4,5)P3R-I was very prominent in brain and cerebellum and Ins(1,4,5)P3R-II in epithelia such as kidney as well as in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Ins(1,4,5)P3R-III was highly expressed in all cultured cell types and in tissues with high cell turnover, e.g. testis. The prominent expression of Ins(1,4,5)P3R-I and Ins(1,4,5)P3R-III in A7r5 and C3H10T1/2 cells respectively was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and was compatible with a lower threshold for Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release in the former cell type. Screening of a large number of mouse cell lines and tissues revealed the presence of Ins(1,4,5)P3R-I as well as of the Ins(1,4,5)P3R-II and Ins(1,4,5)P3R-III isoforms which were identified in the present study, but in contrast with previous reports there was no evidence for more isoform diversity.</p>

<p>The P2 purinoceptor antagonist suramin reverses skeletal muscle paralysis evoked by non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents in vitro and in vivo. To further study the action of suramin on neuromuscular transmission, (miniature) endplate potentials ((m.)e.p.ps), motor nerve terminal currents and the release of radiolabeled acetylcholine was measured in isolated nerve-muscle preparations. In preparations paralysed by low Ca2+/high Mg2+ conditions, suramin (10 microM-1 mM) induced a concentration-dependent decrease in quantal content of the e.p.ps without affecting m.e.p.ps. Suramin reversed neuromuscular block by d-tubocurarine in these preparations. In erabutoxin paralysed preparations, suramin (40 microM-1 mM) inhibited the motor nerve terminal currents related to Ca2+ influx concentration-dependently, but did not affect Na+ currents. Suramin-induced inhibition of Ca2+ currents was not antagonized by ATP gamma S. Suramin (300 microM) reduced [14C]acetylcholine outflow in non-paralysed rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations by 32%. As suramin did not chelate Ca2+, these results indicate that suramin inhibits neuromuscular transmission by blocking prejunctional Ca2+ channels, thereby decreasing acetylcholine release upon nerve stimulation.</p>

<li>The increase in intracellular CA2+ on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation, P2U-purinoceptor stimulation and K(+)-induced depolarization was investigated in mouse C2C12 myotubes by use of fura-2 fluorescence to characterize the intracellular organisation of Ca2+ releasing stores and Ca(2+)-entry process. 2. Stimulation of nAChRs with carbachol induced a rapid rise in internal Ca2+ (EC50 = 0.85 +/- 0.09 microM), followed by a sustained phase. The Ca2+ response evoked by carbachol (10 microM) was completely blocked by the nAChR antagonist, pancuronium (3 microM), but was not affected by the muscarinic antagonist, atropine (3 microM), or under conditions when Ca2+ entry was blocked by La3+ (50 microM) or diltiazem (10 microM). Addition of pancuronium (3 microM) during the sustained phase of the carbachol-evoked response did not affect this phase. 3. Stimulation of P2U purinoceptors with ATP (1 mM) induced a somewhat higher biphasic Ca2+ response (EC50 of the rapid phase: 8.72 +/- 0.08 microM) than with carbachol. Pretreatment with La3+ abolished the sustained phase of the ATP-induced Ca2+ response, while the response was unaffected by diltiazem or pancuronium. 4. Stimulation of the cells with high K+ (60 mM), producing the same depolarization as with carbachol (10 microM), induced a rapid monophasic Ca2+ response, insensitive to diltiazem, pancuronium or La3+. 5. Under Ca(2+)-free conditions, the sustained phase of the carbachol- and ATP-evoked responses were abolished. Pre-emptying of depolarization-sensitive stores by high K+ under Ca(2+)-free conditions did not affect the carbachol- or ATP-evoked Ca2+ mobilization and vice versa. Preincubation of the cells with ATP in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ decreased the amplitude of the subsequent carbachol-induced Ca2+ response to 11%, while in the reverse procedure the ATP-induced response was decreased to 65%. Ca2+ mobilization evoked by simultaneous addition of optimal concentrations of carbachol and ATP was increased compared to levels obtained with either agonist. 6. Preincubation with high K+ under normal conditions abolished the sustained phase of the ATP-evoked Ca2+ response. The carbachol response consisted only of the sustained phase in the presence of high K+. 7. The carbachol-induced Ca2+ response was completely abolished under low Na+/Ca(2+)-free conditions, while under low Na+ conditions only a sustained Ca2+ response was observed. The ATP- and K(+)-induced responses were changed compared to Ca(2+)-free conditions. 8. ATP (300 microM) induced the formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 under Ca(2+)-free conditions with a comparable time course to that found for the rise in internal Ca2+. In contrast to ATP, carbachol (10 microM) did not affect Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels under Ca(2+)-free conditions. 9. It is concluded that the Ca2+ release from discrete stores of C2C12 myotubes is induced by stimulation of nAChRs, P2U-purinoceptors and by high K+. Only the P2U-purinoceptor and nAChR activated stores show considerable overlap in releasable Ca2+. Sustained Ca(2+)-entry is activated by stimulation of nAChRs and P2U-purinoceptors via separate ion-channels, which are different from the skeletal muscle nAChR-coupled cation-channel.</li>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular instability after intravenous induction of anesthesia may be explained partly by direct negative inotropic effects. The direct inotropic influence of etomidate, ketamine, midazolam, propofol, and thiopental on the contractility of isolated human atrial tissue was determined. Effective concentrations were compared with those reported clinically.METHODS: Atrial tissue was obtained from 16 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Each fragment was divided into three strips, and one anesthetic was tested per strip in increasing concentrations (10(-6) to 10(-2) M). Strips were stimulated at 0.5 Hz, and maximum isometric force was measured. Induction agents were studied in two groups, group 1 (n = 7) containing thiopental, midazolam, and propofol, and group 2 (n = 9) consisting of etomidate, ketamine, and propofol.RESULTS: The tested anesthetics caused a concentration-dependent depression of contractility resulting in complete cessation of contractions at the highest concentrations. The IC50s (mean +/- SEM; microM) for inhibition of the contractility were: thiopental 43 +/- 7.6, propofol 235 +/- 48 (group 1), and 246 +/- 42 (group 2), midazolam 145 +/- 54, etomidate 133 +/- 13, and ketamine 303 +/- 54.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating a concentration-dependent negative inotropic effect of intravenous anesthetics in isolated human atrial muscle. No inhibition of myocardial contractility was found in the clinical concentration ranges of propofol, midazolam, and etomidate. In contrast, thiopental showed strong and ketamine showed slight negative inotropic properties. Thus, negative inotropic effects may explain in part the cardiovascular depression on induction of anesthesia with thiopental but not with propofol, midazolam, and etomidate. Improvement of hemodynamics after induction of anesthesia with ketamine cannot be explained by intrinsic cardiac stimulation.</p>

<p>Irrational prescribing is a habit which is difficult to cure. However, prevention is possible and for this reason the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs aims to improve the teaching of pharmacotherapy to medical students. The impact of a short problem-based training course in pharmacotherapy, using a WHO manual on the principles of rational prescribing, was measured in an international multi-centre randomised controlled study of 219 undergraduate medical students in Groningen (Netherlands), Kathmandu (Nepal), Lagos (Nigeria), Newcastle (Australia), New Delhi (India), San Francisco (USA), and Yogyakarta (Japan). The manual and the course presented the students, who were about to enter the clinical phase of their studies, with a normative model for pharmacotherapeutic reasoning in which they were taught to generate a “standard” pharmacotherapeutic approach to common disorders, resulting in a set of first-choice drugs called P(ersonal)-drugs. The students were then taught how to apply this set of P-drugs to specific patient problems on the symptomatic treatment of pain, using a six-step problem-solving routine. The impact of the course was measured by tests before training, immediately after, and six months later. After the course, students from the study group performed significantly better than controls in all patient problems presented (p &lt; 0.05). The students not only remembered how to solve old problems, but they could also apply their skills to new problems. Both retention and transfer effect were maintained at least six months after the training session in all seven medical schools. In view of the impossibility of teaching students all basic knowledge on the thousands of drugs available, this approach seems to be an efficient way of teaching rational prescribing. However, the method should be accompanied by a change in teaching methods away from the habit of transferring knowledge about the drugs towards problem-based teaching of therapeutic reasoning.</p>

<p>Three days of treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (1 nM-1 microM) induced a concentration-dependent up-regulation of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in C2C12 mouse myotubes (EC50 = 10 +/- 7.3 nM), as assessed by [3H]alpha-BuTx binding. The maximum increase in binding amounted 148 +/- 17.6% of control. Parallel electrophysiological measurements employed the patch-clamp technique in cell-attached configuration. The nAChR single channel properties were investigated in the presence of carbachol (1 microM) in the pipette. Treatment with dexamethasone (1 microM, 1-5 days) induced an increase in the number of patches showing channel activity from 30 to 70%. Ion channel characteristics did not differ significantly in control and dexamethasone treated myotubes. Conductance was 32 +/- 3 vs 31 +/- 2 pS, respectively. The time constants of open time events tau 1 and tau 2 were 0.6 +/- 0.1 and 6.6 +/- 1 ms vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 and 6.6 +/- 1 ms, respectively. Closed duration’s tau 1 and tau 2 were 1.1 +/- 0.2 and 110 +/- 12 ms vs 1.2 +/- 0.3 and 107 +/- 18 ms. In conclusion, dexamethasone upregulated nAChRs are functional and their electrophysiological parameters are similar to those found in control myotubes.</p>

<p>Since the role of intrinsic inactivation of the receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in the phenomenon of quantal release of Ca2+ is still a point of debate, we investigated whether inactivation of the InsP3 receptor can be responsible for quantal release in permeabilized A7r5 cells. A crucial experiment was that a second challenge of the cells with a low dose of InsP3, after washing out the first challenge, was unable to produce a renewed phasic response under conditions where the Ca2+ pumps were blocked. A new phasic response was however obtained with either addition of a higher dose of InsP3 or after allowing the refilling of the Ca2+ stores. We conclude therefore that quantal Ca2+ release in A7r5 cells is not due to InsP3 receptor inactivation.</p>

<li>To investigate the role of long-term stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the regulation of membrane potential, non-contracting C2C12 myotubes were stimulated for 1-4 days with carbachol (10 microM) and membrane potentials were measured by the intracellular microelectrode technique after washing out of the drug. 2. The membrane potential (-45.7 mV) gradually increased by 10.1 mV to -55.8 mV during 4 days treatment, which was caused by enhanced electrogenic Na+/K(+)-pumping. 3. The concentration-dependent enhancement of Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity in long-term carbachol-treated myotubes (4 days, EC50 = 5.3 microM) was prevented by co-treatment with the competitive nicotinic AChR antagonist, pancuronium but not by the muscarinic antagonist, atropine. 4. Enhanced Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity still developed in carbachol-stimulated myotubes during co-treatment (4 days) with the nicotinic AChR-channel blocker, chlorpromazine (1 microM). Membrane depolarization as such, obtained by incubation in high K+ medium (40 mM, 4 days) did not enhance Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity. 5. Non-treated myotubes possessed a high-affinity ouabain binding site (Kd = 119 nM) in association with the low Na+/K(+)-pumping activity. Long-term stimulation of myotubes (4 days) with carbachol or with a combination of carbachol and chlorpromazine was accompanied by the development of an additional low-affinity ouabain binding site (Kd = 13 microM). 6. Binding of monoclonal antibodies directed against either alpha 1- or alpha 2-subunit of Na+/K(+)-ATPase were both increased in myotubes treated with carbachol (4 days). 7. These results support the concept that nicotinic AChRs regulate Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity, independent of the functionality of the receptor-operated ion-channel.</li>

<li>The presence of a nucleotide receptor and a discrete ATP-sensitive receptor on C2C12 myotubes has been shown by electrophysiological experiments. In this study, the ATP-sensitive receptors of C2C12 myotubes were further characterized by measuring the formation of inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and internal Ca2+. 2. The nucleotides ATP and UTP caused a concentration-dependent increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 content with comparable time courses (EC50: ATP 33 +/- 2 microM, UTP 80 +/- 4 microM). ADP was less effective in increasing Ins(1,4,5)P3 content of the cells, while selective agonists for P1-, P2X- and P2Y-purinoceptors, adenosine, alpha,beta-methylene ATP and 2-methylthio ATP, appeared to be ineffective. 3. Under Ca(2+)-free conditions, the basal level of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was lower than in the presence of Ca2+, and the ATP- and UTP-induced formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was diminished. 4. The Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation induced by optimal ATP and UTP concentrations was not additive. ATP- and UTP-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation showed cross-desensitization, whereas cross-desensitization was absent in responses elicited by one of the nucleotides and bradykinin. 5. The change in Ins(1,4,5)P3 content induced by effective nucleotides was inhibited by suramin. Schild plots for suramin inhibition of Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation in ATP- and UTP-stimulated myotubes showed slopes greater than unity (1.63 +/- 0.09 and 1.37 +/- 0.11, respectively). Apparent pA2 values were 4.50 +/- 0.48 and 4.41 +/- 0.63 for ATP and UTP, respectively. 6. Stimulation of the cells with ATP or UTP induced a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+, followed by a slow decline to basal levels. Ca2+ responses reached lower maximal values and did not show the slow phase in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The ATP and UTP-evoked increase in intracellular Ca2+ was not additive and showed cross-desensitization. Cross-desensitization was absent in myotubes stimulated with one of the nucleotides and bradykinin.7. These results show that ATP- and UTP-induced formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+-influx from the extracellular space are mediated exclusively via the nucleotide type P2-purinoceptor in mouse C2C12 myotubes.</li>

<p>We have studied the neuromuscular effects of a 48-h infusion of high-dose pancuronium (400 micrograms kg-1 h-1) in four cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, using contraction of tibialis anterior muscles after direct and indirect stimulation. After cessation of the pancuronium infusion, prolonged paralysis existed. The first twitch in the train-of-four stimuli (TOF) reappeared 8-12 h after termination of the pancuronium infusion. Twenty-four hours after termination of the infusion, TOF ratios were less than 0.08 and twitch contraction averaged 39 (SE 8)% of initial values. Twitch contraction after direct stimulation did not differ from initial values. Antagonism of paralysis was accomplished with neostigmine 60 micrograms kg-1 in two animals and neostigmine 90 micrograms kg-1 and 4-aminopyridine 500 micrograms kg-1 in the others. Steady-state plasma concentration of pancuronium (2000 ng ml-1) decreased rapidly after termination of the infusion, but then stabilized at about 130 ng ml-1. These results indicate that prolonged paralysis after long-term administration of high-dose pancuronium is caused primarily by failure of neuromuscular transmission, most likely caused by the persistent plasma concentrations of the drug in the pharmacologically active range.</p>

<li>The formation of adenosine 3’:5’-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), induced by ATP and other nucleotides was investigated in mouse C2C12 myotubes. 2. ATP (100 microM) and ATP gamma S (100 microM) caused a sustained increase in cyclic AMP content of the cells, reaching a maximum after 10 min. The cyclic AMP content reached a maximum in the presence of 100 microM ATP, followed by a decline at higher ATP concentrations. ATP-induced cyclic AMP formation was inhibited by the P2-purinoceptor antagonist, suramin. 3. Myotubes hydrolysed ATP to ADP at a rate of 9.7 +/- 1.0 nmol mg-1 protein min-1. However, further hydrolysis of ADP to AMP and adenosine was negligible. 4. The cyclic AMP formation induced by ADP (10 microM-1 mM) showed similar characteristics to that induced by ATP, but a less pronounced decline was observed than with ATP. ADP-induced cyclic AMP formation was blocked by suramin, while cyclic AMP formation elicited by adenosine (10 microM-1 mM) was insensitive to suramin. 5. The ATP analogue, alpha,beta-methylene-ATP also induced a suramin-sensitive cyclic AMP formation, while 2-methylthio-ATP and the pyrimidine, UTP, did not affect cyclic AMP levels. 6. Stimulation of the myotubes with ATP or UTP (10 microM-1 mM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the Ins(1,4,5)P3 content of the cells. ADP (100 microM-1 mM) was less effective. Adenosine did not affect Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels. 7. Incubation of the cells with UTP (30 microM- 1 mM) inhibited the ATP- and ADP-induced cyclic AMP formation, suggesting that stimulation of the ‘nucleotide’ type P2-receptor inhibits P2-purinoceptor mediated cyclic AMP formation in C2C12 myotubes. In contrast, UTP (30 microM-I mM) enhanced adenosine-induced cyclic AMP formation.8. Adenosine-sensitive P1-purinoceptors activating cyclic AMP formation were found in C2C12 myotubes.Further, a novel P2-purinoceptor is postulated, sensitive to ATP, ADP and ATPgammaS, which also activates the formation of cyclic AMP in C2C12 myotubes.</li>

<li>Rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone and maximal twitches of a tibialis anterior muscle were evoked by stimulation of the motor nerve. 2. Suramin, injected intravenously in a series of cumulative bolus doses, each 15 mg kg-1, completely reversed a 90% depression of twitches maintained by a continuous intravenous infusion of pancuronium. The cumulated dose necessary to restore twitches to 50% of their control amplitude was 35 mg kg-1. Suramin did not modify a similar degree of block produced by suxamethonium, nor did it affect the amplitude of control maximal twitches, even in cumulative doses up to 150 mg kg-1. 3. The effects of bolus doses of suramin (85 mg kg-1), neostigmine (0.03 mg kg-1) and 4-aminopyridine (1.2 mg kg-1), calculated to restore pancuronium-blocked twitches to 95% of control amplitude, were compared. Suramin produced the most rapid reversal (1.1 +/- 0.5 min), but its duration of action was the shortest (9.4 +/- 1.6 min). Suramin was without effect on heart rate or blood pressure in the doses used. 4. The results showed that suramin reversed neuromuscular block produced by nondepolarizing blocking drug, pancuronium, but was without effect on a block produced by the depolarizing blocking drug, suxamethonium. Its short duration of action suggests that suramin would probably not be of value clinically as a reversal agent. However, it is possible that it might serve as a starter compound for the synthesis and development of a new class of reversal agents for use in anaesthetic practice.</li>

The hyperpolarization was not observed in the absence of external calcium, and was abolished in the presence of tetraethylammonium (20 mM) or the bee toxin, apamin (0.1 microM). The depolarization was reduced under low sodium conditions. 4. A biphasic change in membrane potential was also recorded in the presence of adenosine 5’-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S) and the pyrimidine uridine triphosphate (UTP), while the ATP derivatives and analogues, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine, alpha,beta-methylene ATP and 2-methylthio ATP and the nucleotides, guanosine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate, did not affect the membrane potential of the myotubes. 5. The hyperpolarization elicited by ATP gamma S or UTP was also blocked by apamin and abolished under Ca(2+)-free conditions. 6. In contrast to ATP and ATP gamma S, the depolarization evoked by UTP was unaffected under low Na+ and less sensitive to the antagonistic action of suramin. 7.

ATP elicited a depolarization if applied after UTP, while UTP did not change membrane potential following the application of ATP. 8.

<p>Unexpectedly, it was observed that the P2-purinoceptor antagonist, suramin (10 microM to 1 mM), reversed the muscle paralysis caused by structurally unrelated non-depolarizing relaxants. Suramin competitively reversed the blocking action of pancuronium. Both the pre- and postsynaptic blockade of nicotinic receptors by pancuronium was counteracted, as shown by the action of suramin, using train-of-four stimulation. Suramin did not affect the paralysis caused by the depolarizing relaxant, succinylcholine. The reversal action of suramin was not due to an increase in the acetylcholine concentration in the synaptic cleft, since neither the contraction of preparations partially paralysed by diminished acetylcholine release in the presence of low Ca2+ or high Mg2+ nor acetylcholinesterase activity were affected. Suramin did not affect the reduction in twitch tension caused by adenosine and potentiated the ATP-induced reduction in twitch, indicating that ATP-sensitive receptors are not involved in the reversal action of suramin. Consequently, these results suggest that the action of suramin is due to binding with a site on the acetylcholine receptor also occupied by non-depolarizing relaxants, but different from the site occupied by succinylcholine.</p>
