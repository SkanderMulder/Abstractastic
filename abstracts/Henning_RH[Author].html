<p>Gasotransmitters fulfill important roles in cellular homeostasis having been linked to various pathologies, including inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the known pathways mediating the actions of gasotransmitters, their effects in regulating mitochondrial function are emerging. Given that mitochondria are key organelles in energy production, formation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, they are important mediators in preserving health and disease. Preserving or restoring mitochondrial function by gasotransmitters may be beneficial, and mitigate pathogenetic processes. In this review we discuss the actions of gasotransmitters with focus on their role in mitochondrial function and their therapeutic potential.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.</p>

<h4>Converse role of class I and class IIa HDACs in the progression of atrial fibrillation.</h4>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common persistent clinical tachyarrhythmia, is associated with altered gene transcription which underlies cardiomyocyte dysfunction, AF susceptibility and progression. Recent research showed class I and class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) to regulate pathological and fetal gene expression, and thereby induce hypertrophy and cardiac contractile dysfunction. Whether class I and class IIa HDACs are involved in AF promotion is unknown. We aim to elucidate the role of class I and class IIa HDACs in tachypacing-induced contractile dysfunction in experimental model systems for AF and clinical AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Class I and IIa HDACs were overexpressed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes followed by calcium transient (CaT) measurements. Overexpression of class I HDACs, HDAC1 or HDAC3, significantly reduced CaT amplitude in control normal-paced (1<U+202F>Hz) cardiomyocytes, which was further reduced by tachypacing (5<U+202F>Hz) in HDAC3 overexpressing cardiomyocytes. HDAC3 inhibition by shRNA or by the specific inhibitor, RGFP966, prevented contractile dysfunction in both tachypaced HL-1 cardiomyocytes and Drosophila prepupae. Conversely, overexpression of class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 or HDAC9) did not affect CaT in controls, with HDAC5 and HDAC7 overexpression even protecting against tachypacing-induced CaT loss. Notably, the protective effect of HDAC5 and HDAC7 was abolished in cardiomyocytes overexpressing a dominant negative HDAC5 or HDAC7 mutant, bearing a mutation in the binding domain for myosin enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Furthermore, tachypacing induced phosphorylation of HDAC5 and promoted its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm, leading to up-regulation of MEF2-related fetal gene expression (ß-MHC, BNP). In accord, boosting nuclear localization of HDAC5 by MC1568 or Go6983 attenuated CaT loss in tachypaced HL-1 cardiomyocytes and preserved contractile function in Drosophila prepupae. Findings were expanded to clinical AF. Here, patients with AF showed a significant increase in expression levels and activity of HDAC3, phosphorylated HDAC5 and fetal genes (ß-MHC, BNP) in atrial tissue compared to controls in sinus rhythm. CONCLUSION: Class I and class IIa HDACs display converse roles in AF progression. Whereas overexpression of Class I HDAC3 induces cardiomyocyte dysfunction, class IIa HDAC5 overexpression reveals protective properties. Accordingly, HDAC3 inhibitors and HDAC5 nuclear boosters show protection from tachypacing-induced changes and therefore may represent interesting therapeutic options in clinical AF.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in kidney damage in various pathologies, including acute and chronic kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy. In addition to the well-studied ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, hypothermia/rewarming (H/R) also inflicts acute kidney injury. Substituted 6-hydroxychromanols are a novel class of mitochondrial medicines that ameliorate mitochondrial oxidative stress and protect the mitochondrial network. To identify a novel 6-hydroxychromanol that protects mitochondrial structure and function in the kidney during H/R, we screened multiple compounds in vitro and subsequently assessed the efficacy of the 6-hydroxychromanol derivatives SUL-109 and SUL-121 in vivo to protect against kidney injury after H/R in rats.</AbstractText>: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in kidney damage in various pathologies, including acute and chronic kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy.

Selected compounds (SUL-109, SUL-121) or vehicle were administered to ketamine-anaesthetized male Wistar rats (IV 135<U+2009>µg/kg/h) undergoing H/R at 15°C for 3<U+2009>h followed by rewarming and normothermia for 1<U+2009>h. Metabolic parameters and body temperature were measured throughout.

In vivo, H/R in rats showed kidney injury molecule 1 expression in the kidney and tubular dilation, accompanied by double-strand DNA breaks and protein nitrosylation. SUL-109 and SUL-121 ameliorated tubular kidney damage, preserved mitochondrial mass and maintained cortical adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) levels, although SUL-121 did not reduce protein nitrosylation.</AbstractText>: H/R injury in vitro lowered cell viability by 94<U+2009>±<U+2009>1%, which was counteracted dose-dependently by multiple 6-hydroxychomanols derivatives.

<p>BACKGROUND: Post-transplant tuberculosis (PTTB) is a serious opportunistic infection in renal graft recipients with a 30-70 fold higher incidence compared to the general population. PTTB occurs most frequently within the first years after transplantation, manifesting as pulmonary or disseminated TB. Gastrointestinal TB (GITB) is a rare and potentially lethal manifestation of PTTB and may show delayed onset in renal transplant recipients due to the use of lower doses of immunosuppressants. Further, non-specificity of symptoms and the common occurrence of GI disorders in transplant recipients may delay diagnosis of GITB.CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a rare survival case of isolated GITB in a renal transplant recipient, occurring seven years after transplantation. The patient’s condition was complicated by severe sepsis with positive blood culture Staphylococcus haemolyticus, septic shock, multiple organ failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute renal failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor circulatory support and intermittent hemodialysis. Furthermore, nosocomial infections such as invasive aspergillosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred during hospitalization. Antituberculosis therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) was initiated upon Mycobacterium confirmation. Moreover, treatment with voriconazole due to the Aspergillus flavus and meropenem due to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was initiated, the former necessitating discontinuation of rifampicin. After 34 days, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and was discharged to the pulmonary ward, followed by complete recovery.CONCLUSION: This case offers a guideline for the clinical management towards survival of GITB in transplant patients, complicated by septic shock and multiple organ failure, including acute renal injury and ARDS.</p>

<p>Hibernators show superior resistance to ischemia and hypothermia, also outside the hibernation season. Therefore, hibernation is a promising strategy to decrease cellular damage in a variety of fields, such as organ transplantation. Here, we explored the role of mitochondria herein, by comparing epithelial cell lines from a hibernator (hamster kidney cells, HaK) and a non-hibernator (human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293) during cold preservation at 4<U+2009>°C and rewarming. Cell survival (Neutral Red), ATP and MDA levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial morphology (using fluorescent probes) and metabolism (seahorse XF) were assessed. Hypothermia induced dispersion of the tubular mitochondrial network, a loss of MMP, increased oxygen radical (MDA) and decreased ATP production in HEK293. In contrast, HaK maintained MMP and ATP production without an increase in oxygen radicals during cooling and rewarming, resulting in superior cell survival compared to HEK293. Further, normothermic HaK showed a dispersed mitochondrial network and higher respiratory and glycolysis capacity compared to HEK293. Disclosing the mechanisms that hibernators use to counteract cell death in hypothermic and ischemic circumstances may help to eventually improve organ preservation in a variety of fields, including organ transplantation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Derailment of proteostasis, the homeostasis of production, function, and breakdown of proteins, contributes importantly to the self-perpetuating nature of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common heart rhythm disorder in humans. Autophagy plays an important role in proteostasis by degrading aberrant proteins and organelles. Herein, we investigated the role of autophagy and its activation pathway in experimental and clinical AF.CONCLUSIONS: These results identify ER stress-associated autophagy as an important pathway in AF progression and demonstrate the potential therapeutic action of the ER-stress inhibitor 4-phenyl butyrate.</p>

<p>Hibernators tolerate low metabolism, reduced cerebral blood flow and hypothermia during torpor without noticeable neuronal or synaptic dysfunction upon arousal. Previous studies found extensive changes in brain during torpor, including synaptic rearrangements, documented both morphologically and molecularly. As such adaptations may represent organ damage, we anticipated an inflammatory response in brain during specific hibernation phases. In this study, signs of inflammation in the brain were investigated in the Syrian hamster hippocampus (Mesocricetus Auratus) both during hibernation (torpor and arousal phases) and in summer and winter euthermic animals. mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-1ß was quantified by RT-qPCR. Morphological changes of microglia were studied by immunohistochemistry staining for IBA-1. Activation of microglia based on retraction and thickening of the dendritic branches and an increase in cell body size was quantified by calculation of cell body size to total cell size ratio. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was upregulated early in arousal (90<U+202F>min), and normalized after 8<U+202F>h of arousal. Substantial loss of microglia ramification was found throughout torpor and early arousal together with a 2-fold increase in the cell body size to total cell size ratio. Notably, microglia changes were fully reversed in late arousal (8<U+202F>h) to euthermic levels. These results demonstrate an upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and signs of microglia activation during hibernation, which completely resolves by late arousal. Activation of this response may serve to prevent or offset brain damage resulting from the substantial physiological changes accompanying torpor and their rapid change during early arousal.</p>

<p>The incidence and prevalence of cardiac diseases, which are the main cause of death worldwide, are likely to increase because of population ageing. Prevailing theories about the mechanisms of ageing feature the gradual derailment of cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and loss of protein quality control as central factors. In the heart, loss of protein patency, owing to flaws in genetically-determined design or because of environmentally-induced ‘wear and tear’, can overwhelm protein quality control, thereby triggering derailment of proteostasis and contributing to cardiac ageing. Failure of protein quality control involves impairment of chaperones, ubiquitin-proteosomal systems, autophagy, and loss of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins, all of which relate to induction of cardiomyocyte senescence. Targeting protein quality control to maintain cardiac proteostasis offers a novel therapeutic strategy to promote cardiac health and combat cardiac disease. Currently marketed drugs are available to explore this concept in the clinical setting.</p>

<p>Although patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with nephropathy are at high risk for renal and cardiovascular complications, relevant biomarkers have been poorly identified. Because renal impairment may increase biomarker levels, this potentially confounds associations between biomarker levels and risk. To investigate the predictive value of a biomarker in such a setting, we examined baseline levels of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) in relation to renal and cardiovascular risk in T2D patients with nephropathy.</AbstractText>: Although patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with nephropathy are at high risk for renal and cardiovascular complications, relevant biomarkers have been poorly identified.

<p>Research on deep hibernators almost exclusively uses species captured from the wild or from local breeding. An exception is Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), the only standard laboratory animal showing deep hibernation. In deep hibernators, several factors influence hibernation quality, including body mass, sex and diet. We examined hibernation quality in commercially obtained Syrian hamsters in relation to body mass, sex and a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Animals (M/F:30/30, 12 weeks of age) were obtained from Harlan (IN, USA) and individually housed at 21 °C and L:D 14:10 until 20 weeks of age, followed by L:D 8:16 until 27 weeks. Then conditions were changed to 5<U+2009>°C and L:D 0:24 for 9 weeks to induce hibernation. Movement was continuously monitored with passive infrared detectors. Hamsters were randomized to control diet or a diet 3× enriched in linoleic acid from 16 weeks of age. Hamsters showed a high rate of premature death (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>24, 40%), both in animals that did and did not initiate torpor, which was unrelated to body weight, sex and diet. Time to death (31.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>3.1 days, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12) or time to first torpor bout (36.6<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.6 days, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12) was similar in prematurely deceased hamsters. Timing of induction of hibernation and duration of torpor and arousal was unaffected by body weight, sex or diet. Thus, commercially obtained Syrian hamsters subjected to winter conditions showed poor survival, irrespective of body weight, sex and diet. These factors also did not affect hibernation parameters. Possibly, long-term commercial breeding from a confined genetic background has selected against the hibernation trait.</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANCE: Therapeutic hypothermia is commonly applied to limit ischemic injury in organ transplantation, during cardiac and brain surgery and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In these procedures, the kidneys are particularly at risk for ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), likely due to their high rate of metabolism. Although hypothermia mitigates ischemic kidney injury, it is not a panacea. Residual mitochondrial failure is believed to be a key event triggering loss of cellular homeostasis, and potentially cell death. Subsequent rewarming generates large amounts of reactive oxygen species that aggravate organ injury. Recent Advances: Hibernators are able to withstand periods of profoundly reduced metabolism and body temperature (“torpor”), interspersed by brief periods of rewarming (“arousal”) without signs of organ injury. Specific adaptations allow maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, limit oxidative stress, and protect against cell death. These adaptations consist of active suppression of mitochondrial function and upregulation of anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-apoptotic pathways.CRITICAL ISSUES: Unraveling the precise molecular mechanisms that allow hibernators to cycle through torpor and arousal without precipitating organ injury may translate into novel pharmacological approaches to limit IRI in patients.</p>

<p>Encouraging advances in cell therapy research with adipose derived stem cells (ASC) require an effective short-term preservation method that provides time for quality control and transport of cells from their manufacturing facility to their clinical destination. Hypothermic storage of cells in their specific growth media offers an alternative and simple preservation method to liquid nitrogen cryopreservation or commercial preservation fluids for short-term storage and transport. However, accumulation of cell damage during hypothermia may result in cell injury and death upon rewarming through the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, the ability of the cell culture medium additive SUL-109, a modified 6-chromanol, to protect ASC from hypothermia and rewarming damage is examined. SUL-109 conveys protective effects against cold-induced damage in ASC as is observed by preservation of cell viability, adhesion properties and growth potential. SUL-109 does not reduce the multilineage differentiation capacity of ASC. SUL-109 conveys its protection against hypothermic damage by the preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential through the activation of mitochondrial membrane complexes I and IV, and increases maximal oxygen consumption in FCCP uncoupled mitochondria. Consequently, SUL-109 alleviates mitochondrial ROS production and preserves ATP production. In summary, here we describe the generation of a single molecule cell preservation agent that protects ASC from hypothermic damage associated with short-term cell preservation that does not affect the differentiation capacity of ASC.</p>

<p>Chronic transplant dysfunction (CTD) is the primary cause of late allograft loss in kidney transplantation. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is involved in fetomaternal tolerance and IDO gene therapy inhibits acute rejection following kidney transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether gene therapy with IDO is able to attenuate CTD. Transplantation was performed in a rat Dark-Agouti to Wistar-Furth CTD model. Donor kidneys were incubated either with an adenovirus carrying IDO gene, a control adenovirus or saline. During the first 10 days recipients received low-dose cyclosporine. Body weight, blood pressure, serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. Rats were killed after 12 weeks. IDO had a striking beneficial effect on transplant vasculopathy at week 12. It also significantly improved body weight gain; it reduced blood pressure and decreased proteinuria during the follow-up. However, it did not affect the kidney function. In addition, IDO therapy significantly decreased the number of graft-infiltrating macrophages at week 12. The messenger RNA levels of forkhead box p3 and transforming grow factor-ß were elevated in the IDO treated group at week 12. Here we show for first time a clear beneficial effect of local IDO gene therapy especially on transplant vasculopathy in a rat model of renal CTD.</p>

<p>The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) analog FTY720 exerts pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system and causes down-regulation of S1P receptors. Myogenic constriction is an important mechanism regulating resistance vessel function and is known to be modulated by S1P. Here we investigated myogenic constriction and vascular function of mesenteric arteries of rats chronically treated with FTY720. Wistar rats received FTY720 1mg/kg/daily for six weeks. At termination, blood pressure was recorded and small mesenteric arteries collected for vascular studies in a perfusion set up. Myogenic constriction to increased intraluminal pressure was low, but a sub-threshold dose of S1P profoundly augmented myogenic constriction in arteries of both controls and animals chronically treated with FTY720. Interestingly, endothelial denudation blocked the response to S1P in arteries of FTY720-treated animals, but not in control rats. In acute experiments, presence of FTY720 significantly augmented the contractile response to S1P, an effect that was partially abolished after the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-)-derived prostaglandins. FTY720 down regulated S1P1 but not S1P2 in renal resistance arteries and in cultured human endothelial cells. This study therefore demonstrates the endothelium is able to compensate for the complete loss of responsiveness of the smooth muscle layer to S1P after long term FTY720 treatment through a mechanism that most likely involves enhanced production of contractile prostaglandins by the endothelium.</p>

<p>Age comprises the single most important risk factor for cardiac disease development. The incidence and prevalence of cardiac diseases, which represents the main cause of death worldwide, will increase even more because of the aging population. A hallmark of aging is that it is accompanied by a gradual derailment of proteostasis (eg, the homeostasis of protein synthesis, folding, assembly, trafficking, function, and degradation). Loss of proteostasis is highly relevant to cardiomyocytes, because they are postmitotic cells and therefore not constantly replenished by proliferation. The derailment of proteostasis during aging is thus an important factor that preconditions for the development of age-related cardiac diseases, such as atrial fibrillation. In turn, frailty of proteostasis in aging cardiomyocytes is exemplified by its accelerated derailment in multiple cardiac diseases. Here, we review 2 major components of the proteostasis network, the stress-responsive and protein degradation pathways, in healthy and aged cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we discuss the relation between derailment of proteostasis and age-related cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation. Finally, we introduce novel therapeutic targets that might possibly attenuate cardiac aging and thus limit cardiac disease progression.</p>

<p>Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by an intraluminal filament is widely used to study focal brain ischemia in male Sprague-Dawley rats. However, permanent occlusion goes along with a high fatality. To overcome this drawback we designed a new filament carrying a bowling pin-shaped tip (BP-tip) and compared this with three conventionally tipped filaments. Follow-up periods were 24<U+2009>h (all groups) and 72 and 120<U+2009>h in BP-tip group. Ischemic damage and swelling were quantified using silver nitrate staining. Collateral flow via the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was assessed using selective dye perfusion of the internal carotid artery. Despite a comparable decrease of brain perfusion in all groups, ischemic damage was significantly smaller in BP-tips (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Moreover, BP-tip significantly reduced mortality from 60% to 12.5% and widely spared the occipital region and hypothalamus from ischemic damage. Conventional but not BP-tip filaments induced vascular distortion, measured as gross displacement of the MCA origin, which correlated with occipital infarction size. Accordingly, BP-tip occluded rats showed a significantly better collateral filling of the PCA territory. Ischemic volume significantly increased in BP-tip occlusion at 72<U+2009>h follow-up. BP-tip filaments offer superior survival in permanent MCA occlusion, while mimicking the course of a malignant stroke in patients.</p>

<p>COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, neutrophilia and oxidative stress from endogenous and exogenous insults. Current COPD therapy involving anticholinergics, ß2-adrenoceptor agonists and/or corticosteroids, do not specifically target oxidative stress, nor do they reduce chronic pulmonary inflammation and disease progression in all patients. Here, we explore the effects of Sul-121, a novel compound with anti-oxidative capacity, on hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation in experimental models of COPD. Using a guinea pig model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neutrophilia, we demonstrated that Sul-121 inhalation dose-dependently prevented LPS-induced airway neutrophilia (up to ~60%) and AHR (up to ~90%). Non-cartilaginous airways neutrophilia was inversely correlated with blood H2S, and LPS-induced attenuation of blood H2S (~60%) was prevented by Sul-121. Concomitantly, Sul-121 prevented LPS-induced production of the oxidative stress marker, malondialdehyde by ~80%. In immortalized human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, Sul-121 dose-dependently prevented cigarette smoke extract-induced IL-8 release parallel with inhibition of nuclear translocation of the NF-<U+03BA>B subunit, p65 (each ~90%). Sul-121 also diminished cellular reactive oxygen species production in ASM cells, and inhibited nuclear translocation of the anti-oxidative response regulator, Nrf2. Our data show that Sul-121 effectively inhibits airway inflammation and AHR in experimental COPD models, prospectively through inhibition of oxidative stress.</p>

<p>In healthy rats, the physiological variation of baseline endothelial function of intrarenal arteries correlates with the severity of renal damage in response to a subsequent specific renal injury. However, whether such a variation in endothelial function may also condition or predict the variable response to angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibiting treatment in these individuals has not been addressed before. To study this, 5/6 nephrectomy was performed to induce renal injury and chronic kidney disease in a group of healthy Wistar rats. At the time of nephrectomy, interlobar arteries were obtained from the extirpated right kidney and studied in vitro for endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. Six weeks thereafter, treatment with lisinopril was started (n = 11) and continued for 9 wk. Proteinuria (metabolic cages) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; tail cuff) were evaluated weekly, and these were analyzed in relation to renal endothelial function at baseline. 5/6 Nephrectomy induced an increase in SBP and progressive proteinuria. Treatment with lisinopril reduced SBP and slowed proteinuria, albeit to a variable degree among individuals. The acetylcholine-induced renal artery dilation at baseline negatively correlated with lisinopril-induced reduction of proteinuria (r(2) = 0.648, P = 0.003) and with the decrease in SBP (r(2) = 0.592, P = 0.006). Our data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor attenuates the progression of renal damage the most in those individuals with decreased basal renal endothelial-mediated vasodilation.</p>

<p>Cardiomyocytes are long-lived post-mitotic cells with limited regenerative capacity. Proper cardiomyocyte function depends critically on the maintenance of a healthy homeostasis of protein expression, folding, assembly, trafficking, function, and degradation, together commonly referred to as proteostasis. Impairment of proteostasis has a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. Emerging evidence reveals also a role for impaired proteostasis in the pathophysiology of common human cardiac diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy, dilated and ischaemic cardiomyopathies, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have recently been recognized as key modulators which control cardiac proteostasis by deacetylating various proteins. By deacetylating chromatin proteins, including histones, HDACs modulate epigenetic regulation of pathological gene expression. Also, HDACs exert a broad range of functions outside the nucleus by deacetylating structural and contractile proteins. The cytosolic actions of HDACs result in changed protein function through post-translational modifications and/or modulation of their degradation. This review describes the mechanisms underlying the derailment of proteostasis in AF and subsequently focuses on the role of HDACs herein. In addition, the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition to maintain a healthy proteostasis resulting in a delay in AF onset and progression is discussed.</p>

<p>Hypothermia and rewarming produces organ injury through the production of reactive oxygen species. We previously found that dopamine prevents hypothermia and rewarming-induced apoptosis in cultured cells through increased expression of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine ß-Synthase (CBS). Here, we investigate whether dopamine protects the kidney in deep body cooling and explore the role of H2S-producing enzymes in an in vivo rat model of deep hypothermia and rewarming. In anesthetized Wistar rats, body temperature was decreased to 15°C for 3h, followed by rewarming for 1h. Rats (n=5 per group) were treated throughout the procedure with vehicle or dopamine infusion, and in the presence or absence of a non-specific inhibitor of H2S-producing enzymes, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA). Kidney damage and renal expression of three H2S-producing enzymes (CBS, CSE and 3-MST) was quantified and serum H2S level measured. Hypothermia and rewarming induced renal damage, evidenced by increased serum creatinine, renal reactive oxygen species production, KIM-1 expression and influx of immune cells, which was accompanied by substantially lowered renal expression of CBS, CSE, and 3-MST and lowered serum H2S levels. Infusion of dopamine fully attenuated renal damage and maintained expression of H2S-producing enzymes, while normalizing serum H2S. AOAA further decreased the expression of H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S level, and aggravated renal damage. Hence, dopamine preserves renal integrity during deep hypothermia and rewarming likely by maintaining the expression of renal H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia is used to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) during organ transplantation and major surgery, but does not fully prevent organ injury. Interestingly, hibernating animals undergo repetitive periods of low body temperature called ‘torpor’ without signs of organ injury. Recently, we identified an essential role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in entrance into torpor and preservation of kidney integrity during hibernation. A torpor-like state can be induced pharmacologically by injecting 5’-Adenosine monophosphate (5’-AMP). The mechanism by which 5’-AMP leads to the induction of a torpor-like state, and the role of H2S herein, remains to be unraveled. Therefore, we investigated whether induction of a torpor-like state by 5-AMP depends on H2S production.METHODS: To study the role of H2S on the induction of torpor, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA), a non-specific inhibitor of H2S, was administered before injection with 5’-AMP to block endogenous H2S production in Syrian hamster. To assess the role of H2S on maintenance of torpor induced by 5’-AMP, additional animals were injected with AOAA during torpor.KEY RESULTS: During the torpor-like state induced by 5’-AMP, the expression of H2S- synthesizing enzymes in the kidneys and plasma levels of H2S were increased. Blockade of these enzymes inhibited the rise in the plasma level of H2S, but neither precluded torpor nor induced arousal. Remarkably, blockade of endogenous H2S production was associated with increased renal injury.CONCLUSIONS: Induction of a torpor-like state by 5’-AMP does not depend on H2S, although production of H2S seems to attenuate renal injury. Unraveling the mechanisms by which 5’-AMP reduces the metabolism without organ injury may allow optimization of current strategies to limit (hypothermic) IRI and improve outcome following organ transplantation, major cardiac and brain surgery.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved program of stress-induced gene expression, aimed at reestablishing protein homeostasis to preserve cellular fitness. Cells that fail to activate or maintain this protective response are hypersensitive to proteotoxic stress. The HSR is mediated by the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which binds to conserved heat shock elements (HSE) in the promoter region of heat shock genes, resulting in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP). Recently, we observed that hyperactivation of RhoA conditions cardiomyocytes for the cardiac arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. Also, the HSR is annihilated in atrial fibrillation, and induction of HSR mitigates sensitization of cells to this disease. Therefore, we hypothesized active RhoA to suppress the HSR resulting in sensitization of cells for proteotoxic stimuli.METHODS AND RESULTS: Stimulation of RhoA activity significantly suppressed the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR in HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes as determined with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the HSF1 regulated human HSP70 (HSPA1A) promoter and HSP protein expression by Western Blot analysis. Inversely, RhoA inhibition boosted the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR. While active RhoA did not preclude HSF1 nuclear accumulation, phosphorylation, acetylation, or sumoylation, it did impair binding of HSF1 to the hsp genes promoter element HSE. Impaired binding results in suppression of HSP expression and sensitized cells to proteotoxic stress.CONCLUSION: These results reveal that active RhoA negatively regulates the HSR via attenuation of the HSF1-HSE binding and thus may play a role in sensitizing cells to proteotoxic stimuli.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Chronic transplant dysfunction (CTD) is the leading cause of long-term loss of the renal allograft. So far, no single test is available to reliably predict the risk for CTD. Monitoring of tryptophan (trp) metabolism through indoleamine 2.3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been previously proposed to predict acute rejection of human kidney transplants. Here, we investigate the potential of IDO/trp degradation along the kynurenine (kyn) pathway to predict the long-term outcome of human kidney transplantation.METHODS: During the 2-year follow-up blood, urine, and kidney biopsies were collected from 48 renal transplant patients. Concentrations of kyn and trp in serum and urine were measured at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after transplantation. Kynurenine to tryptophan ratio was calculated as an estimate of trp degradation. To evaluate the histological changes and IDO expression, respectively, periodic acid schiff staining and immunohistochemistry for IDO were performed on biopsies taken at 6 months and 2 years.RESULTS: Two years after transplantation, kyn/trp was increased in urine and decreased in serum as compared to 2-week values. In 2-year biopsies, IDO expression was mainly found in infiltrating inflammatory cells and in the glomeruli. The urine level of trp 2 weeks after transplantation predicted the serum creatinine 6 months and the estimated creatinine clearance 2 years after transplantation. Additionally, serum level of kyn 6 months after transplantation predicted the serum creatinine 2 years after transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Early serum and urine levels of trp and kyn may offer a novel route for early detection of patients at risk for developing CTD.</p>

<p>It has been firmly established that ageing constitutes a principal risk factor for cardiac disease. Currently, the underlying mechanisms of ageing that contribute to the initiation or acceleration of cardiac disease are essentially unresolved. Prevailing theories of ageing center on the loss of cellular protein homeostasis, by either design (genetically) or “wear and tear” (environmentally). Either or both ways, the normal protein homeostasis in the cell is affected, resulting in aberrant and misfolded proteins. Should such misfolded proteins escape the protein quality control (PQC) system, they become proteotoxic and accelerate the loss of cellular integrity. Impairment of PQC plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ageing-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s, Huntington<U+05F3>s, and Alzheimer<U+05F3>s disease. The concept of an impaired PQC driving ageing-related diseases has recently been expanded to cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the PQC system in relation to ageing and discuss the emerging concept of the loss of PQC in cardiomyocytes as a trigger for cardiac disease. Finally, we discuss the potential of boosting the PQC system as an innovative therapeutic target to treat cardiac disease in the elderly.</p>

<p>The case of a 55-year-old man who attempted suicide by ingesting &lt;100<U+2009>mL of 28% sodium chlorite solution is presented. On arrival in the intensive care unit, the patient appeared cyanotic with lowered consciousness and displayed anuria and chocolate brown serum.Initial laboratory tests revealed 40% of methemoglobin. The formation of methemoglobin was effectively treated with methylene blue (10% after 29 hours).To remove the toxin, and because of the anuric acute renal failure, the patient received renal replacement therapy. Despite these therapeutic measures, the patient developed hemolytic anemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which were treated with red blood cell transfusion and intermittent hemodialysis. These interventions led to the improvement of his condition and the patient eventually fully recovered. Patient gave written informed consent.This is the third known case of chlorite poisoning that has been reported. Based upon this case, we suggest the management of sodium chlorite poisoning to comprise the early administration of methylene blue, in addition to renal replacement therapy and transfusion of red blood cells.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may induce systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) modulates various vascular and immune responses. Here we explored whether agonists of the S1P receptors, FTY720 and SEW2871 improve vascular reactivity after CPB in the rat.METHODS: Experiments were done in male Wistar rats (total n = 127). Anesthesia was induced by isoflurane (2.5-3%) and maintained by fentanyl and midazolam during CPB. After catheterization of the left femoral artery, carotid artery and the right atrium, normothermic extracorporeal circulation was instituted for 60 minutes. In the first part of the study animals were euthanized after either 1 hour, 1 day, 2 or 5 days of the recovery period. In second part of the study animals were euthanized after 1 day of postoperative period. We evaluated the contractile response to phenylephrine (mesenteric arteries) or to serotonin (coronary artery) and vasodilatory response to acethylcholine (both arteries).RESULTS: Contractile responses to phenylephrine were reduced at 1 day recovery after CPB and Sham as compared to healthy control animals (Emax, mN: 7.9 ± 1.9, 6.5 ± 1.5, and 11.3 ± 1.3, respectively). Mainly FTY720, but not SEW2871, caused lymphopenia in both Sham and CPB groups. In coronary and mesenteric arteries, both FTY720 and SEW2871 normalized serotonin and phenylephrine-mediated vascular reactivity after CPB (p&lt;0.05) and FTY720 increased relaxation to acetylcholine as compared with untreated rats that underwent CPB.CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with FTY720 or SEW2871 preserves vascular function in mesenteric and coronary artery after CPB. Therefore, pharmacological activation of S1P1 receptors may provide a promising therapeutic intervention to prevent CPB-related vascular dysfunction in patients.</p>

<p>Hibernation is an energy-conserving behavior in winter characterized by two phases: torpor and arousal. During torpor, markedly reduced metabolic activity results in inactivity and decreased body temperature. Arousal periods intersperse the torpor bouts and feature increased metabolism and euthermic body temperature. Alterations in physiological parameters, such as suppression of hemostasis, are thought to allow hibernators to survive periods of torpor and arousal without organ injury. While the state of torpor is potentially procoagulant, due to low blood flow, increased viscosity, immobility, hypoxia, and low body temperature, organ injury due to thromboembolism is absent. To investigate platelet dynamics during hibernation, we measured platelet count and function during and after natural torpor, pharmacologically induced torpor and forced hypothermia. Splenectomies were performed to unravel potential storage sites of platelets during torpor. Here we show that decreasing body temperature drives thrombocytopenia during torpor in hamster with maintained functionality of circulating platelets. Interestingly, hamster platelets during torpor do not express P-selectin, but expression is induced by treatment with ADP. Platelet count rapidly restores during arousal and rewarming. Platelet dynamics in hibernation are not affected by splenectomy before or during torpor. Reversible thrombocytopenia was also induced by forced hypothermia in both hibernating (hamster) and non-hibernating (rat and mouse) species without changing platelet function. Pharmacological torpor induced by injection of 5’-AMP in mice did not induce thrombocytopenia, possibly because 5’-AMP inhibits platelet function. The rapidness of changes in the numbers of circulating platelets, as well as marginal changes in immature platelet fractions upon arousal, strongly suggest that storage-and-release underlies the reversible thrombocytopenia during natural torpor. Possibly, margination of platelets, dependent on intrinsic platelet functionality, governs clearance of circulating platelets during torpor.</p>

<p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) agonists have been shown to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy, but much less are known about their effects in non-diabetic nephropathies. In the present study, metabolic parameters, blood pressure, aortic endothelial function along with molecular and structural markers of glomerular and tubulointerstitial renal damage, were studied in a rat model of normotensive nephropathy induced by adriamycin and treated with PPAR<U+03B3> agonist pioglitazone (12mg/kg, po), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (1mg/kg, po) or their combination. Pioglitazone had no effect on systolic blood pressure, marginally reduced glycemia and improved aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation. In the kidney, pioglitazone prevented the development of proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis to the similar extent as blood-pressure lowering ramipril. Renoprotection provided by either treatment was associated with a reduction in the cortical expression of profibrotic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and microvascular damage-inducing endothelin-1, and a limitation of interstitial macrophage influx. Treatment with PPAR<U+03B3> agonist, as well as ACE inhibitor comparably affected renal expression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, normalizing increased renal expression of ACE and enhancing the expression of Mas receptor. Interestingly, combined pioglitazone and ramipril treatment did not provide any additional renoprotection. These results demonstrate that in a nondiabetic renal disease, such as adriamycin-induced nephropathy, PPAR<U+03B3> agonist pioglitazone provides renoprotection to a similar extent as an ACE inhibitor by interfering with the expression of local RAS components and attenuating related profibrotic and inflammatory mechanisms. The combination of the both agents, however, does not lead to any additional renal benefit.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is the main contributor to the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the brain. Exogenously administered H2S has been reported to protect neurons against hypoxic injury, ischemia and LPS-induced neuro-inflammation and in the facilitating of long term potentiation (LTP). Dysregulation of CBS leads to different diseases, which all have mental retardation in common. Although multiple studies have implicated a link between the CBS/H2S pathway and neurodegeneration, no studies have been performed examining the pathway in healthy aging animals. We hypothesize that CBS/H2S pathway plays an important role in the protection of learning and memory functions in the brain at the level of the hippocampus. Thus, we studied a set of 8 young (4 months) and 14 aged (24 months (n=6) and 28 months (n=8)) C57Bl6 mice. The 24-month-old mice displayed a significant decrease of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG only, compared to 4-month-old mice. In 28-month-old mice, we observed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG, compared to 4-month-old mice. When comparing 28-month-old mice to 24-month-old mice, all areas showed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity. Thus, throughout aging, CBS expression is maintained in the hippocampus, and many other forebrain regions as well. Mice at the unusual age of 28 months even have a higher hippocampal CBS expression than young mice. Maintenance (and increase) of CBS levels may sustain memory and learning by precluding neuronal loss in areas of the hippocampus.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Diabetes and particularly high blood glucose levels are implicated in neurodegeneration. One of the hallmarks of neurodegeneration is protein aggregation. We investigated the presence of protein aggregation in the frontal brain of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, an animal model for diabetes. Further, the effect of NaHS in suppressing protein aggregation in cultured brain slices from ZDF was assessed.RESULTS: The levels of protein synthesis, protein/gene expression, autophagy and anti-oxidant defense were evaluated in ZDF and control (Lean) brains.Compared to Lean, ZDF brains displayed a significant increase in protein aggregates, p-tau, fibronectin expression and protein glycosylation. Increased phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 ribosomal protein in ZDF indicated higher protein synthesis, while the increase in ubiquitinated proteins and LC3-I in ZDF brains accompanied by lower LC3-II expression and LC3-II/LC3-I levels indicated the blockage of proteolytic pathways. CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) protein and mRNA expression and thiol group levels in ZDF brains were lower compared to Lean. ZDF brains show a higher level of reactive oxygen species. In vitro NaHS treatment normalized proteostasis while counteracting oxidative stress.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate increased protein synthesis and aggregation in the diabetic ZDF rat brain, which was reversible by NaHS treatment.This is the first report on the potential use of NaHS as a novel strategy against protein aggregation in diabetic brain.</p>

<p>Ultrasound and microbubble-targeted delivery (UMTD) is a promising non-viral technique for genetic-based therapy. We found that UMTD of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is more effective than delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA). UMTD (1 MHz, 0.22 MPa) of fluorescently labeled siRNA resulted in 97.9 ± 1.5% transfected cells, with siRNA localized homogenously in the cytoplasm directly after ultrasound exposure. UMTD of fluorescently labeled pDNA resulted in only 43.0 ± 4.2% transfected cells, with localization mainly in vesicular structures, co-localizing with endocytosis markers clathrin and caveolin. Delivery of siRNA against GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) effectively decreased protein levels to 24.3 ± 7.9% of non-treated controls (p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, 24 h after delivery of pDNA encoding GAPDH, no increase in protein levels was detected. Transfection efficiency, verified with red fluorescently labeled pDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein, revealed that of the transfected cells, only 2.0 ± 0.7% expressed the transgene. In conclusion, the difference in localization between siRNA and pDNA after UMTD is an important determinant of the effectiveness of these genetic-based technologies.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: We investigated endothelial dysfunction and the role of angiotensin (Ang)-II type I (AT1-R) and type II (AT2-R) receptor in the changes in the Ang-II sensitivity in experimental preeclampsia in the rat.METHODS: Aortic rings were isolated from low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infused pregnant rats (experimental preeclampsia; n=9), saline-infused pregnant rats (n=8), and saline (n=8) and LPS (n=8) infused non-pregnant rats. Endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was studied in phenylephrine-preconstricted aortic rings in the presence of vehicle, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and/or indomethacin. To evaluate the role for AT1-R and AT2-R in Ang-II sensitivity, full concentration response curves were obtained for Ang-II in the presence of losartan or PD123319. mRNA expression of the AT1-R and AT2-R, eNOS and iNOS, COX1 and COX2 in aorta were evaluated using real-time RT-PCR.RESULTS: The role of vasodilator prostaglandins in the aorta was increased and the role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and response of the AT1-R and AT2-R to Ang-II was decreased in pregnant saline infused rats as compared with non-pregnant rats. These changes were not observed during preeclampsia.CONCLUSION: Pregnancy induced adaptations in endothelial function, which were not observed in the rat model for preeclampsia. This role of lack of pregnancy induced endothelial adaptation in the pathophysiology of experimental preeclampsia needs further investigation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by structural remodeling, contractile dysfunction, and AF progression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence acetylation of both histones and cytosolic proteins, thereby mediating epigenetic regulation and influencing cell proteostasis. Because the exact function of HDACs in AF is unknown, we investigated their role in experimental and clinical AF models.METHODS AND RESULTS: Tachypacing of HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila pupae hearts significantly impaired contractile function (amplitude of Ca(2+) transients and heart wall contractions). This dysfunction was prevented by inhibition of HDAC6 (tubacin) and sirtuins (nicotinamide). Tachypacing induced specific activation of HDAC6, resulting in a-tubulin deacetylation, depolymerization, and degradation by calpain. Tachypacing-induced contractile dysfunction was completely rescued by dominant-negative HDAC6 mutants with loss of deacetylase activity in the second catalytic domain, which bears a-tubulin deacetylase activity. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubastatin A protected atrial tachypaced dogs from electric remodeling (action potential duration shortening, L-type Ca(2+) current reduction, AF promotion) and cellular Ca(2+)-handling/contractile dysfunction (loss of Ca(2+) transient amplitude, sarcomere contractility). Finally, atrial tissue from patients with AF also showed a significant increase in HDAC6 activity and reduction in the expression of both acetylated and total a-tubulin.CONCLUSIONS: AF induces remodeling and loss of contractile function, at least in part through HDAC6 activation and subsequent derailment of a-tubulin proteostasis and disruption of the cardiomyocyte microtubule structure. In vivo inhibition of HDAC6 protects against AF-related atrial remodeling, disclosing the potential of HDAC6 as a therapeutic target in clinical AF.</p>

<p>Gasotransmitters fulfill important roles in cellular homeostasis having been linked to various pathologies, including inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the known pathways mediating the actions of gasotransmitters, their effects in regulating mitochondrial function are emerging. Given that mitochondria are key organelles in energy production, formation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, they are important mediators in preserving health and disease. Preserving or restoring mitochondrial function by gasotransmitters may be beneficial, and mitigate pathogenetic processes. In this review we discuss the actions of gasotransmitters with focus on their role in mitochondrial function and their therapeutic potential.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical tachyarrhythmia with a strong tendency to progress in time. AF progression is driven by derailment of protein homeostasis, which ultimately causes contractile dysfunction of the atria. Here we report that tachypacing-induced functional loss of atrial cardiomyocytes is precipitated by excessive poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation in response to oxidative DNA damage. PARP1-mediated synthesis of ADP-ribose chains in turn depletes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), induces further DNA damage and contractile dysfunction. Accordingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> replenishment or PARP1 depletion precludes functional loss. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 protects against tachypacing-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, oxidative stress, DNA damage and contractile dysfunction in atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila. Consistently, cardiomyocytes of persistent AF patients show significant DNA damage, which correlates with PARP1 activity. The findings uncover a mechanism by which tachypacing impairs cardiomyocyte function and implicates PARP1 as a possible therapeutic target that may preserve cardiomyocyte function in clinical AF.</p>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common persistent clinical tachyarrhythmia, is associated with altered gene transcription which underlies cardiomyocyte dysfunction, AF susceptibility and progression. Recent research showed class I and class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) to regulate pathological and fetal gene expression, and thereby induce hypertrophy and cardiac contractile dysfunction. Whether class I and class IIa HDACs are involved in AF promotion is unknown. We aim to elucidate the role of class I and class IIa HDACs in tachypacing-induced contractile dysfunction in experimental model systems for AF and clinical AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Class I and IIa HDACs were overexpressed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes followed by calcium transient (CaT) measurements. Overexpression of class I HDACs, HDAC1 or HDAC3, significantly reduced CaT amplitude in control normal-paced (1<U+202F>Hz) cardiomyocytes, which was further reduced by tachypacing (5<U+202F>Hz) in HDAC3 overexpressing cardiomyocytes. HDAC3 inhibition by shRNA or by the specific inhibitor, RGFP966, prevented contractile dysfunction in both tachypaced HL-1 cardiomyocytes and Drosophila prepupae. Conversely, overexpression of class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 or HDAC9) did not affect CaT in controls, with HDAC5 and HDAC7 overexpression even protecting against tachypacing-induced CaT loss. Notably, the protective effect of HDAC5 and HDAC7 was abolished in cardiomyocytes overexpressing a dominant negative HDAC5 or HDAC7 mutant, bearing a mutation in the binding domain for myosin enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Furthermore, tachypacing induced phosphorylation of HDAC5 and promoted its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm, leading to up-regulation of MEF2-related fetal gene expression (ß-MHC, BNP). In accord, boosting nuclear localization of HDAC5 by MC1568 or Go6983 attenuated CaT loss in tachypaced HL-1 cardiomyocytes and preserved contractile function in Drosophila prepupae. Findings were expanded to clinical AF. Here, patients with AF showed a significant increase in expression levels and activity of HDAC3, phosphorylated HDAC5 and fetal genes (ß-MHC, BNP) in atrial tissue compared to controls in sinus rhythm. CONCLUSION: Class I and class IIa HDACs display converse roles in AF progression. Whereas overexpression of Class I HDAC3 induces cardiomyocyte dysfunction, class IIa HDAC5 overexpression reveals protective properties. Accordingly, HDAC3 inhibitors and HDAC5 nuclear boosters show protection from tachypacing-induced changes and therefore may represent interesting therapeutic options in clinical AF.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in kidney damage in various pathologies, including acute and chronic kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy. In addition to the well-studied ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, hypothermia/rewarming (H/R) also inflicts acute kidney injury. Substituted 6-hydroxychromanols are a novel class of mitochondrial medicines that ameliorate mitochondrial oxidative stress and protect the mitochondrial network. To identify a novel 6-hydroxychromanol that protects mitochondrial structure and function in the kidney during H/R, we screened multiple compounds in vitro and subsequently assessed the efficacy of the 6-hydroxychromanol derivatives SUL-109 and SUL-121 in vivo to protect against kidney injury after H/R in rats.</AbstractText>: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in kidney damage in various pathologies, including acute and chronic kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy.

<p>BACKGROUND: Post-transplant tuberculosis (PTTB) is a serious opportunistic infection in renal graft recipients with a 30-70 fold higher incidence compared to the general population. PTTB occurs most frequently within the first years after transplantation, manifesting as pulmonary or disseminated TB. Gastrointestinal TB (GITB) is a rare and potentially lethal manifestation of PTTB and may show delayed onset in renal transplant recipients due to the use of lower doses of immunosuppressants. Further, non-specificity of symptoms and the common occurrence of GI disorders in transplant recipients may delay diagnosis of GITB.CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a rare survival case of isolated GITB in a renal transplant recipient, occurring seven years after transplantation. The patient’s condition was complicated by severe sepsis with positive blood culture Staphylococcus haemolyticus, septic shock, multiple organ failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute renal failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor circulatory support and intermittent hemodialysis. Furthermore, nosocomial infections such as invasive aspergillosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred during hospitalization. Antituberculosis therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) was initiated upon Mycobacterium confirmation. Moreover, treatment with voriconazole due to the Aspergillus flavus and meropenem due to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was initiated, the former necessitating discontinuation of rifampicin. After 34 days, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and was discharged to the pulmonary ward, followed by complete recovery.CONCLUSION: This case offers a guideline for the clinical management towards survival of GITB in transplant patients, complicated by septic shock and multiple organ failure, including acute renal injury and ARDS.</p>

<p>Hibernators show superior resistance to ischemia and hypothermia, also outside the hibernation season. Therefore, hibernation is a promising strategy to decrease cellular damage in a variety of fields, such as organ transplantation. Here, we explored the role of mitochondria herein, by comparing epithelial cell lines from a hibernator (hamster kidney cells, HaK) and a non-hibernator (human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293) during cold preservation at 4<U+2009>°C and rewarming. Cell survival (Neutral Red), ATP and MDA levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial morphology (using fluorescent probes) and metabolism (seahorse XF) were assessed. Hypothermia induced dispersion of the tubular mitochondrial network, a loss of MMP, increased oxygen radical (MDA) and decreased ATP production in HEK293. In contrast, HaK maintained MMP and ATP production without an increase in oxygen radicals during cooling and rewarming, resulting in superior cell survival compared to HEK293. Further, normothermic HaK showed a dispersed mitochondrial network and higher respiratory and glycolysis capacity compared to HEK293. Disclosing the mechanisms that hibernators use to counteract cell death in hypothermic and ischemic circumstances may help to eventually improve organ preservation in a variety of fields, including organ transplantation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Derailment of proteostasis, the homeostasis of production, function, and breakdown of proteins, contributes importantly to the self-perpetuating nature of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common heart rhythm disorder in humans. Autophagy plays an important role in proteostasis by degrading aberrant proteins and organelles. Herein, we investigated the role of autophagy and its activation pathway in experimental and clinical AF.CONCLUSIONS: These results identify ER stress-associated autophagy as an important pathway in AF progression and demonstrate the potential therapeutic action of the ER-stress inhibitor 4-phenyl butyrate.</p>

<p>Hibernators tolerate low metabolism, reduced cerebral blood flow and hypothermia during torpor without noticeable neuronal or synaptic dysfunction upon arousal. Previous studies found extensive changes in brain during torpor, including synaptic rearrangements, documented both morphologically and molecularly. As such adaptations may represent organ damage, we anticipated an inflammatory response in brain during specific hibernation phases. In this study, signs of inflammation in the brain were investigated in the Syrian hamster hippocampus (Mesocricetus Auratus) both during hibernation (torpor and arousal phases) and in summer and winter euthermic animals. mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-1ß was quantified by RT-qPCR. Morphological changes of microglia were studied by immunohistochemistry staining for IBA-1. Activation of microglia based on retraction and thickening of the dendritic branches and an increase in cell body size was quantified by calculation of cell body size to total cell size ratio. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was upregulated early in arousal (90<U+202F>min), and normalized after 8<U+202F>h of arousal. Substantial loss of microglia ramification was found throughout torpor and early arousal together with a 2-fold increase in the cell body size to total cell size ratio. Notably, microglia changes were fully reversed in late arousal (8<U+202F>h) to euthermic levels. These results demonstrate an upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and signs of microglia activation during hibernation, which completely resolves by late arousal. Activation of this response may serve to prevent or offset brain damage resulting from the substantial physiological changes accompanying torpor and their rapid change during early arousal.</p>

<p>The incidence and prevalence of cardiac diseases, which are the main cause of death worldwide, are likely to increase because of population ageing. Prevailing theories about the mechanisms of ageing feature the gradual derailment of cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and loss of protein quality control as central factors. In the heart, loss of protein patency, owing to flaws in genetically-determined design or because of environmentally-induced ‘wear and tear’, can overwhelm protein quality control, thereby triggering derailment of proteostasis and contributing to cardiac ageing. Failure of protein quality control involves impairment of chaperones, ubiquitin-proteosomal systems, autophagy, and loss of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins, all of which relate to induction of cardiomyocyte senescence. Targeting protein quality control to maintain cardiac proteostasis offers a novel therapeutic strategy to promote cardiac health and combat cardiac disease. Currently marketed drugs are available to explore this concept in the clinical setting.</p>

<p>Although patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with nephropathy are at high risk for renal and cardiovascular complications, relevant biomarkers have been poorly identified. Because renal impairment may increase biomarker levels, this potentially confounds associations between biomarker levels and risk. To investigate the predictive value of a biomarker in such a setting, we examined baseline levels of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) in relation to renal and cardiovascular risk in T2D patients with nephropathy.</AbstractText>: Although patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with nephropathy are at high risk for renal and cardiovascular complications, relevant biomarkers have been poorly identified.

<p>Research on deep hibernators almost exclusively uses species captured from the wild or from local breeding. An exception is Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), the only standard laboratory animal showing deep hibernation. In deep hibernators, several factors influence hibernation quality, including body mass, sex and diet. We examined hibernation quality in commercially obtained Syrian hamsters in relation to body mass, sex and a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Animals (M/F:30/30, 12 weeks of age) were obtained from Harlan (IN, USA) and individually housed at 21 °C and L:D 14:10 until 20 weeks of age, followed by L:D 8:16 until 27 weeks. Then conditions were changed to 5<U+2009>°C and L:D 0:24 for 9 weeks to induce hibernation. Movement was continuously monitored with passive infrared detectors. Hamsters were randomized to control diet or a diet 3× enriched in linoleic acid from 16 weeks of age. Hamsters showed a high rate of premature death (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>24, 40%), both in animals that did and did not initiate torpor, which was unrelated to body weight, sex and diet. Time to death (31.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>3.1 days, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12) or time to first torpor bout (36.6<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.6 days, n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12) was similar in prematurely deceased hamsters. Timing of induction of hibernation and duration of torpor and arousal was unaffected by body weight, sex or diet. Thus, commercially obtained Syrian hamsters subjected to winter conditions showed poor survival, irrespective of body weight, sex and diet. These factors also did not affect hibernation parameters. Possibly, long-term commercial breeding from a confined genetic background has selected against the hibernation trait.</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANCE: Therapeutic hypothermia is commonly applied to limit ischemic injury in organ transplantation, during cardiac and brain surgery and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In these procedures, the kidneys are particularly at risk for ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), likely due to their high rate of metabolism. Although hypothermia mitigates ischemic kidney injury, it is not a panacea. Residual mitochondrial failure is believed to be a key event triggering loss of cellular homeostasis, and potentially cell death. Subsequent rewarming generates large amounts of reactive oxygen species that aggravate organ injury. Recent Advances: Hibernators are able to withstand periods of profoundly reduced metabolism and body temperature (“torpor”), interspersed by brief periods of rewarming (“arousal”) without signs of organ injury. Specific adaptations allow maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, limit oxidative stress, and protect against cell death. These adaptations consist of active suppression of mitochondrial function and upregulation of anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-apoptotic pathways.CRITICAL ISSUES: Unraveling the precise molecular mechanisms that allow hibernators to cycle through torpor and arousal without precipitating organ injury may translate into novel pharmacological approaches to limit IRI in patients.</p>

<p>Encouraging advances in cell therapy research with adipose derived stem cells (ASC) require an effective short-term preservation method that provides time for quality control and transport of cells from their manufacturing facility to their clinical destination. Hypothermic storage of cells in their specific growth media offers an alternative and simple preservation method to liquid nitrogen cryopreservation or commercial preservation fluids for short-term storage and transport. However, accumulation of cell damage during hypothermia may result in cell injury and death upon rewarming through the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, the ability of the cell culture medium additive SUL-109, a modified 6-chromanol, to protect ASC from hypothermia and rewarming damage is examined. SUL-109 conveys protective effects against cold-induced damage in ASC as is observed by preservation of cell viability, adhesion properties and growth potential. SUL-109 does not reduce the multilineage differentiation capacity of ASC. SUL-109 conveys its protection against hypothermic damage by the preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential through the activation of mitochondrial membrane complexes I and IV, and increases maximal oxygen consumption in FCCP uncoupled mitochondria. Consequently, SUL-109 alleviates mitochondrial ROS production and preserves ATP production. In summary, here we describe the generation of a single molecule cell preservation agent that protects ASC from hypothermic damage associated with short-term cell preservation that does not affect the differentiation capacity of ASC.</p>

<p>Chronic transplant dysfunction (CTD) is the primary cause of late allograft loss in kidney transplantation. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is involved in fetomaternal tolerance and IDO gene therapy inhibits acute rejection following kidney transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether gene therapy with IDO is able to attenuate CTD. Transplantation was performed in a rat Dark-Agouti to Wistar-Furth CTD model. Donor kidneys were incubated either with an adenovirus carrying IDO gene, a control adenovirus or saline. During the first 10 days recipients received low-dose cyclosporine. Body weight, blood pressure, serum creatinine and proteinuria were measured every 2 weeks. Rats were killed after 12 weeks. IDO had a striking beneficial effect on transplant vasculopathy at week 12. It also significantly improved body weight gain; it reduced blood pressure and decreased proteinuria during the follow-up. However, it did not affect the kidney function. In addition, IDO therapy significantly decreased the number of graft-infiltrating macrophages at week 12. The messenger RNA levels of forkhead box p3 and transforming grow factor-ß were elevated in the IDO treated group at week 12. Here we show for first time a clear beneficial effect of local IDO gene therapy especially on transplant vasculopathy in a rat model of renal CTD.</p>

<p>The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) analog FTY720 exerts pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system and causes down-regulation of S1P receptors. Myogenic constriction is an important mechanism regulating resistance vessel function and is known to be modulated by S1P. Here we investigated myogenic constriction and vascular function of mesenteric arteries of rats chronically treated with FTY720. Wistar rats received FTY720 1mg/kg/daily for six weeks. At termination, blood pressure was recorded and small mesenteric arteries collected for vascular studies in a perfusion set up. Myogenic constriction to increased intraluminal pressure was low, but a sub-threshold dose of S1P profoundly augmented myogenic constriction in arteries of both controls and animals chronically treated with FTY720. Interestingly, endothelial denudation blocked the response to S1P in arteries of FTY720-treated animals, but not in control rats. In acute experiments, presence of FTY720 significantly augmented the contractile response to S1P, an effect that was partially abolished after the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-)-derived prostaglandins. FTY720 down regulated S1P1 but not S1P2 in renal resistance arteries and in cultured human endothelial cells. This study therefore demonstrates the endothelium is able to compensate for the complete loss of responsiveness of the smooth muscle layer to S1P after long term FTY720 treatment through a mechanism that most likely involves enhanced production of contractile prostaglandins by the endothelium.</p>

<p>Age comprises the single most important risk factor for cardiac disease development. The incidence and prevalence of cardiac diseases, which represents the main cause of death worldwide, will increase even more because of the aging population. A hallmark of aging is that it is accompanied by a gradual derailment of proteostasis (eg, the homeostasis of protein synthesis, folding, assembly, trafficking, function, and degradation). Loss of proteostasis is highly relevant to cardiomyocytes, because they are postmitotic cells and therefore not constantly replenished by proliferation. The derailment of proteostasis during aging is thus an important factor that preconditions for the development of age-related cardiac diseases, such as atrial fibrillation. In turn, frailty of proteostasis in aging cardiomyocytes is exemplified by its accelerated derailment in multiple cardiac diseases. Here, we review 2 major components of the proteostasis network, the stress-responsive and protein degradation pathways, in healthy and aged cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we discuss the relation between derailment of proteostasis and age-related cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation. Finally, we introduce novel therapeutic targets that might possibly attenuate cardiac aging and thus limit cardiac disease progression.</p>

<p>Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by an intraluminal filament is widely used to study focal brain ischemia in male Sprague-Dawley rats. However, permanent occlusion goes along with a high fatality. To overcome this drawback we designed a new filament carrying a bowling pin-shaped tip (BP-tip) and compared this with three conventionally tipped filaments. Follow-up periods were 24<U+2009>h (all groups) and 72 and 120<U+2009>h in BP-tip group. Ischemic damage and swelling were quantified using silver nitrate staining. Collateral flow via the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was assessed using selective dye perfusion of the internal carotid artery. Despite a comparable decrease of brain perfusion in all groups, ischemic damage was significantly smaller in BP-tips (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). Moreover, BP-tip significantly reduced mortality from 60% to 12.5% and widely spared the occipital region and hypothalamus from ischemic damage. Conventional but not BP-tip filaments induced vascular distortion, measured as gross displacement of the MCA origin, which correlated with occipital infarction size. Accordingly, BP-tip occluded rats showed a significantly better collateral filling of the PCA territory. Ischemic volume significantly increased in BP-tip occlusion at 72<U+2009>h follow-up. BP-tip filaments offer superior survival in permanent MCA occlusion, while mimicking the course of a malignant stroke in patients.</p>

<p>COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, neutrophilia and oxidative stress from endogenous and exogenous insults. Current COPD therapy involving anticholinergics, ß2-adrenoceptor agonists and/or corticosteroids, do not specifically target oxidative stress, nor do they reduce chronic pulmonary inflammation and disease progression in all patients. Here, we explore the effects of Sul-121, a novel compound with anti-oxidative capacity, on hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation in experimental models of COPD. Using a guinea pig model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neutrophilia, we demonstrated that Sul-121 inhalation dose-dependently prevented LPS-induced airway neutrophilia (up to ~60%) and AHR (up to ~90%). Non-cartilaginous airways neutrophilia was inversely correlated with blood H2S, and LPS-induced attenuation of blood H2S (~60%) was prevented by Sul-121. Concomitantly, Sul-121 prevented LPS-induced production of the oxidative stress marker, malondialdehyde by ~80%. In immortalized human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, Sul-121 dose-dependently prevented cigarette smoke extract-induced IL-8 release parallel with inhibition of nuclear translocation of the NF-<U+03BA>B subunit, p65 (each ~90%). Sul-121 also diminished cellular reactive oxygen species production in ASM cells, and inhibited nuclear translocation of the anti-oxidative response regulator, Nrf2. Our data show that Sul-121 effectively inhibits airway inflammation and AHR in experimental COPD models, prospectively through inhibition of oxidative stress.</p>

<p>In healthy rats, the physiological variation of baseline endothelial function of intrarenal arteries correlates with the severity of renal damage in response to a subsequent specific renal injury. However, whether such a variation in endothelial function may also condition or predict the variable response to angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibiting treatment in these individuals has not been addressed before. To study this, 5/6 nephrectomy was performed to induce renal injury and chronic kidney disease in a group of healthy Wistar rats. At the time of nephrectomy, interlobar arteries were obtained from the extirpated right kidney and studied in vitro for endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. Six weeks thereafter, treatment with lisinopril was started (n = 11) and continued for 9 wk. Proteinuria (metabolic cages) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; tail cuff) were evaluated weekly, and these were analyzed in relation to renal endothelial function at baseline. 5/6 Nephrectomy induced an increase in SBP and progressive proteinuria. Treatment with lisinopril reduced SBP and slowed proteinuria, albeit to a variable degree among individuals. The acetylcholine-induced renal artery dilation at baseline negatively correlated with lisinopril-induced reduction of proteinuria (r(2) = 0.648, P = 0.003) and with the decrease in SBP (r(2) = 0.592, P = 0.006). Our data suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor attenuates the progression of renal damage the most in those individuals with decreased basal renal endothelial-mediated vasodilation.</p>

<p>Cardiomyocytes are long-lived post-mitotic cells with limited regenerative capacity. Proper cardiomyocyte function depends critically on the maintenance of a healthy homeostasis of protein expression, folding, assembly, trafficking, function, and degradation, together commonly referred to as proteostasis. Impairment of proteostasis has a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. Emerging evidence reveals also a role for impaired proteostasis in the pathophysiology of common human cardiac diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy, dilated and ischaemic cardiomyopathies, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have recently been recognized as key modulators which control cardiac proteostasis by deacetylating various proteins. By deacetylating chromatin proteins, including histones, HDACs modulate epigenetic regulation of pathological gene expression. Also, HDACs exert a broad range of functions outside the nucleus by deacetylating structural and contractile proteins. The cytosolic actions of HDACs result in changed protein function through post-translational modifications and/or modulation of their degradation. This review describes the mechanisms underlying the derailment of proteostasis in AF and subsequently focuses on the role of HDACs herein. In addition, the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition to maintain a healthy proteostasis resulting in a delay in AF onset and progression is discussed.</p>

<p>Hypothermia and rewarming produces organ injury through the production of reactive oxygen species. We previously found that dopamine prevents hypothermia and rewarming-induced apoptosis in cultured cells through increased expression of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine ß-Synthase (CBS). Here, we investigate whether dopamine protects the kidney in deep body cooling and explore the role of H2S-producing enzymes in an in vivo rat model of deep hypothermia and rewarming. In anesthetized Wistar rats, body temperature was decreased to 15°C for 3h, followed by rewarming for 1h. Rats (n=5 per group) were treated throughout the procedure with vehicle or dopamine infusion, and in the presence or absence of a non-specific inhibitor of H2S-producing enzymes, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA). Kidney damage and renal expression of three H2S-producing enzymes (CBS, CSE and 3-MST) was quantified and serum H2S level measured. Hypothermia and rewarming induced renal damage, evidenced by increased serum creatinine, renal reactive oxygen species production, KIM-1 expression and influx of immune cells, which was accompanied by substantially lowered renal expression of CBS, CSE, and 3-MST and lowered serum H2S levels. Infusion of dopamine fully attenuated renal damage and maintained expression of H2S-producing enzymes, while normalizing serum H2S. AOAA further decreased the expression of H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S level, and aggravated renal damage. Hence, dopamine preserves renal integrity during deep hypothermia and rewarming likely by maintaining the expression of renal H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia is used to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) during organ transplantation and major surgery, but does not fully prevent organ injury. Interestingly, hibernating animals undergo repetitive periods of low body temperature called ‘torpor’ without signs of organ injury. Recently, we identified an essential role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in entrance into torpor and preservation of kidney integrity during hibernation. A torpor-like state can be induced pharmacologically by injecting 5’-Adenosine monophosphate (5’-AMP). The mechanism by which 5’-AMP leads to the induction of a torpor-like state, and the role of H2S herein, remains to be unraveled. Therefore, we investigated whether induction of a torpor-like state by 5-AMP depends on H2S production.METHODS: To study the role of H2S on the induction of torpor, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA), a non-specific inhibitor of H2S, was administered before injection with 5’-AMP to block endogenous H2S production in Syrian hamster. To assess the role of H2S on maintenance of torpor induced by 5’-AMP, additional animals were injected with AOAA during torpor.KEY RESULTS: During the torpor-like state induced by 5’-AMP, the expression of H2S- synthesizing enzymes in the kidneys and plasma levels of H2S were increased. Blockade of these enzymes inhibited the rise in the plasma level of H2S, but neither precluded torpor nor induced arousal. Remarkably, blockade of endogenous H2S production was associated with increased renal injury.CONCLUSIONS: Induction of a torpor-like state by 5’-AMP does not depend on H2S, although production of H2S seems to attenuate renal injury. Unraveling the mechanisms by which 5’-AMP reduces the metabolism without organ injury may allow optimization of current strategies to limit (hypothermic) IRI and improve outcome following organ transplantation, major cardiac and brain surgery.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved program of stress-induced gene expression, aimed at reestablishing protein homeostasis to preserve cellular fitness. Cells that fail to activate or maintain this protective response are hypersensitive to proteotoxic stress. The HSR is mediated by the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which binds to conserved heat shock elements (HSE) in the promoter region of heat shock genes, resulting in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP). Recently, we observed that hyperactivation of RhoA conditions cardiomyocytes for the cardiac arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. Also, the HSR is annihilated in atrial fibrillation, and induction of HSR mitigates sensitization of cells to this disease. Therefore, we hypothesized active RhoA to suppress the HSR resulting in sensitization of cells for proteotoxic stimuli.METHODS AND RESULTS: Stimulation of RhoA activity significantly suppressed the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR in HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes as determined with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the HSF1 regulated human HSP70 (HSPA1A) promoter and HSP protein expression by Western Blot analysis. Inversely, RhoA inhibition boosted the proteotoxic stress-induced HSR. While active RhoA did not preclude HSF1 nuclear accumulation, phosphorylation, acetylation, or sumoylation, it did impair binding of HSF1 to the hsp genes promoter element HSE. Impaired binding results in suppression of HSP expression and sensitized cells to proteotoxic stress.CONCLUSION: These results reveal that active RhoA negatively regulates the HSR via attenuation of the HSF1-HSE binding and thus may play a role in sensitizing cells to proteotoxic stimuli.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Chronic transplant dysfunction (CTD) is the leading cause of long-term loss of the renal allograft. So far, no single test is available to reliably predict the risk for CTD. Monitoring of tryptophan (trp) metabolism through indoleamine 2.3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been previously proposed to predict acute rejection of human kidney transplants. Here, we investigate the potential of IDO/trp degradation along the kynurenine (kyn) pathway to predict the long-term outcome of human kidney transplantation.METHODS: During the 2-year follow-up blood, urine, and kidney biopsies were collected from 48 renal transplant patients. Concentrations of kyn and trp in serum and urine were measured at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after transplantation. Kynurenine to tryptophan ratio was calculated as an estimate of trp degradation. To evaluate the histological changes and IDO expression, respectively, periodic acid schiff staining and immunohistochemistry for IDO were performed on biopsies taken at 6 months and 2 years.RESULTS: Two years after transplantation, kyn/trp was increased in urine and decreased in serum as compared to 2-week values. In 2-year biopsies, IDO expression was mainly found in infiltrating inflammatory cells and in the glomeruli. The urine level of trp 2 weeks after transplantation predicted the serum creatinine 6 months and the estimated creatinine clearance 2 years after transplantation. Additionally, serum level of kyn 6 months after transplantation predicted the serum creatinine 2 years after transplantation.CONCLUSIONS: Early serum and urine levels of trp and kyn may offer a novel route for early detection of patients at risk for developing CTD.</p>

<p>Winter is coming. Some animals successfully cope with the hostility of this season by hibernating. But how do hibernators survive the procoagulant state of months of immobility at very low body temperatures, with strongly decreased blood flow and increased blood viscosity? Changing the coagulation system seems crucial for preventing thromboembolic complications.</p>

<p>It has been firmly established that ageing constitutes a principal risk factor for cardiac disease. Currently, the underlying mechanisms of ageing that contribute to the initiation or acceleration of cardiac disease are essentially unresolved. Prevailing theories of ageing center on the loss of cellular protein homeostasis, by either design (genetically) or “wear and tear” (environmentally). Either or both ways, the normal protein homeostasis in the cell is affected, resulting in aberrant and misfolded proteins. Should such misfolded proteins escape the protein quality control (PQC) system, they become proteotoxic and accelerate the loss of cellular integrity. Impairment of PQC plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ageing-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s, Huntington<U+05F3>s, and Alzheimer<U+05F3>s disease. The concept of an impaired PQC driving ageing-related diseases has recently been expanded to cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyopathy. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the PQC system in relation to ageing and discuss the emerging concept of the loss of PQC in cardiomyocytes as a trigger for cardiac disease. Finally, we discuss the potential of boosting the PQC system as an innovative therapeutic target to treat cardiac disease in the elderly.</p>

<p>The case of a 55-year-old man who attempted suicide by ingesting &lt;100<U+2009>mL of 28% sodium chlorite solution is presented. On arrival in the intensive care unit, the patient appeared cyanotic with lowered consciousness and displayed anuria and chocolate brown serum.Initial laboratory tests revealed 40% of methemoglobin. The formation of methemoglobin was effectively treated with methylene blue (10% after 29 hours).To remove the toxin, and because of the anuric acute renal failure, the patient received renal replacement therapy. Despite these therapeutic measures, the patient developed hemolytic anemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which were treated with red blood cell transfusion and intermittent hemodialysis. These interventions led to the improvement of his condition and the patient eventually fully recovered. Patient gave written informed consent.This is the third known case of chlorite poisoning that has been reported. Based upon this case, we suggest the management of sodium chlorite poisoning to comprise the early administration of methylene blue, in addition to renal replacement therapy and transfusion of red blood cells.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may induce systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) modulates various vascular and immune responses. Here we explored whether agonists of the S1P receptors, FTY720 and SEW2871 improve vascular reactivity after CPB in the rat.METHODS: Experiments were done in male Wistar rats (total n = 127). Anesthesia was induced by isoflurane (2.5-3%) and maintained by fentanyl and midazolam during CPB. After catheterization of the left femoral artery, carotid artery and the right atrium, normothermic extracorporeal circulation was instituted for 60 minutes. In the first part of the study animals were euthanized after either 1 hour, 1 day, 2 or 5 days of the recovery period. In second part of the study animals were euthanized after 1 day of postoperative period. We evaluated the contractile response to phenylephrine (mesenteric arteries) or to serotonin (coronary artery) and vasodilatory response to acethylcholine (both arteries).RESULTS: Contractile responses to phenylephrine were reduced at 1 day recovery after CPB and Sham as compared to healthy control animals (Emax, mN: 7.9 ± 1.9, 6.5 ± 1.5, and 11.3 ± 1.3, respectively). Mainly FTY720, but not SEW2871, caused lymphopenia in both Sham and CPB groups. In coronary and mesenteric arteries, both FTY720 and SEW2871 normalized serotonin and phenylephrine-mediated vascular reactivity after CPB (p&lt;0.05) and FTY720 increased relaxation to acetylcholine as compared with untreated rats that underwent CPB.CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with FTY720 or SEW2871 preserves vascular function in mesenteric and coronary artery after CPB. Therefore, pharmacological activation of S1P1 receptors may provide a promising therapeutic intervention to prevent CPB-related vascular dysfunction in patients.</p>

<p>Hibernation is an energy-conserving behavior in winter characterized by two phases: torpor and arousal. During torpor, markedly reduced metabolic activity results in inactivity and decreased body temperature. Arousal periods intersperse the torpor bouts and feature increased metabolism and euthermic body temperature. Alterations in physiological parameters, such as suppression of hemostasis, are thought to allow hibernators to survive periods of torpor and arousal without organ injury. While the state of torpor is potentially procoagulant, due to low blood flow, increased viscosity, immobility, hypoxia, and low body temperature, organ injury due to thromboembolism is absent. To investigate platelet dynamics during hibernation, we measured platelet count and function during and after natural torpor, pharmacologically induced torpor and forced hypothermia. Splenectomies were performed to unravel potential storage sites of platelets during torpor. Here we show that decreasing body temperature drives thrombocytopenia during torpor in hamster with maintained functionality of circulating platelets. Interestingly, hamster platelets during torpor do not express P-selectin, but expression is induced by treatment with ADP. Platelet count rapidly restores during arousal and rewarming. Platelet dynamics in hibernation are not affected by splenectomy before or during torpor. Reversible thrombocytopenia was also induced by forced hypothermia in both hibernating (hamster) and non-hibernating (rat and mouse) species without changing platelet function. Pharmacological torpor induced by injection of 5’-AMP in mice did not induce thrombocytopenia, possibly because 5’-AMP inhibits platelet function. The rapidness of changes in the numbers of circulating platelets, as well as marginal changes in immature platelet fractions upon arousal, strongly suggest that storage-and-release underlies the reversible thrombocytopenia during natural torpor. Possibly, margination of platelets, dependent on intrinsic platelet functionality, governs clearance of circulating platelets during torpor.</p>

<p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) agonists have been shown to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy, but much less are known about their effects in non-diabetic nephropathies. In the present study, metabolic parameters, blood pressure, aortic endothelial function along with molecular and structural markers of glomerular and tubulointerstitial renal damage, were studied in a rat model of normotensive nephropathy induced by adriamycin and treated with PPAR<U+03B3> agonist pioglitazone (12mg/kg, po), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (1mg/kg, po) or their combination. Pioglitazone had no effect on systolic blood pressure, marginally reduced glycemia and improved aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation. In the kidney, pioglitazone prevented the development of proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis to the similar extent as blood-pressure lowering ramipril. Renoprotection provided by either treatment was associated with a reduction in the cortical expression of profibrotic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and microvascular damage-inducing endothelin-1, and a limitation of interstitial macrophage influx. Treatment with PPAR<U+03B3> agonist, as well as ACE inhibitor comparably affected renal expression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, normalizing increased renal expression of ACE and enhancing the expression of Mas receptor. Interestingly, combined pioglitazone and ramipril treatment did not provide any additional renoprotection. These results demonstrate that in a nondiabetic renal disease, such as adriamycin-induced nephropathy, PPAR<U+03B3> agonist pioglitazone provides renoprotection to a similar extent as an ACE inhibitor by interfering with the expression of local RAS components and attenuating related profibrotic and inflammatory mechanisms. The combination of the both agents, however, does not lead to any additional renal benefit.</p>

<p>Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is the main contributor to the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the brain. Exogenously administered H2S has been reported to protect neurons against hypoxic injury, ischemia and LPS-induced neuro-inflammation and in the facilitating of long term potentiation (LTP). Dysregulation of CBS leads to different diseases, which all have mental retardation in common. Although multiple studies have implicated a link between the CBS/H2S pathway and neurodegeneration, no studies have been performed examining the pathway in healthy aging animals. We hypothesize that CBS/H2S pathway plays an important role in the protection of learning and memory functions in the brain at the level of the hippocampus. Thus, we studied a set of 8 young (4 months) and 14 aged (24 months (n=6) and 28 months (n=8)) C57Bl6 mice. The 24-month-old mice displayed a significant decrease of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG only, compared to 4-month-old mice. In 28-month-old mice, we observed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG, compared to 4-month-old mice. When comparing 28-month-old mice to 24-month-old mice, all areas showed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity. Thus, throughout aging, CBS expression is maintained in the hippocampus, and many other forebrain regions as well. Mice at the unusual age of 28 months even have a higher hippocampal CBS expression than young mice. Maintenance (and increase) of CBS levels may sustain memory and learning by precluding neuronal loss in areas of the hippocampus.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Diabetes and particularly high blood glucose levels are implicated in neurodegeneration. One of the hallmarks of neurodegeneration is protein aggregation. We investigated the presence of protein aggregation in the frontal brain of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, an animal model for diabetes. Further, the effect of NaHS in suppressing protein aggregation in cultured brain slices from ZDF was assessed.RESULTS: The levels of protein synthesis, protein/gene expression, autophagy and anti-oxidant defense were evaluated in ZDF and control (Lean) brains.Compared to Lean, ZDF brains displayed a significant increase in protein aggregates, p-tau, fibronectin expression and protein glycosylation. Increased phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 ribosomal protein in ZDF indicated higher protein synthesis, while the increase in ubiquitinated proteins and LC3-I in ZDF brains accompanied by lower LC3-II expression and LC3-II/LC3-I levels indicated the blockage of proteolytic pathways. CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) protein and mRNA expression and thiol group levels in ZDF brains were lower compared to Lean. ZDF brains show a higher level of reactive oxygen species. In vitro NaHS treatment normalized proteostasis while counteracting oxidative stress.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate increased protein synthesis and aggregation in the diabetic ZDF rat brain, which was reversible by NaHS treatment.This is the first report on the potential use of NaHS as a novel strategy against protein aggregation in diabetic brain.</p>

<p>Ultrasound and microbubble-targeted delivery (UMTD) is a promising non-viral technique for genetic-based therapy. We found that UMTD of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is more effective than delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA). UMTD (1 MHz, 0.22 MPa) of fluorescently labeled siRNA resulted in 97.9 ± 1.5% transfected cells, with siRNA localized homogenously in the cytoplasm directly after ultrasound exposure. UMTD of fluorescently labeled pDNA resulted in only 43.0 ± 4.2% transfected cells, with localization mainly in vesicular structures, co-localizing with endocytosis markers clathrin and caveolin. Delivery of siRNA against GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) effectively decreased protein levels to 24.3 ± 7.9% of non-treated controls (p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, 24 h after delivery of pDNA encoding GAPDH, no increase in protein levels was detected. Transfection efficiency, verified with red fluorescently labeled pDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein, revealed that of the transfected cells, only 2.0 ± 0.7% expressed the transgene. In conclusion, the difference in localization between siRNA and pDNA after UMTD is an important determinant of the effectiveness of these genetic-based technologies.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: We investigated endothelial dysfunction and the role of angiotensin (Ang)-II type I (AT1-R) and type II (AT2-R) receptor in the changes in the Ang-II sensitivity in experimental preeclampsia in the rat.METHODS: Aortic rings were isolated from low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infused pregnant rats (experimental preeclampsia; n=9), saline-infused pregnant rats (n=8), and saline (n=8) and LPS (n=8) infused non-pregnant rats. Endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was studied in phenylephrine-preconstricted aortic rings in the presence of vehicle, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and/or indomethacin. To evaluate the role for AT1-R and AT2-R in Ang-II sensitivity, full concentration response curves were obtained for Ang-II in the presence of losartan or PD123319. mRNA expression of the AT1-R and AT2-R, eNOS and iNOS, COX1 and COX2 in aorta were evaluated using real-time RT-PCR.RESULTS: The role of vasodilator prostaglandins in the aorta was increased and the role of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and response of the AT1-R and AT2-R to Ang-II was decreased in pregnant saline infused rats as compared with non-pregnant rats. These changes were not observed during preeclampsia.CONCLUSION: Pregnancy induced adaptations in endothelial function, which were not observed in the rat model for preeclampsia. This role of lack of pregnancy induced endothelial adaptation in the pathophysiology of experimental preeclampsia needs further investigation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by structural remodeling, contractile dysfunction, and AF progression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence acetylation of both histones and cytosolic proteins, thereby mediating epigenetic regulation and influencing cell proteostasis. Because the exact function of HDACs in AF is unknown, we investigated their role in experimental and clinical AF models.METHODS AND RESULTS: Tachypacing of HL-1 atrial cardiomyocytes and Drosophila pupae hearts significantly impaired contractile function (amplitude of Ca(2+) transients and heart wall contractions). This dysfunction was prevented by inhibition of HDAC6 (tubacin) and sirtuins (nicotinamide). Tachypacing induced specific activation of HDAC6, resulting in a-tubulin deacetylation, depolymerization, and degradation by calpain. Tachypacing-induced contractile dysfunction was completely rescued by dominant-negative HDAC6 mutants with loss of deacetylase activity in the second catalytic domain, which bears a-tubulin deacetylase activity. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubastatin A protected atrial tachypaced dogs from electric remodeling (action potential duration shortening, L-type Ca(2+) current reduction, AF promotion) and cellular Ca(2+)-handling/contractile dysfunction (loss of Ca(2+) transient amplitude, sarcomere contractility). Finally, atrial tissue from patients with AF also showed a significant increase in HDAC6 activity and reduction in the expression of both acetylated and total a-tubulin.CONCLUSIONS: AF induces remodeling and loss of contractile function, at least in part through HDAC6 activation and subsequent derailment of a-tubulin proteostasis and disruption of the cardiomyocyte microtubule structure. In vivo inhibition of HDAC6 protects against AF-related atrial remodeling, disclosing the potential of HDAC6 as a therapeutic target in clinical AF.</p>
