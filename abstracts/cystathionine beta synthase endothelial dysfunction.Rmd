STUDY OBJECTIVE: A phase 1/2 clinical trial was performed in individuals with cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) deficient homocystinuria with aims to: (a) assess pharmacokinetics and safety of taurine therapy, (b) evaluate oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular function in CBS deficiency, and (c) evaluate the impact of short-term taurine treatment.METHODS: Individuals with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency with homocysteine &gt;50<U+2009>µM, without inflammatory disorder or on antioxidant therapy were enrolled. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]), and disease-related metabolites obtained at baseline were compared to normal values. While maintaining current treatment, patients were treated with 75<U+2009>mg/kg taurine twice daily, and treatment response assessed after 4 hours and 4 days.RESULTS: Fourteen patients (8-35<U+2009>years; 8 males, 6 females) were enrolled with baseline homocysteine levels 161<U+2009>±<U+2009>67<U+2009>µM. The study found high-dose taurine to be safe when excluding preexisting hypertriglyceridemia. Taurine pharmacokinetics showed a rapid peak level returning to near normal levels at 12<U+2009>hours, but had slow accumulation and elevated predosing levels after 4 days of treatment. Only a single parameter of oxidative stress, 2,3-dinor-8-isoprostaglandin-F2a, was elevated at baseline, with no elevated inflammatory parameters, and no change in FMD values overall. Taurine had no effect on any of these parameters. However, the effect of taurine was strongly related to pretreatment FMD values; and taurine significantly improved FMD in the subset of individuals with pretreatment FMD values &lt;10% and in individuals with homocysteine levels &gt;125<U+2009>µM, pertinent to endothelial function.CONCLUSION: Taurine improves endothelial function in CBS-deficient homocystinuria in patients with preexisting reduced function.

The combination of traditional Chinese medicines can improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. Furthermore, the combination of the traditional Chinese medicine curcuma zedoary and kelp was used to enhance the effect of the dissipation of blood stasis in pediatrics during the Song Dynasty. Curcumenol and laminarin, the main components of curcuma zedoary and kelp, are also reported to have a wide range of biological activities. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp may prevent the development of cancer. The aim of this research was to confirm whether a combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of hepatoma cells and consequently improve prognosis. In this study, we firstly found in H22-bearing mice that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp inhibited tumor growth and the expression of metastasis-related proteins (MMPs, VEGF, pAkt, pERK1/2). Meanwhile, the decreased cystathionine beta synthase (CBS, an endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthetase) level was also observed in H22-bearing mice admistrated with the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp. It was also observed that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the potential inhibiting mechanism of the combination of curcumenol and laminarin on HepG2 cell proliferation and metastasis. Our previous research showed that a CBS/H2S system was vital for maintaining the proliferation in hepatoma cells. Here, we found that the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 were decreased in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells and the combination of curcumenol and laminarin significantly decreased the H2S level in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 in HepG2 cells. Angiogenesis, positively regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is essential for human cancer metastasis. In the present study, we found that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin could significantly down-regulate the expression levels of VEGF and its downstream key genes pAkt and pERK1/2. Furthermore, previous research showed that hydrogen sulfide could stimulate angiogenesis. Here, we also observed the reduction of the VEGF, Akt, pAkt, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 proteins levels and the inhibition of proliferation and metastasis in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells. Moreover, exogenous H2S rescued the cytological results caused by the combination of curcumenol and laminarin. Taken together, the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting endogenous H2S production and down-regulating the pSTAT3/BCL-2 and VEGF pathway, which provides strong evidence for the application of curcuma zedoary and kelp in treatments of liver cancer.

AIMS: The induction of excessive autophagy by increased levels of oxidative stress is one of the main mechanisms underlying unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to have an anti-oxidative effect, but its mode of action on excessive autophagy in vascular endothelial cells is unclear.METHODS: Surgery was used to induce UUO in male C57BL/6 mice as an in vivo model. Human renal epithelial cells (HK-2) were treated with H2O2 as an in vitro model. NaHS was used as an exogenous H2S donor. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to observe the structure of renal autophagosomes. The expression of proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis was detected by western blot analysis in vivo and in vitro. Flow cytometry (DCFH-DA) was used to examine the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to detect cell apoptosis. Compound C was used to analyze the association of AMPK with autophagy.RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, in which the ureter was exposed but not ligated, the cell apoptosis index, number of autophagosomes, protein expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (LC3)-II/I, beclin-1, and p-AMPK/AMPK were significantly increased in the UUO group. On the other hand, p62, cystathionine ß-synthase, and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase protein expression levels and H2S concentration were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). These alterations were ameliorated by the addition of NaHS (p &lt; 0.05). Similar results were observed in vitro. By using the AMPK inhibitor compound C, it was indicated that AMPK was involved in ROS-induced autophagy. In addition, using tissue from patients with obstructive nephropathy, excessive autophagy was observed by an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.CONCLUSION: NaHS-treatment may exert a protective effect on mouse kidney against UUO by suppressing the ROS-AMPK pathway. ROS-AMPK-mediated autophagy may represent a promising therapeutic target for obstructive nephropathy.

Hyper- and hypothyroidism are some of the most common endocrinopathies that cause many metabolic disorders including amino acids metabolism. However, a specific molecular mechanism of thyroid hormones influence on sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism has not been established. The aim of our research was to investigate experimentally the influence of thyroid gland functional state on the main enzymatic systems of sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism in liver and kidneys, the content of homocysteine, cysteine and H2S in blood. The rats were administered with L-thyroxine and mercazolil to simulate the states of hyper- and hypothyroidism, which were confirmed by the content of fT3, fT4 and TSH in the blood. In liver and kidneys of the animals with hypothyroidism we observed the decrease in the activity of enzymes of remethylation cycle of S-adenosylmethioninsyntase, S-adenosylhomocysteinhyhdrolase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. Suppression of transsulfuration transformation of homocysteine to cysteine in hypothyroidism was mainly due to the inhibition of cystathionine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase, wherein cystathionase activity of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase was not changed. In animals with hypothyroidism we also noticed the inhibition of cysteine desulfunation reactions: the activity of enzymes of cystathionine-ß-synthase, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase and cysteine aminotransferase significantly decreased in liver and kidneys. Experimental hyperthyroidism was accompanied by increase in activity of remethylation cycle enzymes, increase in cystationine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase in liver and activity of these enzymes in kidneys. The simulation of hyperthyroidism led to the decrease of homocysteine concentration, and of hypothyroidism - to the increase of homocysteine and cysteine concentrations and reduced H2S content in blood of the animals. Thus, the significant risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulation in hypothyroid conditions may be the disorders in the processes of remethylation, transsulfuration, and desulfuration of sulphur-containing amino acids in organs.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with several human visual disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is linked to vision loss in DR and AMD. Our previous work revealed that HHcy altered BRB in retinal endothelial cells in vivo. Here we hypothesize that homocysteine (Hcy) alters retinal endothelial cell barrier function and angiogenic potential via activation of oxidative stress. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) treated with and without different concentrations of Hcy showed a reduction of tight junction protein expression, increased FITC dextran leakage, decreased transcellular electrical resistance and increased angiogenic potential. In addition, HRECs treated with Hcy showed increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduced ROS formation and decreased FITC-dextran leakage in Hcy treated HRECs. A mouse model of HHcy, in which cystathionine-ß-synthase is deficient (cbs <sup>-/-</sup>), was evaluated for oxidative stress by dichlolorofluorescein (DCF), dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. There was a marked increase in ROS production and augmented GSH reductase and antioxidant regulator NRF2 activity, but decreased antioxidant gene expression in retinas of hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Our results suggest activation of oxidative stress as a possible mechanism of HHcy induced retinal endothelial cell dysfunction.

METHODS: Anesthetized and instrumented FBM &quot;familial hypercholesterolemia Bretoncelles Meishan&quot; pigs with high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were subjected to polymicrobial septic shock, or sham procedure, and subsequent intensive care therapy for 24 h. Young German domestic pigs were used as naïve controls. CSE, CBS, 3-MST, HO-1, eNOS, and nitrotyrosine expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin sections.RESULTS: FBM pigs, in the absence of septic shock, showed decreased CSE expression in the media. This decrease became more pronounced after sepsis. The expression pattern of HO-1 resembled the pattern of CSE expression. CBS protein was not detected in the media of any of the CA examined but was localized to the adventitia and only in the atheromatous plaques containing foam cells of the CA, in regions that also displayed abundant nitrotyrosine formation. The CBS expression in the adventitia was not associated with nitrotyrosine formation. 3-MST expression was not found in any of the CA samples.CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that (i) the reduced CSE expression in FBM pigs may contribute to their cardiovascular disease phenotype and moreover (ii) the further decrease in CA CSE expression in sepsis may contribute to the sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction.

Cirrhosis is a end-stage disease of the liver in which fibrogenesis, angiogenesis and distortion of intrahepatic microcirculation lead to increased intrahepatic resistance to portal blood flow, a condition known as portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is maintained by a variety of molecular mechanisms including sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) hyporeactivity, activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), reduction in hepatic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity along with increased eNOS-derived NO generation in the splanchnic and systemic circulations. A reduction of the expression/function of the two major hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), has also been demonstrated. A deficit in the transsulfuration pathway leading to the accumulation of homocysteine might contribute to defective generation of H2S and endothelial hyporeactivity. Bile acids are ligands for nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the G-protein bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1). FXR and GPBAR1 ligands regulate the expression/activity of CSE by both genomic and non-genomic effects and have been proved effective in protecting against endothelial dysfunction observed in rodent models of cirrhosis. GPBAR1, a receptor for secondary bile acids, is selectively expressed by LSECs and its activation increases the expression of CSE and attenuates the production of endotelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor agent. In vivo GPBAR1 ligand attenuates the imbalance between vasodilatory and vaso-constricting agents, making GPBAR1 a promising target in the treatment of portal hypertension.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. The use of vitamins to modulate homocysteine metabolism substantially lowers the risk by reducing plasma homocysteine levels. In this study, we evaluated the effects of l-serine and related amino acids on homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and endothelial cell damage using EA.hy926 human endothelial cells. Homocysteine treatment decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, which were reversed by cotreatment with l-serine. l-Serine inhibited homocysteine-induced ER stress as verified by decreased glucose-regulated protein 78kDa (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression as well as X-box binding protein 1 (xbp1) mRNA splicing. The effects of l-serine on homocysteine-induced ER stress are not attributed to intracellular homocysteine metabolism, but instead to decreased homocysteine uptake. Glycine exerted effects on homocysteine-induced ER stress, apoptosis, and cell viability that were comparable to those of l-serine. Although glycine did not affect homocysteine uptake or export, coincubation of homocysteine with glycine for 24h reduced the intracellular concentration of homocysteine. Taken together, l-serine and glycine cause homocysteine-induced endothelial cell damage by reducing the level of intracellular homocysteine. l-Serine acts by competitively inhibiting homocysteine uptake in the cells. However, the mechanism(s) by which glycine lowers homocysteine levels are unclear.

Anemia of end stage renal disease affects 90% of patients on hemodialysis and it is a tremendous concern of patients and health care providers. Renal disease creates a state of renal hypoxia, which may contribute to a lack of erythropoietin production from the kidney when low oxygen levels are sensed. This necessitates the use of exogenous erythropoietin preparations.</AbstractText>: Anemia of end stage renal disease affects 90% of patients on hemodialysis and it is a tremendous concern of patients and health care providers. Renal disease creates a state of renal hypoxia, which may contribute to a lack of erythropoietin production from the kidney when low oxygen levels are sensed. This necessitates the use of exogenous erythropoietin preparations.Recent evidence suggests that endogenously derived hydrogen sulfide may mediate oxygen sensing in tissues. Given the known involvement of other small molecules such as nitric oxide in erythropoietin production and the observation of decreased urinary H2S levels in patients with renal failure, we postulated that H2S may be the primary mediator of erythropoietin production during hypoxia. PK1, 786-O and Hep3B cells were incubated in hypoxia (1% O2) for 24 hours. Hypoxic cells were treated with the H2S donor GYY 4137 and the H2S inhibitor hydroxylamine. Following hypoxia erythropoietin, HIF-1a, HIF-2a and CBS expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.</AbstractText>: Recent evidence suggests that endogenously derived hydrogen sulfide may mediate oxygen sensing in tissues.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter. The levels of H2S-generating enzyme expression and endogenous H2S production in diabetic rats with erectile dysfunction (ED) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the H2S-generating enzymes and endogenous production of H2S in penile tissues of diabetic ED rats.METHODS: Experimental rats were randomly divided into normal control group, apomorphine (APO)-positive group and APO-negative group. Primary rat corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) and aortic endothelial cells (AECs) were isolated and cultured in vitro under 3 different conditions: normal glucose (NG) condition, high glucose (HG) condition, and osmotic control (OC) condition.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile function; H2S concentrations in plasma or penile tissues; expression of H2S-generating enzymes and endogenous H2S production in penile tissues, CCSMCs, and AECs.RESULTS: Erectile function was significantly decreasedin the APO-negative group. In addition to significantly decreased expression of cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), d-amino acid oxidase (DAO), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), the H2S concentrations in plasma and penile tissues and endogenous H2S production were significantly decreased in the APO-negative group. Endogenous H2S production by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) decreased to the same levels in the APO-negative and APO-positive groups as that in the normal control group. However, CBS and CSE expression remained unchanged in the 3 groups. Under HG conditions, H2S-generating enzyme expression in AECs did not change, while CAT, DAO, and 3-MST expression in CCSMCs was significantly decreased. In both cell types, H2S production by these enzymes was decreased in the HG group.CONCLUSION: Endogenous H2S production was significantly decreased in the diabetic ED rats' penile tissues due to downregulated expression of the CAT/3-MST and DAO/3-MST pathways and low activities of CBS and CSE.

INTRODUCTION: Resveratrol (RVT) found in red wine protects against erectile dysfunction and relaxes penile tissue (corpus cavernosum) via a nitric oxide (NO) independent pathway. However, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a potent vasodilator and neuromodulator generated in corpus cavernosum.AIMS: We investigated whether RVT caused the relaxation of mice corpus cavernosum (MCC) through H2 S.METHODS: H2 S formation is measured by methylene blue assay and vascular reactivity experiments have been performed by DMT strip myograph in CD1 MCC strips.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N<U+03C9>-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 0.1<U+2009>mM) or H2 S inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA, 2<U+2009>mM) which inhibits both cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) enzyme or combination of AOAA with PAG (CSE inhibitor) has been used in the presence/absence of RVT (0.1<U+2009>mM, 30<U+2009>min) to elucidate the role of NO or H2 S pathways on the effects of RVT in MCC. Concentration-dependent relaxations to RVT, L-cysteine, sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) and acetylcholine (ACh) were studied.RESULTS: Exposure of murine corpus cavernosum to RVT increased both basal and L-cysteine-stimulated H2 S formation. Both of these effects were reversed by AOAA but not by L-NNA. RVT caused concentration-dependent relaxation of MCC and that RVT-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG but not by L-NNA. L-cysteine caused concentration-dependent relaxations, which are inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG significantly. Incubation of MCC with RVT significantly increased L-cysteine-induced relaxation, and this effect was inhibited by AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG. However, RVT did not alter the effect of exogenous H2 S (NaHS) or ACh-induced relaxations.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that RVT-induced relaxation is at least partly dependent on H2 S formation and acts independent of eNOS pathway. In phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) nonresponder population, combination therapy with RVT may reverse erectile dysfunction via stimulating endogenous H2 S formation.

Deficiencies of the human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) enzyme are characterized by a plethora of vascular disorders and hyperhomocysteinemia. However, several clinical trials demonstrated that despite reduction in homocysteine levels, disease outcome remained unaffected, thus the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is poorly defined. Here, we show that the loss of CBS function in endothelial cells (ECs) leads to a significant down-regulation of cellular hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by 50% and of glutathione (GSH) by 40%. Silencing CBS in ECs compromised phenotypic and signaling responses to the VEGF that were potentiated by decreased transcription of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and neuropilin (NRP)-1, the primary receptors regulating endothelial function. Transcriptional down-regulation of VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 was mediated by a lack in stability of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which is a sulfhydration target of H2S at residues Cys68 and Cys755. Reinstating H2S but not GSH in CBS-silenced ECs restored Sp1 levels and its binding to the VEGFR-2 promoter and VEGFR-2, NRP-1 expression, VEGF-dependent proliferation, and migration phenotypes. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of CBS-mediated protein S-sulfhydration in maintaining vascular health and function.-Saha, S., Chakraborty, P. K., Xiong, X., Dwivedi, S. K. D., Mustafi, S.

In this chapter the role played by H2S in the physiopathology of urogenital tract revising animal and human data available in the current relevant literature is discussed. H2S pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the mechanism underlying penile erection in human and experimental animal. Both cystathionine-ß synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3> lyase (CSE) are expressed in the human corpus cavernosum and exogenous H2S relaxes isolated human corpus cavernosum strips in an endothelium-independent manner. Hydrogen sulfide pathway also accounts for the direct vasodilatory effect operated by testosterone on isolated vessels. Convincing evidence suggests that H2S can influence the cGMP pathway by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) activity. All these findings taken together suggest an important role for the H2S pathway in human corpus cavernosum homeostasis. However, H2S effect is not confined to human corpus cavernosum but also plays an important role in human bladder. Human bladder expresses mainly CBS and generates in vitro detectable amount of H2S. In addition the bladder relaxant effect of the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil involves H2S as mediator. In conclusion the H2S pathway is not only involved in penile erection but also plays a role in bladder homeostasis. In addition the finding that it involved in the mechanism of action of PDE-5 inhibitors strongly suggests that modulation of this pathway can represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and bladder diseases.

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (Hcy) level is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). During transsulfuration pathways, Hcy is metabolized into hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is a synaptic modulator, as well as a neuro-protective agent. However, the role of hydrogen sulfide, as well as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and synaptic dysfunction, leading to AD pathology is not clear. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibition of neuronal NMDA-R by H2S and MK801 mitigate the Hcy-induced BBB disruption and synapse dysfunction, in part by decreasing neuronal matrix degradation. Hcy intracerebral (IC) treatment significantly impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral circulation and memory function. Hcy treatment also decreases the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the brain along with increased expression of NMDA-R (NR1) and synaptosomal Ca(2+) indicating excitotoxicity. Additionally, we found that Hcy treatment increased protein and mRNA expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 and also increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in the brain. The increased expression of ICAM-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and claudin-5 indicates BBB disruption and vascular inflammation. Moreover, we also found decreased expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP-97), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), synaptophysin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) showing synapse dysfunction in the hippocampus. Furthermore, NaHS and MK801 treatment ameliorates BBB disruption, CBF, and synapse functions in the mice brain. These results demonstrate a neuro-protective effect of H2S over Hcy-induced cerebrovascular pathology through the NMDA receptor. Our present study clearly signifies the therapeutic ramifications of H2S for cerebrovascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Graphical Abstract <U+115F>.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) impairs re-endothelialization and accelerates vascular remodeling. The role of CD34(+)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2(+) progenitor cells (PCs) in vascular repair in HHcy is unknown. We studied the effect of HHcy on PCs and its role in vascular repair in severe HHcy (~150 µM), which was induced in cystathionine-ß synthase heterozygous mice fed a high-methionine diet for 8 weeks. Vascular injury was introduced by carotid air-dry endothelium denudation. CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells were examined by flow cytometry. HHcy reduced bone marrow (BM) CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells and suppressed replenishment of postinjury CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells in peripheral blood (PB). Donor green fluorescent protein-positive PC homing to the injured vessel was reduced in HHcy after CD34(+) PCs from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice were adoptively transferred following carotid injury. CD34(+) PC transfusion partially reversed HHcy-suppressed re-endothelialization and HHcy-induced neointimal formation. Furthermore, homocysteine (Hcy) inhibited proliferation, adhesion, and migration and suppressed ß1-integrin expression and activity in human CD34(+) endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) isolated from PBs in a dose-dependent manner. A functional-activating ß1-integrin antibody rescued Hcy-suppressed adhesion and migration in CD34(+) ECFCs. In conclusion, HHcy reduces BM CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) generation and suppresses CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cell mobilization and homing to the injured vessel via ß1-integrin inhibition, which partially contributes to impaired re-endothelialization and vascular remodeling.

AIM: To evaluate the effect of ginkgolide B treatment on vascular endothelial function in diabetic rats.METHODS: The study included four groups with 15 male Sprague-Dawley rats: control group; control group treated with ginkgolide B; diabetic group; and diabetic treated with ginkgolide B. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde content, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits, and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) protein expression were determined in aortic tissues. Vasoconstriction to phenylephrine (PHE) and vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were assessed in aortic rings. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were measured, as well as cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß synthetase (CBS) protein expression, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity.RESULTS: Diabetes significantly impaired PHE-induced vasoconstriction and Ach-induced vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), reduced NO bioavailability and H2S production (P&lt;0.001), SOD activity, and GPX1 protein expression (P&lt;0.001), and increased malondialdehyde content and NADPH oxidase subunits, and CSE and CBS protein expression (P&lt;0.001). Ginkgolide B treatment improved PHE vasoconstriction and Ach vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), restored SOD (P=0.005) and eNOS (P&lt;0.001) activities, H2S production (P=0.044) and decreased malondialdehyde content (P=0.014). Vasorelaxation to SNP was not signi<U+FB01>cantly different in control and diabetic rats with or without ginkgolide B treatment. Besides, ginkgolide B increased GPX1 protein expression and reduced NADPH oxidase subunits, CBS and CSE protein expression.CONCLUSION: Ginkgolide B alleviates endothelial dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and elevating NO bioavailability and H2S production in diabetic rats.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertension is a common clinical problem still poorly understood. The presence of GC receptor (GR) in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells suggests a direct role for GC in vasculature. In response to hemodynamic shear stress, endothelium tonically releases nitric oxide (NO), endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and prostacyclin contributing to vascular homeostasis. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been proposed as a candidate for EDHF. H2S is endogenously mainly formed from L-cysteine by the action of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). It plays many physiological roles and contributes to cardiovascular function. Here we have evaluated the role played by H2S in mesenteric arterial bed and in carotid artery harvested from rats treated with vehicle or dexamethasone (DEX; 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. During treatments systolic blood pressure was significantly increased in conscious rats. EDHF contribution was evaluated in ex-vivo by performing a concentration-response curve induced by acetylcholine (Ach) in presence of a combination of indomethacin and L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester in both vascular districts. EDHF-mediated relaxation was significantly reduced in DEX-treated group in both mesenteric bed and carotid artery. EDHF-mediated relaxation was abolished by pre-treatment with both apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of small and big calcium-dependent potassium channels respectively, or with propargylglycine, inhibitor of CSE. Western blot analysis revealed a marked reduction in CBS and CSE expression as well as H2S production in homogenates of mesenteric arterial bed and carotid artery from DEX-treated rats. In parallel, H2S plasma levels were significantly reduced in DEX group compared with vehicle. In conclusion, an impairment in EDHF/H2S signaling occurs in earlier state of GC-induced hypertension in rats suggesting that counteracting this dysfunction may be beneficial to manage DEX-associated increase in blood pressure.

Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are positively correlated with cardiovascular mortality in diabetes. However, the joint effect of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and hyperglycemia (HG) on endothelial dysfunction (ED) and the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. Mild (22 µmol/L) and moderate (88 µmol/L) HHcy were induced in cystathionine ß-synthase wild-type (Cbs(+/+)) and heterozygous-deficient (Cbs(-/+)) mice by a high-methionine (HM) diet. HG was induced by consecutive injection of streptozotocin. We found that HG worsened HHcy and elevated Hcy levels to 53 and 173 µmol/L in Cbs(+/+) and Cbs(-/+) mice fed an HM diet, respectively. Both mild and moderate HHcy aggravated HG-impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation to acetylcholine, which was completely abolished by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. HHcy potentiated HG-induced calpain activation in aortic endothelial cells isolated from Cbs mice. Calpain inhibitors rescued HHcy- and HHcy/HG-induced ED in vivo and ex vivo. Moderate HHcy- and HG-induced µ-calpain activation was potentiated by a combination of HHcy and HG in the mouse aorta. µ-Calpain small interfering RNA (µ-calpsiRNA) prevented HHcy/HG-induced ED in the mouse aorta and calpain activation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with DL-Hcy (500 µmol/L) and d-glucose (25 mmol) for 48 h. In addition, HHcy accelerated HG-induced superoxide production as determined by dihydroethidium and 3-nitrotyrosin staining and urinary 8-isoprostane/creatinine assay. Antioxidants rescued HHcy/HG-induced ED in mouse aortas and calpain activation in cultured HAECs. Finally, HHcy potentiated HG-suppressed nitric oxide production and eNOS activity in HAECs, which were prevented by calpain inhibitors or µ-calpsiRNA. HHcy aggravated HG-increased phosphorylation of eNOS at threonine 497/495 (eNOS-pThr497/495) in the mouse aorta and HAECs. HHcy/HG-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 was reversed by µ-calpsiRNA and adenoviral transduced dominant negative protein kinase C (PKC)ß2 in HAECs. HHcy and HG induced ED, which was potentiated by the combination of HHcy and HG via µ-calpain/PKCß2 activation-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 and eNOS inactivation.

High level of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia, HHcy) is associated with increased risk for vascular disease. Evidence for this emerges from epidemiological studies which show that HHcy is associated with premature peripheral, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease independent of other risk factors. Possible mechanisms by which homocysteine causes vascular injury include endothelial injury, DNA dysfunction, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, increased oxidative stress, reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase and promoting inflammation. HHcy has been shown to cause direct damage to endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, this manifests as impaired flow-mediated vasodilation and is mainly due to a reduction in nitric oxide synthesis and bioavailability. The effect of impaired nitric oxide release can in turn trigger and potentiate atherothrombogenesis and oxidative stress. Endothelial damage is a crucial aspect of atherosclerosis and precedes overt manifestation of disease. In addition, endothelial dysfunction is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, ischemia reperfusion injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Homocysteine is a precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is formed by transulfuration process catalyzed by the enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. H2S is a gasotransmitter that has emerged recently as a novel mediator in cardiovascular homeostasis. As a potent vasodilator, it plays several roles which include regulation of vessel diameter, protection of endothelium from redox stress, ischemia reperfusion injury and chronic inflammation. However, the precise mechanism by which it mediates these beneficial effects is complex and still remains unclear. Current evidence indicates H2S modulates cellular functions by a variety of intracellular signaling processes. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of HHcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and the metabolism and physiological functions of H2S as a protective agent.

Increased blood level of homocysteine (Hcy), called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) accompanies many cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that HHcy-enhanced cerebrovascular permeability occurs via activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and leads to an increased formation of fibrinogen-ß-amyloid (Fg-Aß) complex. Cerebrovascular permeability changes were assessed in C57BL/6J (wild type, WT), cystathionine-ß-synthase heterozygote (Cbs+/-, a genetic model of HHcy), MMP9 gene knockout (Mmp9-/-), and Cbs and Mmp9 double knockout (Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/-) mice using a dual-tracer probing method. Expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and Fg-Aß complex formation was assessed in mouse brain cryosections by immunohistochemistry. Short-term memory of mice was assessed with a novel object recognition test. The cerebrovascular permeability in Cbs+/- mice was increased via mainly the paracellular transport pathway. VE-cadherin expression was the lowest and Fg-Aß complex formation was the highest along with the diminished short-term memory in Cbs+/- mice. These effects of HHcy were ameliorated in Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/- mice. Thus, HHcy causes activation of MMP9 increasing cerebrovascular permeability by downregulation of VE-cadherin resulting in an enhanced formation of Fg-Aß complex that can be associated with loss of memory. These data may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention that can modulate HHcy-induced cerebrovascular permeability and resultant pathologies.

Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is maintained by the cross-talk of endothelial cells, junction proteins, and neurogliovascular network, the epigenetic mechanisms behind BBB permeability are largely unknown. We are reporting for the first time miR29b-mediated regulation of BBB, which is a novel mechanism underlying BBB integrity. We hypothesize that miR29b regulates BBB dysfunction by regulating DNMT3b, which consequently regulates the levels of metalloproteinases, that can eat up the membrane and junction proteins leading to leaky vasculature. In addition, 5'-azacytidine (5'-aza) was used to test its efficacy on BBB permeability. Blood-brain barrier disruption model was created by using homocysteine, and in the models miR29b was identified to be most affected, by using microRNA RT(2)-qPCR array. MiR29b mimics and inhibitors also confirmed that miR29b regulates the levels DNMT3b and MMP9. In hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine-ß-synthase deficient (CBS(+/-)) mice with high brain vessel permeability, miR29b levels were also high as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, 5'-aza improved BBB permeability by decreasing the expression of miR29b. In conclusion, our data suggested miR29b-mediated regulation of BBB dysfunction through DNMT3b and MMP9. It also potentiates the use of microRNAs as candidates for future epigenetic therapies in the improvement of BBB integrity.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is prevalent in patients with hypertension and is an independent risk factor for aortic pathologies. HHcy is known to cause an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), leading to the accumulation of collagen in the aorta and resulting in stiffness and development of hypertension. Although the exact mechanism of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is unclear, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic regulation involving DNA methylation. Our purpose was to investigate whether 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) inhibitor, reduces high blood pressure (BP) by regulating aortic ECM remodeling in HHcy. Wild-type and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)(+/-) HHcy mice were treated with Aza (0.5 mg/kg body weight). In HHcy mice, Aza treatment normalized the plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and BP. Thoracic and abdominal aorta ultrasound revealed a reduction in the resistive index and wall-to-lumen ratio. Vascular response to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside improved after Aza in HHcy mice. Histology showed a marked reduction in collagen deposition in the aorta. Aza treatment decreased the expression of DNMT1, MMP9, TIMP1, and S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and upregulated methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). We conclude that reduction of DNA methylation by Aza in HHcy reduces adverse aortic remodeling to mitigate hypertension.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with elderly frailty, skeletal muscle injury and malfunction, reduced vascular integrity and function, and mortality. Although HHcy has been implicated in the impairment of angiogenesis after hindlimb ischemia in murine models, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We hypothesized that HHcy compromises skeletal muscle perfusion, collateral formation, and arteriogenesis by diminishing postischemic vasculogenic responses in muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we created femoral artery ligation in wild-type and heterozygous cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS(+/-)) mice (a model for HHcy) and assessed tissue perfusion, collateral vessel formation, and skeletal muscle function using laser-Doppler perfusion imaging, barium angiography, and fatigue tests. In addition, we assessed postischemic levels of VEGF and levels of its muscle-specific regulators: hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator (PGC)-1a. The observations indicated dysregulation of VEGF, HIF-1a, and PGC-1a levels in ischemic skeletal muscles of CBS(+/-) mice. Concomitant with the reduced ischemic angiogenic responses, we also observed diminished leptin expression and attenuated Akt signaling in ischemic muscle fibers of CBS(+/-) mice. Moreover, there was enhanced atrogene, ubiquitin ligases that conjugate proteins for degradation during muscle atrophy, transcription, and reduced muscle function after ischemia in CBS(+/-) mice. These results suggest that HHcy adversely affects muscle-specific ischemic responses and contributes to muscle frailty.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) in the corpus cavernosum of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.METHODS: This study included 10 male SHRs and 10 healthy male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls, all aged 12 weeks. We applied a series of electric stimuli to the major pelvic ganglions of the rats, observed changes in the ratio of intracavernosal to mean arterial blood pressure (ICP/MAP), measured the levels of serum testosterone (T) and endogenous H2S, and determined the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: No obvious difference was found in the serum T level between the two groups. Compared with the WKY rats, the SHRs showed significant reduction in the ICP/MAP ratio, the contents of plasma H2S ([21.92 +/- 2.75] micromol/L vs [10.49 +/- 1.35] micromol/L, P &lt; 0.05) and endogenous corpus cavernosal H2S ([87.67 +/- 2.12] nmol/mg prot vs [52.60 +/- 3.44] nmol/mg prot, P &lt; 0.05), the level of endogenous H2S synthesis ([4.35 +/- 0.32] nmol/mg per min vs [1.14 +/- 0.07] nmol/mg per min, P &lt; 0.05) and the expressions of CBS and CSE (P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that CSE and CBS were distributed mainly in the smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells of the corpus cavernosum. The ICP/MAP ratio was highly positively correlated with the expressions of CSE (r = 0.977, P &lt; 0.05) and CBS (r = 0.955, P &lt; 0.05) in the corpus cavernosal tissue.CONCLUSION: Hypertension inhibits endogenous H2S synthesis by suppressing the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum, which might be related with hypertension-induced reduction of erectile function.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and is enzymatically metabolized in mitochondria by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR). Recent studies have indicated that H2S is synthesized by CSE in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), and is responsible for the anticontractile effect of PVAT on adjacent vessels. The lipophilic statin atorvastatin increases PVAT-derived H2S by suppressing its mitochondrial oxidation; the effect that results from statin-induced depletion of ubiquinone. Experimental obesity induced by a highly palatable diet has a time-dependent effect on H2S in PVAT. Adipose tissue hypoxia suppresses H2S oxidation and increases its level in short-term obesity not associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, in long-term obesity, insulin resistance and (or) hyperinsulinemia result in the down-regulation of CSE and H2S deficiency, which is corrected by treatment with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist administered for 2 weeks increases H2S by impairing mitochondria biogenesis. This indicates that the rate of mitochondrial H2S oxidation plays an important role in the regulation of H2S level in PVAT. Up-regulation of H2S signaling in short-term obesity and (or) by elevated endocannabinoids may be a compensatory mechanism that maintains vascular tone, despite endothelial dysfunction.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies and correlate with severity of heart failure in cross-sectional surveys. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a selective homocysteine lowering intervention beneficially affects cardiac remodelling and cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) in a murine model of combined hypercholesterolemia and hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer strategy was evaluated in female C57BL/6 low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)<U+207B>/<U+207B> cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs)<U+207A>/<U+207B> deficient mice fed a hyperhomocysteinemic and high saturated fat/high cholesterol diet using an E1E3E4-deleted hepatocyte-specific adenoviral vector expressing Cbs (AdCBS). MI was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery 14 days after saline injection or gene transfer. AdCBS gene transfer resulted in a persistent more than 5-fold (p&lt;0.01) decrease of plasma homocysteine levels and significantly improved endothelial progenitor cell function. Selective homocysteine lowering enhanced infarct healing as indicated by a 21% (p&lt;0.01) reduction of infarct length at day 28 after MI and by an increased number of capillaries and increased collagen content in the infarct zone. Adverse remodelling was attenuated in AdCBS MI mice as evidenced by a 29% (p&lt;0.05) reduction of left ventricular cavity area at day 28, by an increased capillary density in the remote myocardium, and by reduced interstitial collagen. The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 19% (p&lt;0.05) and the time constant of left ventricular relaxation was reduced by 21% (p&lt;0.05) in AdCBS MI mice compared to control MI mice, indicating improved diastolic function.SIGNIFICANCE: Selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer improves infarct healing, attenuates remodelling, and significantly enhances diastolic function post-MI in female C57BL/6 Ldlr<U+207B>/<U+207B> Cbs<U+207A>/<U+207B> mice. The current study corroborates the view that hyperhomocysteinemia exerts direct effects on the myocardium and may potentiate the development of heart failure.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, characterized by high plasma homocysteine levels, is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The increased synthesis of homocysteine, a product of methionine metabolism involving B vitamins, and its slower intracellular utilization cause increased flux into the blood. Plasma homocysteine level is an important reflection of hepatic methionine metabolism and the rate of processes modified by B vitamins as well as different enzyme activity. Lowering homocysteine might offer therapeutic benefits. However, approximately 50% of hyperhomocysteinemic patients due to cystathionine-beta-synthase deficiency are biochemically responsive to pharmacological doses of B vitamins. Therefore, effective treatments to reduce homocysteine levels are needed, and gene therapy could provide a novel approach. We recently showed that hepatic expression of DYRK1A, a serine/threonine kinase, is negatively correlated with plasma homocysteine levels in cystathionine-beta-synthase deficient mice, a mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Therefore, Dyrk1a is a good candidate for gene therapy to normalize homocysteine levels. We then used an adenoviral construct designed to restrict expression of DYRK1A to hepatocytes, and found decreased plasma homocysteine levels after hepatocyte-specific Dyrk1a gene transfer in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. The elevation of pyridoxal phosphate was consistent with the increase in cystathionine-beta-synthase activity. Commensurate with the decreased plasma homocysteine levels, targeted hepatic expression of DYRK1A resulted in elevated plasma paraoxonase-1 activity and apolipoprotein A-I levels, and rescued the Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways in aorta of mice, which can prevent homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction. These results demonstrate that hepatocyte-restricted Dyrk1a gene transfer can offer a useful therapeutic targets for the development of new selective homocysteine lowering therapy.

PURPOSE: Mice with moderate/severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency or absence of the cbs gene encoding cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) have marked retinal disruption, ganglion cell loss, optic nerve mitochondrial dysfunction, and ERG defects; those with mild hyperhomocysteinemia have delayed retinal morphological/functional phenotype. Excess homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases; however, it is not known whether excess homocysteine alters retinal vasculature.METHODS: Cbs(+/+), cbs(+/-), and cbs(-/-) mice (age ~3 weeks) were subjected to angiography; retinas were harvested for cryosections, flat-mount preparations, or trypsin digestion and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize vessels using isolectin-B4, to detect angiogenesis using anti-VEGF and anti-endoglin (anti-CD105) and activated glial cells (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein [anti-GFAP]) and to investigate the blood-retinal barrier using the tight junction markers zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Expression of vegf was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were treated with excess homocysteine to analyze permeability.RESULTS: Angiography revealed vascular leakage in cbs(-/-) mice; immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated vascular patterns consistent with ischemia; isolectin-B4 labeling revealed a capillary-free zone centrally and new vessels with capillary tufts midperipherally. This was associated with increased vegf mRNA and protein, CD105, and GFAP in cbs(-/-) retinas concomitant with a marked decrease in ZO-1 and occludin. Homocysteine-treated HRECs showed increased permeability.CONCLUSIONS: Severe elevation of homocysteine in cbs(-/-) mutant mice is accompanied by alterations in retinal vasculature (ischemia, neovascularization, and incompetent blood-retinal barrier). The marked disruption of retinal structure and decreased visual function reported in cbs(-/-) mice may reflect vasculopathy as well as neuropathy.

Availability of methionine is known to modulate the rate of aging in model organisms, best illustrated by the observation that dietary methionine restriction extends the lifespan of rodents. However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In eukaryotic cells, methionine can be converted to cysteine through the reverse transsulfuration pathway thereby modulating intracellular methionine availability. Whereas previous results obtained in yeast and fruit flies suggest that alterations in the reverse transsulfuration pathway modulate the rate of aging, it is not known whether this function is conserved in evolution. Here we show that depletion of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), a rate limiting enzyme in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, induces premature senescence in human endothelial cells. We found that CBS depletion induces mild mitochondrial dysfunction and increases the sensitivity of endothelial cells to homocysteine, a known inducer of endothelial cell senescence and an established risk factor for vascular disease. Our finding that CBS deficiency induces endothelial cell senescencein vitro, involving both mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility of the cells to homocysteine, suggests a new mechanism linking CBS deficiency to vascular aging and disease.

Hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S) is emerging as an important endogenous modulator, which exhibits the beneficial effects of nitric oxide (NO) on the cardiovascular (CV) system, without producing toxic metabolites. H(2)S is biosynthesized in mammalian tissues by cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase. H(2)S exhibits the antioxidant properties of inorganic and organic sulphites, behaving as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. There is also clear evidence that H(2)S triggers other important effects, mainly mediated by the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)). This mechanism accounts for the vasorelaxing and cardioprotective effects of H(2)S. Furthermore, H(2)S inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and platelet aggregation. In non-CV systems, H(2)S regulates the functions of the central nervous system, as well as respiratory, gastroenteric, and endocrine systems. Conversely, H(2)S deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Likewise, impairment of H(2)S biosynthesis is involved in CV complications associated with diabetes mellitus. There is also evidence of a cross-talk between the H(2)S and the endothelial NO pathways. In particular, recent observations indicate a possible pathogenic link between deficiencies of H(2 S activity and the progress of endothelial dysfunction. These biological aspects of endogenous H(2)S have led several authors to look at this mediator as &quot;the new NO&quot; that has given attractive opportunities to develop innovative classes of drugs. In this review, the main biological actions of H(2)S are discussed. Moreover, some examples of H(2)S-donors are shown, as well as some hybrids, in which H(2)S-releasing moieties are added to well-known drugs, for improving their pharmacodynamic profile or reducing the potential for adverse effects, are reported.

PURPOSE: Hyperhomocysteinemia is well recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of premature atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, however, may be prevented by polyphenols, potent antioxidant compounds with anti-atherogenic properties. Previously, we used cystathionine beta synthase-deficient mice [Cbs (±)] fed a high-methionine diet-a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia-to show that daily intake of a red wine polyphenolic extract, mainly comprised of catechin and epicatechin, has a beneficial effect on aortic expression of endothelial dysfunction biomarkers and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of the present study was to understand whether catechin and epicatechin, in purified forms, have anti-atherogenic effects in hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODS: Cbs (±) mice received 50 µg of catechin and/or epicatechin daily in drinking water for 1 month. Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and aortic expression of several endothelial dysfunction biomarkers (Vcam-1, Icam-1, E-selectin, and Lox-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf-a, Il-6) were assessed.RESULTS: We found that both catechin and epicatechin had a beneficial effect on plasma homocysteine levels and endothelial dysfunction biomarker expression; however, only catechin had a beneficial effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Further, when both polyphenols were given, a beneficial effect was observed only on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.CONCLUSIONS: Catechin seems to be a more potent anti-atherogenic compound than epicatechin in hyperhomocysteinemia and should be considered as a novel therapeutic approach against endothelial dysfunction induced by this condition.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been found to play beneficial roles in ameliorating several diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiac/renal ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), the main enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway, catalyze H(2)S production in mammalian tissues. However, the distributions and precise roles of these enzymes in the kidney have not yet been identified.METHODS: The present study examined the localization of both enzymes in the normal kidney and the effect of the H(2)S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) in the renal peritubular capillary (PTC) under conditions of diabetic nephropathy, using pancreatic ß-cell-specific calmodulin-overexpressing transgenic mice as a model of diabetes.RESULTS: In the normal kidney, we detected expression of both CBS and CSE in the brush border and cytoplasm of the proximal tubules, but not in the glomeruli, distal tubules and vascular endothelial cells of renal PTCs. Administration of NaHS increased PTC diameter and blood flow. We further evaluated whether biosynthesis of H(2)S was altered in a spontaneous diabetic model that developed renal lesions similar to human diabetic nephropathy. CSE expression was markedly reduced under diabetic conditions, whereas CBS expression was unaffected. Progressive diabetic nephropathy showed vasoconstriction and a loss of blood flow in PTCs that was ameliorated by NaHS treatment.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CSE expression in the proximal tubules may also regulate tubulointerstitial microcirculation via H(2)S production. H(2)S may represent a target of treatment to prevent progression of ischemic injury in diabetic nephropathy.

Hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S) is now viewed as an important endogenous gasotransmitter, which exhibits many beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. H(2)S is biosynthesized in mammalian tissues by both non-enzymatic processes and several enzymatic pathways ensured by cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase. H(2)S is endowed with the antioxidant properties of inorganic and organic sulphites, being a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, H(2)S triggers other important effects and the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) accounts for its vasorelaxing and cardioprotective effects. H(2)S also inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and platelet aggregation. Conversely, the impairment of H(2)S contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension and is involved in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus. There is also evidence of a link between H(2)S and endothelial nitric oxide (NO). Recent observations indicate a possible pathogenic link between deficiencies of H(2)S activity and the progress of endothelial dysfunction. These biological aspects of endogenous H(2)S led to consider this mediator as &quot;the new NO&quot; and to evaluate new attractive opportunities to develop innovative classes of drugs. In this review, the main roles played by H(2)S in the cardiovascular system and the first examples of H(2)S-donor drugs are discussed. Some hybrid drugs are also addressed in this review. In such compounds opportune H(2)S-releasing moieties are conjugated to well-known drugs to improve their pharmacodynamic profile or to reduce the potential for adverse effects.



#### Increased endogenous H2S generation by CBS, CSE, and 3MST gene therapy improves ex vivo renovascular relaxation in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been identified as a regulator of various physiological events, including vasodilation, angiogenesis, antiapoptotic, and cellular signaling. Endogenously, H(2)S is produced as a metabolite of homocysteine (Hcy) by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). Although Hcy is recognized as vascular risk factor at an elevated level [hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)] and contributes to vascular injury leading to renovascular dysfunction, the exact mechanism is unclear. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether conversion of Hcy to H(2)S improves renovascular function. Ex vivo renal artery culture with CBS, CSE, and 3MST triple gene therapy generated more H(2)S in the presence of Hcy, and these arteries were more responsive to endothelial-dependent vasodilation compared with nontransfected arteries treated with high Hcy. Cross section of triple gene-delivered renal arteries immunostaining suggested increased expression of CD31 and VEGF and diminished expression of the antiangiogenic factor endostatin. In vitro endothelial cell culture demonstrated increased mitophagy during high levels of Hcy and was mitigated by triple gene delivery. Also, dephosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated FoxO3 in HHcy were reversed by H(2)S or triple gene delivery. Upregulated matrix metalloproteinases-13 and downregulated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in HHcy were normalized by overexpression of triple genes. Together, these results suggest that H(2)S plays a key role in renovasculopathy during HHcy and is mediated through Akt/FoxO3 pathways. We conclude that conversion of Hcy to H(2)S by CBS, CSE, or 3MST triple gene therapy improves renovascular function in HHcy.

In hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction due to reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide is a consistent finding. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Increased levels of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) have been associated with HHcy, and may contribute, at least in part, for the homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction, but whether cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is associated with increased ADMA has hardly been investigated. To address this question, we measured total homocysteine (tHcy), ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in plasma of 22 adult CBS deficient patients, using established HPLC techniques. Results showed that in CBS deficient patients with elevated levels of tHcy (median (total range): 33 (14-237) µmol/L), both ADMA and SDMA levels were normal. Moreover, tHcy and ADMA concentrations were not correlated (r(s)=0.017, p=0.94). Our results favor the hypothesis that the negative vascular effects of HHcy have an ADMA-independent etiology.

Though the existence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in biological tissues has been known for over 300 years, it is the most recently appreciated of the gasotransmitters as a physiologic messenger molecule. The enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) had long been speculated to generate H2S, and inhibitors of these enzymes had been employed to characterize influences of H2S in various organs. Definitive evidence that H2S is a physiologic regulator came with the development of mice with targeted deletion of CSE and CBS. Best characterized is the role of H2S, formed by CSE, as an endothelial derived relaxing factor that normally regulates blood pressure by acting through ATP-sensitive potassium channels. H2S participates in various phases of the inflammatory process, predominantly exerting anti-inflammatory actions. Currently, the most advanced efforts to develop therapeutic agents involve the combination of H2S donors with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The H2S releasing moiety provides cytoprotection to gastric mucosa normally adversely affected by NSAIDs while the combination of H2S and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may afford synergistic anti-inflammatory influences.

Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While Hcy has been shown to promote endothelial dysfunction by decreasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide and increasing oxidative stress in the vasculature, the effects of Hcy on cardiomyocytes remain less understood. In this study we explored the effects of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) on myocardial function ex vivo and examined the direct effects of Hcy on cardiomyocyte function and survival in vitro. Studies with isolated hearts from wild type and HHcy mice (heterozygous cystathionine-beta synthase deficient mice) demonstrated that HHcy mouse hearts had more severely impaired cardiac relaxation and contractile function and increased cell death following ischemia reperfusion (I/R). In isolated cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes, exposure to Hcy for 24 h impaired cardiomyocyte contractility in a concentration-dependent manner, and promoted apoptosis as revealed by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling and cleaved caspase-3 immunoblotting. These effects were associated with activation of p38 MAPK, decreased expression of thioredoxin (TRX) protein, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of p38 MAPK by the selective inhibitor SB203580 (5 µM) prevented all of these Hcy-induced changes. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TRX in cardiomyocytes significantly attenuated Hcy-induced ROS generation, apoptosis, and impairment of myocyte contractility. Thus, Hcy may increase the risk for CVD not only by causing endothelial dysfunction, but also by directly exerting detrimental effects on cardiomyocytes.

More than 29 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with hearing loss. Interestingly, elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), are also associated with impaired hearing. However, the associated mechanism remains obscure. The collagen receptor such as discoidin domain receptor 1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) play a significant role in inner ear structure and function. We hypothesize that HHcy increases hearing thresholds by compromise in inner ear vasculature resulted from impaired Hcy metabolism, increased oxidative stress, collagen IVa and collagen Ia turnover. The treatment with folic acid (FA) protects elevated hearing thresholds and prevents reduction in vessel density by lowering abundant collagen deposition and oxidative stress in inner ear. To test this hypothesis we employed 8 weeks old male wild type (WT), cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice, WT + FA (0.0057 µg/g/day, equivalent to a 400 µg/70 kg/day human dose in drinking water); and CBS(+/-) +FA. The mice were treated for four weeks. The hearing thresholds were determined by recording the auditory brainstem responses. Integrity of vessels was analyzed by perfusion of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracer. Endothelial permeability was assessed, which indicated restoration of HRP leakage by FA treatment. A total Hcy level was increased in stria vascularis (SV) and spiral ligament (SL) of CBS+/- mice which was lowered by FA. Interestingly, FA treatment lowered Col IVa Immunostaining by affecting its turnover. The levels of MMP-2, -9, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathione gamma lyase (CSE) were measured by Western blot analysis. The oxidative stress was high in SV and SL of CBS+/- compared to WT however the treatment with FA lowered oxidative stress in CBS+/- mice. These data suggested that hearing loss in CBS+/- mice was primarily due to leakage in inner ear circulation, also partly by induced collagen imbalance, increase in Hcy and oxidative stress in inner ear.

Hyperhomocysteinemia confers a high risk for thrombotic vascular events, but homocysteine-lowering therapies have been ineffective in reducing the incidence of secondary vascular outcomes, raising questions regarding the role of homocysteine as a mediator of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, to determine the contribution of elevated homocysteine to thrombosis susceptibility, we studied Cbs(-/-) mice conditionally expressing a zinc-inducible mutated human CBS (I278T) transgene. Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice exhibited severe hyperhomocysteinemia and endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arterioles. Surprisingly, however, these mice did not display increased susceptibility to arterial or venous thrombosis as measured by photochemical injury in the carotid artery, chemical injury in the carotid artery or mesenteric arterioles, or ligation of the inferior vena cava. A survey of hemostatic and hemodynamic parameters revealed no detectible differences between control and Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice. Our data demonstrate that severe elevation in homocysteine leads to the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction but is not sufficient to promote thrombosis. These findings may provide insights into the failure of homocysteine-lowering trials in secondary prevention from thrombotic vascular events.

Hyperhomocysteinemia was first associated with degenerative disease by observation of accelerated arteriosclerosis in children with inherited disorders of cystathionine synthase, methionine synthase, and methylene tetrohydrofolate reductase. The metabolic blockade of sulfate synthesis from homocysteine thiolactone in malignant cells is ascribed to a deficiency of a chemopreventive derivative of homocysteine thiolactone that occurs in normal cells. Its chemical structure was elucidated by the organic synthesis of thioretinamide from retinoic acid and homocysteine thiolactone. Oxidation of the sulfur atom of homocysteine is inhibited in scorbutic guinea pigs, demonstrating ascorbate function in sulfate synthesis from homocysteine. Studies of homocysteine metabolism in protein energy malnutrition led to the conclusion that the biosynthesis of thioretinamide from the retinol of transthyretin is catalyzed by dehydroascorbate and superoxide generated from the heme oxygenase group of cystathionine synthase. Newly synthesized thioretinamide is complexed with cobalamin to form thioretinaco, which is activated by ozone and oxygen to function as the active site of oxidative phosphorylation. In accordance with the trophoblastic theory of cancer, pancreatic enzymes are believed to be oncolytic because they hydrolyze the homocysteinylated proteins, nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans of malignant tissues. The clonal selection of malignant cells that are deficient in the heme oxygenase function of cystathionine synthase produces cells dependent upon glycolysis for ATP synthesis, since they are deficient in synthesis of thioretinamide, thioretinaco and thioretinaco ozonide. The vulnerable plaque of arteriosclerosis originates from complexes of microbes with homocysteinylated lipoproteins, obstructing vasa vasorum narrowed by endothelial dysfunction, causing arterial ischemia, and intimal micro-abscesses. Degenerative diseases may be ameliorated by a proposed therapeutic protocol of thioretinamide with pancreatic enzymes.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) was the third gaseous transmitter to be discovered, along with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and has been proposed to be involved in numerous physiological processes and pathology of various diseases. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is characterized by multiple key events including endothelial dysfunction, monocyte infiltration and their differentiation into macrophages, conversion of lesion-resident macrophages into foam cells, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has indicated that H(2)S plays a potentially significant role in all of these biological processes and that malfunction of H(2)S homeostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Experiments have demonstrated that H(2)S supplementation ameliorated many of these atherogenic processes and hence, such supplementation potentially may prove to be of therapeutic benefit in the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis. H(2)S levels may be induced by the administration of H(2)S or H(2)S donors, or alternatively be reduced by the administration of specific cystathionine ß-synthase or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase inhibitors. However, issues remain with the potential use of currently available H(2)S-modulating agents in a clinical setting. This review will provide a description of the current literature on the involvement of H(2)S in these key aspects of vascular biology that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, as well as the therapeutic potential of currently available H(2)S-modulating agents.

Human atherosclerotic coronary vessels elicited vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (Ach) and revealed a phenomenon of vasospasm. Homocysteine (Hcy) levels are elevated in the atherosclerotic plaque tissue, suggesting its pathological role in endothelial damage in atherosclerotic diseases. Accordingly, we examined the role hyperhomocysteinemia in coronary endothelial dysfunction, vessel wall thickness, lumen narrowing, leading to acute/chronic coronary vasospasm. The therapeutic potential and mechanisms of folic acid (FA) using hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine beta synthase heterozygote (CBS-/+) and wild type (CBS+/+) mice were addressed. The CBS-/+ and CBS+/+ mice were treated with or without a Hcy lowering agent FA in drinking water (0.03 g/L) for 4 weeks. The isolated mouse septum coronary artery was cannulated and pressurized at 60 mmHg. The wall thickness and lumen diameters were measured by Ion-Optic. The vessels were treated with Ach (10(-8) -10(-5) <U+2009>M) and, for comparison, with non-endothelial vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (10(-5) <U+2009>M). The endothelium-impaired arteries from CBC-/+ mice constricted in response to Ach and this vasoconstriction was mitigated with FA supplementation. The level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was lower in coronary artery in CBS-/+ than of CBS+/+ mice. Treatment with FA increased the levels of Ach-induced NO generation in the coronary artery of CBS-/+ mice. The results suggest that Ach induced coronary vasoconstriction in CBS-/+ mice and this vasoconstriction was ameliorated by FA treatment. The mechanisms for the impairment of vascular function and therapeutic effects of FA may be related to the regulation of eNOS expression, NO availability and tissue homocysteine.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for ischemic cardiovascular diseases, but its causal role in atherothrombosis remains controversial. Proatherogenic and/or prothrombotic effects may underlie the potential causal relation between hyperhomocysteinemia and cardiovascular events. Here, the effects of selective lowering of plasma homocysteine, plasma cholesterol, or both on endothelial function and on atherogenesis in male hyperlipidemic and hyperhomocysteinemic C57BL/6 low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr)(-/-)/cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS)(+/-)-deficient mice were investigated. Second, we evaluated whether selective homocysteine lowering has anti-thrombotic effects in a model of arterial thrombosis. A hyperhomocysteinemic and atherogenic diet was started at the age of 12 weeks. Three weeks later, gene transfer was performed with E1E3E4-deleted adenoviral vectors for hepatocyte-restricted overexpression of CBS (AdCBS) or of the LDLr (AdLDLr), or with the control vector Adnull. In a fourth group, AdCBS and AdLDLr were co-administered. Selective homocysteine lowering but not selective cholesterol lowering restored endothelial function at 6 weeks after gene transfer. Intimal area in the aortic root and in the brachiocephalic artery at 13 weeks was more than 100-fold (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) smaller in AdLDLr and AdCBS/AdLDLr mice than in control mice and AdCBS mice. No differences in intimal area were observed between control mice and AdCBS mice. In a model of carotid artery thrombosis, the average time to first occlusion and to stable occlusion were 1.9-fold (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and 2.1-fold longer (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), respectively, in AdCBS-treated mice than in control mice. Taken together, these data show that correction of endothelial dysfunction following selective homocysteine lowering has anti-thrombotic but no anti-atherogenic effects.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with endothelial dysfunction (ED), but the mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of HHcy-induced ED in microvasculature in our newly established mouse model of severe HHcy (plasma total homocysteine, 169.5 µM). We found that severe HHcy impaired nitric oxide (NO)- and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated, endothelium-dependent relaxations of small mesenteric arteries (SMAs). Endothelium-independent and prostacyclin-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations were not changed. A nonselective Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel (K(Ca)) inhibitor completely blocked EDHF-mediated relaxation. Selective blockers for small-conductance K(Ca) (SK) or intermediate-conductance K(Ca) (IK) failed to inhibit EDHF-mediated relaxation in HHcy mice. HHcy increased the levels of SK3 and IK1 protein, superoxide (O(2)(-)), and 3-nitrotyrosine in the endothelium of SMAs. Preincubation with antioxidants and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) inhibitors improved endothelium-dependent and EDHF-mediated relaxations and decreased O(2)(-) production in SMAs from HHcy mice. Further, EDHF-mediated relaxation was inhibited by ONOO(-) and prevented by catalase in the control mice. Finally, L-homocysteine stimulated O(2)(-) production, which was reversed by antioxidants, and increased SK/IK protein levels and tyrosine nitration in cultured human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that HHcy impairs EDHF relaxation in SMAs by inhibiting SK/IK activities via oxidation- and tyrosine nitration-related mechanisms.

In hypertension, an increase in arterial wall thickness and loss of elasticity over time result in an increase in pulse wave velocity, a direct measure of arterial stiffness. This change is reflected in gradual fragmentation and loss of elastin fibers and accumulation of stiffer collagen fibers in the media that occurs independently of atherosclerosis. Similar results are seen with an elevated level of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), which increases vascular thickness, elastin fragmentation, and arterial blood pressure. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated a decrease in elasticity and an increase in pulse wave velocity in HHcy cystathionine ß synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS(-/+)) mice. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in MMP-NO-TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) inhibitory tertiary complex. We have demonstrated the contribution of the NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, in the activation of latent MMP. The differential production of NO contributes to oxidative stress and increased oxidative/nitrative activation of MMP resulting in vascular remodeling in response to HHcy. The contribution of the NOS isoforms, endothelial and inducible in the collagen/elastin switch, has been demonstrated. We have showed that an increase in inducible NOS activity is a key contributor to HHcy-mediated collagen/elastin switch and resulting decline in aortic compliance. In addition, increased levels of Hcy compete and suppress the <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid-receptor, N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. The HHcy causes oxidative stress by generating nitrotyrosine, activating the latent MMPs and decreasing the endothelial NO concentration. The HHcy causes elastinolysis and decrease elastic complicance of the vessel wall. The treatment with <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid-receptor agonist (muscimol), N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist (MK-801), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (ciprofibrate and ciglitazone) mitigates the cardiovascular dysfunction in HHcy [corrected].

Remodeling by its very nature implies synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components (such as elastin, collagen, and connexins). Most of the vascular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are latent because of the presence of constitutive nitric oxide (NO). However, during oxidative stress peroxinitrite (ONOO-) activates the latent MMPs and instigates vascular remodeling. Interestingly, in mesenteric artery, homocysteine (Hcy) decreases the NO bio-availability, and folic acid (FA, an Hcy-lowering agent) mitigates the Hcy-mediated mesentery artery dysfunction. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 (DDAH-2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) increases NO production. The hypothesis was that the Hcy decreased NO bio-availability, in part, activating MMP, decreasing elastin, DDAH-2, eNOS and increased vasomotor response by increasing connexin. To test this hypothesis,the authors used 12-week-old C57BJ/L6 wild type (WT) and hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy)-cystathione beta synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice. Blood pressure measurements were made by radio-telemetry. WT and MMP-9 knockout mice were administered with Hcy (0.67 mg/ml in drinking water). Superior mesenteric artery and mesenteric arcade were analyzed with light and confocal microscopy. The protein expressions were measured by western blot analysis. The mRNA levels for MMP-9 were measured by RT-PCR. The data showed decreased DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions in mesentery in CBS-/+ mice compared with WT mice. Immuno-fluorescence and western blot results suggest increased MMP-9 and connexin-40 expression in mesenteric arcades of CBS-/+ mice compared with WT mice. The wall thickness of third-order mesenteric artery was increased in CBS-/+ mice compared to WT mice. Hcy treatment increased blood pressure in WT mice. Interestingly, in MMP-9 KO, Hcy did not increase blood pressure. These results may suggest that HHcy causes mesenteric artery remodeling and narrowing by activating MMP-9 and decreasing DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions, compromising the blood flow, instigating hypertension, and acute abdomen pain.

BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and hyperglycemia cause diabetic cardiomyopathy by inducing oxidative stress and attenuating peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. However, their synergistic contribution is not clear.METHODS: Diabetic Akita (Ins2+/-) and hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine beta synthase mutant (CBS+/-) were used for M-mode echocardiography at the age of four and twenty four weeks. The cardiac rings from WT, Akita and hybrid (Ins2+/-/CBS+/-) of Akita and CBS+/- were treated with different doses of acetylcholine (an endothelial dependent vasodilator). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed for determining plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level in the above groups. Akita was treated with ciglitazone (CZ) - a PPAR gamma agonist and tempol-an anti-oxidant, separately and their effects on cardiac remodeling were assessed.RESULTS: At twenty four week, Akita mice were hyperglycemic and HHcy. They have increased end diastolic diameter (EDD). In their heart PPAR gamma, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 (TIMP-4) and anti-oxidant thioredoxin were attenuated whereas matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, TIMP-3 and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) were induced. Interestingly, they showed synergism between HHcy and hyperglycemia for endothelial-myocyte (E-M) uncoupling. Additionally, treatment with CZ alleviated MMP-9 activity and fibrosis, and improved EDD. On the other hand, treatment with tempol reversed cardiac remodeling in part by restoring the expressions of TIMP-3,-4, thioredoxin and MMP-9.CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous homocysteine exacerbates diabetic cardiomyopathy by attenuating PPAR gamma and inducing E-M uncoupling leading to diastolic dysfunction. PPAR gamma agonist and tempol mitigates oxidative stress and ameliorates diastolic dysfunction in diabetes.

A decrease in vascular elasticity and an increase in pulse wave velocity in hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy) cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS(-/+)) mice has been observed. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in MMP-NO-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) inhibitory tertiary complex. However, the contribution of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms eNOS and iNOS in the activation of latent MMP is unclear. We hypothesize that the differential production of NO contributes to oxidative stress and increased oxidative/nitrative activation of MMP, resulting in vascular remodeling in response to HHcy. The overall goal is to elucidate the contribution of the NOS isoforms, endothelial and inducible, in the collagen/elastin switch. Experiments were performed on six groups of animals [wild-type (WT), eNOS(-/-), and iNOS(-/-) with and without homocysteine (Hcy) treatment (0.67 g/l) for 8-12 wk]. In vivo echograph was performed to assess aortic timed flow velocity for indirect compliance measurement. Histological determination of collagen and elastin with trichrome and van Gieson stains, respectively, was performed. In situ measurement of superoxide generation using dihydroethidium was used. Differential expression of eNOS, iNOS, nitrotyrosine, MMP-2 and -9, and elastin were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses. The 2% gelatin zymography was used to assess MMP activity. The increase in O(2)(-) and robust activity of MMP-9 in eNOS(-/-), WT+Hcy, and eNOS(-/-)+Hcy was accompanied by the gross disorganization and thickening of the ECM along with extensive collagen deposition and elastin degradation (collagen/elastin switch) resulting in a decrease in aortic timed flow velocity. Results show that an increase in iNOS activity is a key contributor to HHcy-mediated collagen/elastin switch and resulting decline in aortic compliance.

Increased levels of homocysteine (Hcy), recognized as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), were associated with cardiovascular diseases. There was controversy regarding the detrimental versus cardio protective role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in ischemic heart disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the Hcy generated nitrotyrosine by inducing the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, causing endothelial-myocyte (E-M) coupling. To differentiate the role of iNOS versus constitutive nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) in Hcy-mediated nitrotyrosine generation and matrix remodeling in cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular (LV) tissue was analyzed from cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) heterozygote knockout, iNOS homozygote knockout, CBS-/+/iNOS-/- double knockout, and wild-type (WT) mice. The levels of nitrotyrosine, MMP-2 and -9 (zymographic analysis), and fibrosis (by trichrome stain) were measured. The endothelial-myocyte function was determined in cardiac rings. In CBS-/+ mice, homocysteine was elevated and in iNOS-/- mice, nitric oxide was significantly reduced. The nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels were elevated in double knockout and CBS-/+ as compared to WT mice. Although MMP-2 levels were similar in CBS-/+, iNOS-/-, and CBS-/+/iNOS-/-, the levels were three- to fourfold higher than WT. The levels of collagen were similar in CBS-/+ and iNOS-/-, but they were threefold higher than WT. Interesting, the levels of collagen increased sixfold in double knockouts, compared to WT, suggesting synergism between high Hcy and lack of iNOS. Left ventricular hypertrophy was exaggerated in the iNOS-/- and double knockout, and mildly increased in the CBS-/+, compared to WT mice. The endothelial-dependent relaxation was attenuated to the same extent in the CBS-/+ and iNOS-/-, compared to WT, but it was robustly blunted in double knockouts. The results concluded that homocysteine generated nitrotyrosine in the vicinity of endothelium, caused MMP activation and endothelium-myocyte uncoupling. The generation of nitrotyrosine was independent of iNOS.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, or abnormally high plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration, has often been associated with vascular thrombosis and the development of premature atherosclerosis. Many studies have shown that moderate wine consumption has potential beneficial effects related to the prevention of atherosclerosis, in part attributed to the biological properties of polyphenolic components, mainly flavonoids. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of a red wine polyphenolic extract (PE) administration on hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency and on the associated biochemical markers of hepatic and endothelial dysfunctions in mice. Red wine PE was added for 4 weeks to the drinking water of heterozygous CBS-deficient mice fed a high-methionine diet, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Red wine PE supplementation at low dose significantly reduced plasma Hcy levels and restored the hepatic and plasma-decreased paraoxonase-1 activity induced by chronic hyperhomocysteinemia. Moreover, aortic expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules and levels of soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 were reduced in hyperhomocysteinemic mice fed the red wine PE supplementation. These findings suggest that red wine PE administration in low quantities has beneficial effects on biochemical markers of endothelial dysfunction due to hyperhomocysteinemia.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, has been proposed to be a mediator of vascular dysfunction during hyperhomocysteinemia. Levels of ADMA are regulated by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, we tested the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia causes downregulation of the two genes encoding DDAH (Ddah1 and Ddah2). In the MS-1 murine endothelial cell line, the addition of homocysteine decreased NO production but did not elevate ADMA or alter levels of Ddah1 or Ddah2 mRNA. Mice heterozygous for cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs) and their wild-type littermates were fed either a control diet or a high-methionine/low-folate (HM/LF) diet to produce varying degrees of hyperhomocysteinemia. Maximal relaxation of the carotid artery to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine was decreased by approximately 50% in Cbs(+/-) mice fed the HM/LF diet compared with Cbs(+/+) mice fed the control diet (P &lt; 0.001). Compared with control mice, hyperhomocysteinemic mice had lower levels of Ddah1 mRNA in the liver (P &lt; 0.001) and lower levels of Ddah2 mRNA in the liver, lung, and kidney (P &lt; 0.05). Downregulation of DDAH expression in hyperhomocysteinemic mice did not result in an increase in plasma ADMA, possibly due to a large decrease in hepatic methylation capacity (S-adenosylmethionine-to-S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio). Our findings demonstrate that hyperhomocysteinemia causes tissue-specific decreases in DDAH expression without altering plasma ADMA levels in mice with endothelial dysfunction.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for arterial as well as venous thromboembolism. Individuals with severe hyperhomocysteinemia caused by inherited genetic defects in homocysteine metabolism have an extremely high incidence of vascular thrombosis unless they are treated aggressively with homocysteine-lowering therapy. The clinical value of homocysteine-lowering therapy in individuals with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, which is very common in populations at risk for vascular disease, is more controversial. Considerable progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular thrombotic events has been provided by the development of a variety of murine models. Because levels of homocysteine are regulated by both the methionine and folate cycles, hyperhomocysteinemia can be induced in mice through both genetic and dietary manipulations. Mice deficient in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene have been exploited widely in many studies investigating the vascular pathophysiology of hyperhomocysteinemia. In this article, we review the established murine models, including the CBS-deficient mouse as well as several newer murine models available for the study of hyperhomocysteinemia. We also summarize the major vascular phenotypes observed in these murine models.

Cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice (Cbs(-/-)) exhibit several pathophysiological features similar to hyperhomocysteinemic patients, including endothelial dysfunction and hepatic steatosis. Heterozygous mutants (Cbs(+/-)) on the C57BL/6J background are extensively analyzed in laboratories worldwide; however, detailed analyses of Cbs(-/-) have been hampered by the fact that they rarely survive past the weaning age probably due to severe hepatic dysfunction. We backcrossed the mutants with four inbred strains (C57BL/6J(Jcl), BALB/cA, C3H/HeJ and DBA/2J) for seven generations, and compared Cbs(-/-) phenotypes among the different genetic backgrounds. Although Cbs(-/-) on all backgrounds were hyperhomocysteinemic/hypermethioninemic and suffered from lipidosis/hepatic steatosis at 2 weeks of age, &gt;30% of C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-) survived over 8 weeks whereas none of DBA/2J-Cbs(-/-) survived beyond 5 weeks. At 2 weeks, serum levels of total homocysteine and triglyceride were lowest in C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-). Adult C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-) survivors showed hyperhomocysteinemia but escaped hypermethioninemia, lipidosis and hepatic steatosis. They appeared normal in general behavioral tests but showed cerebellar malformation and impaired learning ability in the passive avoidance step-through test, and required sufficient dietary supplementation of cyst(e)ine for survival, demonstrating the essential roles of cystathionine beta-synthase in the central nervous system function and cysteine biosynthesis. Our C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-) mice could be useful tools for investigating clinical symptoms such as mental retardation and thromboembolism that are found in homocysteinemic patients.

The exact mechanism(s) by which hyperhomocysteinaemia promotes vascular disease remains unclear. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the beneficial effect of folic acid on endothelial function is independent of homocysteine-lowering. In the present study the effect of a low (400 microg/70 kg/day) and high (5 mg/70 kg/day) dose folic acid supplement on endothelium-dependent relaxation in the isolated perfused mesenteric bed of heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficient mice was investigated. Elevated total plasma homocysteine and impaired relaxation responses to methacholine were observed in heterozygous mice. In the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester relaxation responses in wild-type tissues were reduced, but in heterozygous tissues were abolished. Clotrimazole and 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, both inhibitors of non-nitric oxide/non-prostanoid-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, reduced responses to methacholine in wild-type but not heterozygous tissues. The combination of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and either clotrimazole or 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibited relaxation responses in wild-type tissues. Both low and high dose folic acid increased plasma folate, reduced total plasma homocysteine and reversed endothelial dysfunction in heterozygous mice. A greater increase in plasma folate in the high dose group was accompanied by a more significant effect on endothelial function. In the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a significant residual relaxation response was evident in tissues from low and high dose folic acid treated heterozygous mice. These data suggest that the impaired mesenteric relaxation in heterozygous mice is largely due to loss of the non-nitric oxide/non-prostanoid component. While low dose folic acid may restore this response in a homocysteine-dependent manner, the higher dose has an additional effect on nitric oxide-mediated relaxation that would appear to be independent of homocysteine lowering.

Chronic hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an important factor in development of arterial hypertension. HHcy is associated with activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); however, it is unclear whether HHcy-dependent extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation plays a role in arterial hypertrophy and hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that in HHcy the mechanism of arterial hypertension involves arterial dysfunction in response to ECM accumulation between endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells and subsequent endothelium-myocyte (E-M) uncoupling. To decrease plasma Hcy, dietary supplementation with 3-deazaadenosine (DZA), the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, was administered to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) knockout (KO) mice. Mice were grouped as follows: wild type (WT; control), WT+DZA, CBSKO, and CBSKO+DZA (n = 4/group). Mean aortic blood pressure and heart rate were monitored in real time with a telemetric system before, during, and after DZA treatment (6 wk total). In vivo aorta function and morphology were analyzed by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography in anesthetized mice. Aorta MMP activity in unfixed cryostat sections was measured with DQ gelatin. Aorta MMP-2, MMP-9, and connexin 43 expression were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. HHcy caused increased aortic blood pressure and resistance, tachycardia, and increased wall thickness and ECM accumulation in aortic wall vs. control groups. There was a linear correlation between aortic wall thickness and plasma Hcy levels. MMP-2, MMP-9, and connexin 43 expression were increased in HHcy. In the CBSKO+DZA group, aortic blood pressure and levels of MMP and connexin 43 were close to those found in control groups. However, removal of DZA reversed the aortic lumen-to-wall thickness ratio in CBSKO mice, suggesting, in part, a role of vascular remodeling in the increase in blood pressure in HHcy. The results show that arterial hypertension in HHcy mice is, in part, associated with arterial remodeling and E-M uncoupling in response to MMP activation.

OBJECTIVE: Vascular disease is associated with increased plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and homocysteine, and both are increased in renal failure. In cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (CBS) there is severe hyperhomocysteinaemia, precocious vascular disease, and endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether ADMA levels are elevated in CBS patients with and without renal impairment, and whether lowering plasma homocysteine also lowers ADMA.METHODS: We measured plasma homocysteine, arginine, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines, nitrate + nitrite, creatinine and cystatin C in 23 CBS-deficient patients and 24 age-matched controls.RESULTS: In the patients, nitrate + nitrite and the ratio L: -arginine/ADMA were markedly reduced (21.6 +/- 6.1 vs 57.7 +/- 7.5 micromol/L and 132.9 +/- 24.7 vs 181.9 +/- 56.1, respectively, p &lt; 0.001 for both), reflecting endothelial dysfunction. Plasma ADMA for the group was moderately increased (0.55 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.07 micromol/L, p = 0.018), but this was due to significantly higher levels than controls in only those 7 of the 23 patients who had elevated cystatin C levels (0.59 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.07 mg/L, p = 0.007). Posttreatment total homocysteine in patients varied widely (15-285, median 92 micromol/L), but was not correlated with ADMA or other measured variables. In three newly-diagnosed patients, marked reduction of total homocysteine during treatment produced minimal changes in ADMA.CONCLUSIONS: ADMA levels were significantly increased only in the CBS-deficient patients with elevated cystatin C levels, and not in those with normal renal function. The reported relationship between hyperhomocysteinaemia and ADMA may not be direct, but could be secondary to reduced renal function.

OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with risk for cardiovascular disease. A common cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is folate deficiency. We sought to determine whether folate deficiency per se increases arterial permeability (quantitative fluorescence microscopy) and stiffness (vessel elastigraph), and whether the effects of folate deficiency are more severe in the presence of mild HHcy.METHODS AND RESULTS: Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)-deficient mice (CBS(+/-)) and their wild-type littermates (CBS(+/+)) were fed chow containing either standard (Con) or relatively low amounts of folate (LF) for 18+/-3 weeks. Liver folate (microg folate/g liver) and tHcy (microM), respectively, were 12+/-1 and 8+/-1 in CBS(+/+) Con mice (n=12), and 8+/-1 and 8+/-1 in CBS(+/+) LF animals (n=5). Carotid arterial permeability was &amp;38% greater (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/+) LF versus Con mice, but vascular stiffening was unaltered. Liver folate and tHcy, respectively, were 13+/-1 and 11+/-1 in CBS(+/-) Con mice (n=16), and 8+/-1 and 16+/-3 in CBS(+/-) LF animals (n=6). Carotid arterial dextran accumulation was &amp;31% greater, and maximal strain in aortae was &amp;20% lower (both P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) LF versus Con mice.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, low folate (P&lt;0.05) combined with mild HHcy (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) mice produced more arterial dysfunction compared with low folate alone (ie, CBS(+/+) mice). These findings may be particularly relevant to elderly individuals because tHcy and deficiencies of folate metabolism increase with age.

OBJECTIVE: A risk factor for cardiovascular disease, hyperhomocystinemia (HHcy), is associated with endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we examined the mechanistic role of HHcy in endothelial dysfunction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Through the use of 2 functional models, aortic rings and intravital video microscopy of the cremaster, we found that arterial relaxation in response to the endothelium-dependent vessel relaxant, acetylcholine or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activator (A23187), was significantly impaired in cystathionine beta-synthase null (CBS(-/-)) mice. However, the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) response to the nitric oxide (NO) donor (SNAP) was preserved in CBS(-/-) mice. In addition, superoxide dismutase and catalase failed to restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was significantly reduced in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) of CBS(-/-) mice, as well as in Hcy-treated mouse and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Hcy-mediated eNOS inhibition--which was not rescued by adenoviral transduction of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, or by tetrahydrobiopterin, sepiapterin, and arginine supplementations in MAEC--was associated with decreased protein expression and increased threonine 495 phosphorylation of eNOS in HAECs. Ultimately, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X (GFX), reversed Hcy-mediated eNOS inactivation and threonine 495 phosphorylation in HAECs.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HHcy impairs endothelial function and eNOS activity, primarily through PKC activation.

Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (HH) is an established independent risk factor for coronary, cerebral and peripheral vascular diseases. Recent studies have indicated that certain cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, impair expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endogenous angiogenesis. In this study, we investigate the impact of moderate HH on angiogenesis and VEGF pathway in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. Upon induction of unilateral hindlimb ischemia, endogenous angiogenesis, expression of VEGF, and phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1 were evaluated in mice heterozygous for a deletion of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (CBS) and compared with those observed in CBS+/+ mice. CBS+/- mice exhibit moderate HH, as demonstrated by measuring plasma total homocyst(e)ine (tHcy) levels, which were significantly higher in these animals compared with CBS+/+ mice (4.77 +/- 0.82 vs 2.10 +/- 0.28, p &lt; 0.01). Twenty-eight days after induction of ischemia, hindlimb blood flow was significantly reduced in CBS+/- mice compared with CBS+/+ animals (0.49 +/- 0.03, n = 12 vs 0.71 +/- 0.09, n = 10; p &lt; 0.05). In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between plasma homocyst(e)ine levels and the laser Doppler perfusion ratio in CBS+/- mice (p = 0.0087, r = -0.7171). While VEGF expression and Flk-1 phosphorylation were not impaired in the ischemic muscles of CBS+/- mice, phosphorylation of the endothelial cell survival factor Akt was significantly inhibited by homocyst(e)ine in a dose-dependent manner in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) in vitro. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that endogenous angiogenesis is inversely related to plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine in genetically engineered, heterozygous mice with moderate HH. This impairment, however, is not dependent on reduced expression of VEGF or impaired phosphorylation of its receptor Flk-1. In contrast, our data suggest that impaired Akt phosphorylation mediates the impairment of angiogenesis associated with HH.

Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with vascular dementias and Alzheimer's disease. The role of Hcy in brain microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) remodeling is unclear. Hcy competes with muscimol, an gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor agonist. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Our hypothesis is that Hcy induces constrictive microvascular remodeling by altering GABA-A/B receptors. MVEC from wild type, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) knockout (-/-), heterozygote cystathionine beta synthase (CBS-/+), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS-/-) mouse brains were isolated. The MVEC were incorporated into collagen (3.2 mg/ml) gels and the decrease in collagen gel diameter at 24 h was used as an index of constrictive MVEC remodeling. Gels in the absence or presence of Hcy were incubated with muscimol or baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist. The results suggested that Hcy-mediated MVEC collagen gel constriction was ameliorated by muscimol, baclofen, MMP-9, and eNOS gene ablations. There was no effect of anti-alpha 3 integrin. However, Hcy-mediated brain MVEC collagen constriction was abrogated with anti-beta-1 integrin. The co-incubation of Hcy with L-arginine ameliorated the Hcy-mediated collagen gel constriction. The results of this study indicated amelioration of Hcy-induced MVEC collagen gel constriction by induction of nitric oxide through GABA-A and -B receptors.

Arteriosclerosis and its complications, such as heart attack and stroke, are the major causes of death in developed countries. It was believed that age, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking are common risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, overwhelming clinical and epidemiological studies have identified homocysteine (Hcy) as a significant and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In healthy individuals, plasma Hcy is between 5 and 10 micromol/L. One cause of severe hypehomocys- teinemia (HHcy) is the deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which converts Hcy to cystathionine. CBS homozygous deficiency results in severe HHcy with Hcy levels up to 100 to 500 micromol/L. Patients with severe HHcy usually present with neurological abnormalities, premature arteriosclerosis. It has been reported that lowering plasma Hcy improved endothelial dysfunction and reduced incidence of major adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention. The mechanisms by which Hcy induces atherosclerosis are largely unknown. Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain cardiovascular pathological changes associated with HHcy. These include: (1) endothelial cell damage and impaired endothelial function; (2) dysregulation of cholesterol and triglyceride biosynthesis; (3) stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation; (4) thrombosis activation and (5) activation of monocytes. Four major biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the vascular pathology of Hcy. These include: (1) autooxidation through the production of reactive oxygen species; (2) hypomethylation by forming SAH, a potent inhibitor of biological transmethylations; (3) nitrosylation by binding to nitric oxide or (4) protein homocysteinylation by incorporating into protein. In summary, our studies, as well as data from other laboratories support the concept that Hcy is causally linked to atherosclerosis, and is not merely associated with the disease. Although folic acid, vitamin B12 and B6 can lower plasma Hcy levels, the long-term effects on cardiovascular disease risk are still unknown and judgments about therapeutic benefits await the findings of ongoing clinical trials.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is a consequence of impaired methionine/cysteine metabolism and is caused by deficiency of vitamins and/or enzymes such as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Although HHCY is an important and independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that are commonly associated with hepatic steatosis, the mechanism by which homocysteine promotes the development of fatty liver is poorly understood. CBS-deficient (CBS(-/-)) mice were previously generated by targeted deletion of the Cbs gene and exhibit pathological features similar to HHCY patients, including endothelial dysfunction and hepatic steatosis. Here we show abnormal lipid metabolism in CBS(-/-) mice. Triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid levels were markedly elevated in CBS(-/-) mouse liver and serum. The activity of thiolase, a key enzyme in beta-oxidation of fatty acids, was significantly impaired in CBS(-/-) mouse liver. Hepatic apolipoprotein B100 levels were decreased, whereas serum apolipoprotein B100 and very low density lipoprotein levels were elevated in CBS(-/-) mice. Serum levels of cholesterol/phospholipid in high density lipoprotein fractions but not of total cholesterol/phospholipid were decreased, and the activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was severely impaired in CBS(-/-) mice. Abnormal high density lipoprotein particles with higher mobility in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were observed in serum obtained from CBS(-/-) mice. Moreover, serum cholesterol/triglyceride distribution in lipoprotein fractions was altered in CBS(-/-) mice. These results suggest that hepatic steatosis in CBS(-/-) mice is caused by or associated with abnormal lipid metabolism.

Increased homocysteine is associated with the pregnancy complication preeclampsia and with later-life cardiovascular disease. Although elevated homocysteine persists after pregnancy, the vascular changes of preeclampsia abate with delivery, and cardiovascular disease occurs decades later. This suggests the vasculature during pregnancy may manifest increased sensitivity to homocysteine. We used the cystathionine-beta synthase (CBS)-deficient transgenic mouse to investigate whether hyperhomocysteinemia would differentially affect vascular function in nonpregnant and pregnant animals. Mesenteric arteries from nonpregnant and midpregnant (14 to 16 days) wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous CBS-deficient transgenic mice were investigated for their response to vasoconstriction, endothelial-dependent, and endothelial-independent relaxation using an isometric wire myograph system. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was similar in arteries from nonpregnant heterozygous and wild-type mice. In contrast, endothelial-dependent relaxation was reduced significantly in arteries from pregnant heterozygous animals compared with wild-type mice. Inhibition of NO synthesis blunted relaxation in arteries from pregnant wild-type but not pregnant heterozygous mice. Endothelial-dependent relaxation was restored by in vitro pretreatment with the tetrahydrobiopterin precursor sepiapterin. These data indicate that in pregnant mice, endothelial-dependent vasodilation is more sensitive to the effect of increased homocysteine than arteries from nonpregnant mice. This effect appears to result from a loss in NO-mediated relaxation that may be mediated by the oxidative inactivation of the NO synthase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Mutations in the enzymes responsible for homocysteine metabolism, particularly cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), result in severe forms of HHcy. Additionally, nutritional deficiencies in B vitamin cofactors required for homocysteine metabolism, including folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), and/or B12 (methylcobalamin), can induce HHcy. Studies using animal models of genetic- and diet-induced HHcy have recently demonstrated a causal relationship between HHcy, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Dietary enrichment in B vitamins attenuates these adverse effects of HHcy. Although oxidative stress and activation of proinflammatory factors have been proposed to explain the atherogenic effects of HHcy, recent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that HHcy induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This review summarizes the current role of HHcy in endothelial dysfunction and explores the cellular mechanisms, including ER stress, that contribute to atherothrombosis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperhomocysteinemia is an emerging risk factor for stroke, but little is known about effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on cerebral vascular function. We tested the hypothesis that chronic hyperhomocysteinemia in mice causes endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arterioles through a mechanism that involves superoxide.METHODS: Mice heterozygous for a targeted disruption of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (Cbs+/-) and their wild type littermates (Cbs+/+) were fed either a control diet or a high-methionine diet for 10 to 12 months.RESULTS: Plasma total homocysteine was elevated with the high-methionine diet compared with the control diet for both Cbs+/+ (7.9+/-1.0 versus 5.0+/-0.5 micromol/L; P&lt;0.05) and Cbs+/- (20.5+/-3.1 versus 8.2+/-0.9 micromol/L; P&lt;0.001) mice. Dilatation of cerebral arterioles ( approximately 30 microm baseline diameter) was measured in vivo in response to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine or the endothelium-independent dilator nitroprusside. Vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired with the high-methionine diet compared with the control diet for both Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/- mice (P&lt;0.01). Dilatation of arterioles to acetylcholine was restored toward normal by the superoxide scavenger tiron (P&lt;0.05). Vasodilatation to nitroprusside was not influenced by Cbs genotype or diet. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining for vascular superoxide was elevated in Cbs+/- mice fed the high-methionine diet and was inhibited by apocynin or Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, implicating NAD(P)H oxidase and nitric oxide synthase as potential sources of superoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Superoxide is a key mediator of endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral circulation during diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia.

As the average human lifespan increases, so does the recognition that advancing age is associated with changes in nutrient intake and requirements as a consequence of biological, social, and pathological factors. Studies show that whereas protein requirements may not differ significantly between younger and older adults, the adaptive mechanisms and responses to nutritional or pathological stressors may differ and alter the balance between requirement and toxicity of specific amino acids (AAs). As an individual gets older, cardiovascular disease and cancer become the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Advancing age is also associated with changes in appetite, food intake, and physical activity, all of which can influence protein and AA metabolism. The sulfur amino acids (SAAs) methionine and cysteine recently attracted attention because of their pivotal roles in methyl group metabolism and maintenance of the cellular redox state. Methionine, an indispensable AA, is important for methylation reactions and as a precursor for cysteine, which is the rate-limiting AA for glutathione (GSH) synthesis. On one hand, high intake levels or blood concentrations of methionine are associated with adverse consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia and endothelial dysfunction, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, methionine deficiency is reported to lower the threshold of chemical-induced toxicity and play a role in carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is evident that understanding the biological significance of the interrelationship between SAAs, GSH, and methyl group metabolism is key to determining optimal dietary intakes of SAAs in older individuals.

Atherosclerosis is an important medical problem of the 21st century, but traditional risk factors could only account for 50% of the problem. Hyperhomocysteinemia is emerging as an independent atherosclerosis risk factor, associated with folate deficiency, renal failure, and relative deficiency of MTHFR (C677T polymorphism) or other enzymes depending on gender, age, and smoking status. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to occur in 11-22% of western people, in 3-5% of normal asymptomatic Chinese subjects aged 18-70 years in Hong Kong, Macau, Sydney, and San Francisco, 23-36% of Chinese in Hong Kong with premature coronary artery disease, and 29% of a nonselective series of coronary subjects in Hong Kong. Evidence is accumulating that documents its associations with atherosclerosis disease in both case-control observations and prospective cohort studies, in vitro experiments, and in vivo experimental models in both animals and human subjects, as well as the successful improvement by homocysteine-lowering of endothelial function as surrogate atherosclerosis endpoints in asymptomatic human and coronary patients (secondary prevention). A number of large scale homocysteine-lowering trials are currently underway for stroke and heart attacks prevention. Collectively these trials will include more than 65,000 patients at high-risk for cardiovascular and stroke events, and should provide a reliable evidence-base for prevention.

To test the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia was due to increased levels of nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in response to antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) -/+ mice were bred, tail tissue was analyzed for genotype by PCR, and tail vein blood was analyzed for homocysteine (Hcy) by spectrofluorometry. To induce PPAR-alpha, mice were administered 8 microg/ml of ciprofibrate (CF) and grouped: 1) wild type (WT), 2) WT + CF, 3) CBS, 4) CBS + CF (n = 6 in each group). In these four groups of mice, plasma Hcy was 3.0 +/- 0.2, 2.5 +/- 1.2, 15.2 +/- 2.6 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 11.0 +/- 2.9 micromol/l. Mouse urinary protein was 110 +/- 11, 86 +/- 6, 179 +/- 13, 127 +/- 9 microg.day(-1). kg(-1) by Bio-Rad dye binding assay. Aortic nitrotyrosine was 0.099 +/- 0.012, 0.024 +/- 0.004, 0.132 +/- 0.024 (P &lt; 0.01 compared with WT), 0.05 +/- 0.01 (scan unit) by Western analysis.

Systolic blood pressure (SPB) was 90 +/- 2, 88 +/- 16, 104 +/- 8 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 96 +/- 3 mmHg. Aortic wall stress [(SPB. radius(2)/wall thickness)/2(radius + wall thickness)] was 10.2 +/- 1.9, 9.7 +/- 0.2, 16.6 +/- 0.8 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 13.1 +/- 2.1 dyn/cm(2). The results suggest that Hcy increased aortic wall stress by increasing nitrotyrosine and MMP-9 activity.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effects of short- and long-term vitamin C therapy on endothelial dysfunction in patients with homocystinuria.BACKGROUND: Untreated homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is associated with premature atherothrombotic disease; 25% of untreated patients suffer a vascular event by the age of 16 years and 50% by 29 years. Treatment directed at reducing homocysteine accumulation significantly reduces this risk. However, despite 'optimal' treatment and compliance, hyperhomocysteinaemia usually persists and individuals exhibit endothelial dysfunction indicative of an adverse cardiovascular prognosis. Additional intervention is therefore required to further reduce cardiovascular risk.METHODS: We investigated the endothelial effects of acute (2 g single dose) and chronic (1 g/day for 6 months) administration of oral vitamin C in 5 patients with homocystinuria (mean age 26 years, 1 male) and 5 age- and sex-matched controls. Brachial artery endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent responses to nitroglycerin (NTG) were measured using high-resolution ultrasonic vessel wall-tracking.RESULTS: Baseline: Plasma total homocysteine was 100.8 +/- 61.6 and 9.2 +/- 1.9 micromol/L in the patient and control groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). FMD responses were impaired in the patient group (20 +/- 40 microm) compared with the controls (116 +/- 30 microm) (p &lt; 0.001). Vitamin C administration: FMD responses in the patient group improved both acutely, 160 +/- 65 microm at 4 h (p &lt; 0.001), and chronically, 170 +/- 70 microm at 2 weeks (p &lt; 0.001) and 170 +/- 40 microm at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001). FMD responses in the control group were unaltered (p = 0.526). Within both groups, neither the vascular response to NTG nor plasma homocysteine was altered (p &gt; 0.4).CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in patients with homocystinuria, independent of changes in homocysteine concentration and should therefore be considered as an additional adjunct to therapy to reduce the potential long-term risk of atherothrombotic disease.

Previous in vitro experiments have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia leads to oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide, in part by inhibiting the expression of cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1). To elucidate the role of intracellular redox status on homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidant stress, heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS(-/+)) and wild-type (CBS(+/+)) mice were treated with the cysteine donor L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC). CBS(-/+) mice had significantly lower GPx-1 activity compared with their CBS(+/+) littermates, and OTC treatment led to a modest increase in tissue GPx-1 activity and significant increases in total thiols and in reduced glutathione levels in both CBS(+/+) and CBS(-/+) mice. Superfusion of the mesentery with beta-methacholine or bradykinin produced dose-dependent vasodilation of mesenteric arterioles in CBS(+/+) mice and in CBS(+/+) mice treated with OTC. In contrast, mesenteric arterioles from CBS(-/+) mice manifested dose-dependent vasoconstriction in response to both agonists. OTC treatment of CBS(-/+) mice restored normal microvascular vasodilator reactivity to beta-methacholine and bradykinin. These findings demonstrate that mild hyperhomocysteinemia leads to endothelial dysfunction in association with decreased bioavailable nitric oxide. Increasing the cellular thiol and reduced glutathione pools and increasing GPx-1 activity restores endothelial function. These findings emphasize the importance of intracellular redox balance for nitric oxide bioactivity and endothelial function.

Homocyst(e)ine (Hcy) inhibits the expression of the antioxidant enzyme cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) in vitro and in vivo, which can lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species that inactivate NO and promote endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of GPx-1 can restore the normal endothelial phenotype in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic states. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS((-/+))) mice and their wild-type littermates (CBS((+/+))) were crossbred with mice that overexpress GPx-1 [GPx-1((tg+)) mice]. GPx-1 activity was 28% lower in CBS((-/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) compared with CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) mice (P &lt; 0.05), and CBS((-/+)) and CBS((+/+)) mice overexpressing GPx-1 had 1.5-fold higher GPx-1 activity compared with GPx-1 nontransgenic mice (P &lt; 0.05). Mesenteric arterioles of CBS((-/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) mice showed vasoconstriction to superfusion with beta-methacholine and bradykinin (P &lt; 0.001 vs. all other groups), whereas nonhyperhomocyst(e)inemic mice [CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) and CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg+)) mice] demonstrated dose-dependent vasodilation in response to both agonists. Overexpression of GPx-1 in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic mice restored the normal endothelium-dependent vasodilator response. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were transiently transfected with GPx-1 and incubated with dl-homocysteine (HcyH) or l-cysteine. HcyH incubation decreased GPx-1 activity in sham-transfected BAEC (P &lt; 0.005) but not in GPx-1-transfected cells. Nitric oxide release from BAEC was significantly decreased by HcyH but not cysteine, and GPx-1 overexpression attenuated this decrease. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of GPx-1 can compensate for the adverse effects of Hcy on endothelial function and suggest that the adverse vascular effects of Hcy are at least partly mediated by oxidative inactivation of NO.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, but it is not certain whether it is a mediator of vascular dysfunction or a marker for another risk factor. Homocysteine levels are regulated by folate bioavailability and also by the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and its metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). We tested the hypotheses that endothelial dysfunction occurs in hyperhomocysteinemic mice in the absence of folate deficiency and that levels of SAM and SAH are altered in mice with dysfunction. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS(+/-)) and wild-type (CBS(+/+)) mice were fed a folate-replete, methionine-enriched diet. Plasma levels of total homocysteine were elevated in CBS(+/-) mice compared with CBS(+/+) mice after 7 weeks (27.1+/-5.2 versus 8.8+/-1.1 micromol/L; P&lt;0.001) and 15 weeks (23.9+/-3.0 versus 13.0+/-2.3 micromol/L; P&lt;0.01). After 15 weeks, but not 7 weeks, relaxation of aortic rings to acetylcholine was selectively impaired by 35% (P&lt;0.05) and thrombomodulin anticoagulant activity was decreased by 20% (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) mice. Plasma levels of folate did not differ between groups. Levels of SAH were elevated approximately 2-fold in liver and brain of CBS(+/-) mice, and correlations were observed between plasma total homocysteine and SAH in liver (r=0.54; P&lt;0.001) and brain (r=0.67; P&lt;0.001). These results indicate that endothelial dysfunction occurs in hyperhomocysteinemic mice even in the absence of folate deficiency. Endothelial dysfunction in CBS(+/-) mice was associated with increased tissue levels of SAH, which suggests that altered SAM-dependent methylation may contribute to vascular dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Over the last 30 years, a growing body of evidence has documented the role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) as an independent vascular risk factor. However, the mechanisms through which elevated circulating levels of homocysteine (Hcy) cause vascular injury and promote thrombosis remain elusive. Most findings have been achieved in in vitro studies employing exceedingly high concentrations of Hcy, whereas only a few studies have been carried out in vivo in humans. In homocystinuric patients, homozygotes for mutations of the gene coding for the cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme, abnormalities of coagulation variables reflecting a hypercoagulable state, have been reported. In vitro studies provide a biochemical background for such a state. In homocystinuric patients, an in vivo platelet activation has also been reported. The latter abnormality is not corrected by the bolus infusion of concentrations of hirudin, which determines a long-lasting impairment of the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin; in contrast, it appears at least in part lowered by the administration of the antioxidant drug probucol. During the autooxidation of Hcy in plasma, reactive oxygen species are generated. The latter initiate lipid peroxidation in cell membranes (potentially responsible for endothelial dysfunction) and in circulating lipoproteins. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) may trigger platelet activation as well as some of the hemostatic abnormalities reported in such patients. Thus the oxidative stress induced by Hcy may be a key process in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in HHcy. Accumulation of adenosylhomocysteine in cells (a consequence of high circulating levels of homocysteine) inhibits methyltransferase enzymes, in turn preventing repair of aged or damaged cells. This mechanism has been recently documented in patients with renal failure and HHcy and provides an additional direction to be followed to understand the tendency to thrombosis in moderate HHcy.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thrombosis. Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with impaired endothelial function, but the mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia are poorly understood. We have used genetic and dietary approaches to produce hyperhomocysteinemia in mice. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice (CBS +/-), which have a selective defect in homocysteine transsulfuration, and wild-type (CBS +/+) littermates were fed either a control diet or a diet that is relatively deficient in folic acid for 6 wk. Plasma total homocysteine was 5.3 +/- 0.7 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 6.4 +/- 0.6 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.3) given the control diet. Plasma total homocysteine was 11.6 +/- 4.5 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 25.1 +/- 3.2 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.004) given a low-folate diet. In mice fed the control diet, relaxation of aortic rings in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine did not differ significantly between CBS +/+ mice and CBS +/- mice. In contrast, in mice fed a low-folate diet, maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was markedly impaired in CBS +/- mice (58 +/- 9%) compared with CBS +/+ mice (84 +/- 4%) (P = 0.01). No differences in relaxation to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside were observed among the four groups of mice. These data indicate that CBS-deficient mice are predisposed to hyperhomocysteinemia during dietary folate deficiency, and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with marked impairment of endothelial function in mice.

Homocysteine is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications. We have employed an animal model to explore the hypothesis that an increase in reactive oxygen species and a subsequent loss of nitric oxide bioactivity contribute to endothelial dysfunction in mild hyperhomocysteinemia. We examined endothelial function and in vivo oxidant burden in mice heterozygous for a deletion in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, by studying isolated, precontracted aortic rings and mesenteric arterioles in situ. CBS(-/+) mice demonstrated impaired acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation and a paradoxical vasoconstriction of mesenteric microvessels in response to superfusion of methacholine and bradykinin. Cyclic GMP accumulation following acetylcholine treatment was also impaired in isolated aortic segments from CBS(-/+) mice, but aortic relaxation and mesenteric arteriolar dilation in response to sodium nitroprusside were similar to wild-type. Plasma levels of 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) (8-IP) were somewhat increased in CBS(-/+) mice, but liver levels of 8-IP and phospholipid hydroperoxides, another marker of oxidative stress, were normal. Aortic tissue from CBS(-/+) mice also demonstrated greater superoxide production and greater immunostaining for 3-nitrotyrosine, particularly on the endothelial surface. Importantly, endothelial dysfunction appears early in CBS(-/+) mice in the absence of structural arterial abnormalities. Hence, mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to reduced CBS expression impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation, likely due to impaired nitric oxide bioactivity, and increased oxidative stress apparently contributes to inactivating nitric oxide in chronic, mild hyperhomocysteinemia.

The sulfur-containing amino acid, homocysteine, is formed from the essential amino acid methionine, and a number of B vitamins are involved in methionine metabolism. Pyridoxine, vitamin B6, is a cofactor for cystathionine beta synthase, which mediates the transformation of homocysteine to cystathionine, the initial step in the transsulfuration pathway and the urinary excretion of sulfur. In a normal diet there is conservation of the carbon skeleton, and about 50% of the homocysteine formed is remethylated to methionine via steps that require folic acid and vitamin B12. A deficiency of any of these three vitamins leads to modest homocyst(e)ine elevation, as does diminished renal function, both of which are common in the elderly. It is also established that homocyst(e)ine elevation of this order is associated with increased cardiovascular risk but is also associated with most established risk factors, although it is thought to be an independent contributor. In the inborn error of metabolism homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency there is greatly increased circulating homocyst(e)ine and a clear association with precocious vascular disease. In about 50% of these patients there is a vascular event before the age of 30 years. The homocysteine-induced adverse vascular changes appear to result from endothelial and smooth muscle cell effects and increased thrombogenesis. We have documented a highly significant reduction in the occurrence of vascular events during 539 patient years of treatment in 32 patients with cystathionine beta synthase deficiency (mean age 30 years, range 9-66 years) by aggressive homocyst(e)ine lowering with pyridoxine, folic acid, and B12 (p = 0.0001). The 15 pyridoxine nonresponsive patients also received oral betaine. Although a cause and effect relationship is postulated for the increased cardiovascular risk associated with mild homocysteine elevation, a common cause of this elevation is the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. Homozygotes occur in about 11% of Caucasian populations. However, the mutation is not associated with increased coronary risk. Since mild homocysteine elevation is easily normalized by B vitamin supplementation, usually with folic acid, it remains for controlled clinical trials of this inexpensive therapy to determine whether normalizing mild homocyst(e)ine elevation reduces cardiovascular risk.

The possibility that modest elevations in the level of blood homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinaemia) could contribute to cardiovascular disease arose from investigation of patients with rare, severe homocysteine elevations caused by cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Such patients often had thromboembolic events before the age of 30 years. Since the established cardiovascular risk factors could only partly account for the occurrence and severity of vascular disease in the general population, other risk factors had to exist, and homocysteine elevation seemed to be a possible candidate. Australian case-control studies identified an association between mild homocysteine elevation and early-onset coronary disease, and also with chronic renal failure. Patients in the latter group have a high prevalence of unexplained vascular disease and particularly high homocysteine levels. Such elevations in levels of homocysteine in vascular patients could usually be normalised by daily supplementation with folic acid (1-5 mg) while in patients with chronic renal failure 5 mg of folic acid daily markedly reduced the increased concentrations of homocysteine. These initial observations have been confirmed by many investigators and biologically plausible mechanisms for homocysteine-induced vascular dysfunction, and particularly endothelial dysfunction, have been identified. However, associations between hyperhomocysteinaemia and other risk factors, such as smoking and hypertension, have also been documented and need to be controlled for when assessing any increase in risk that homocysteine may independently confer. Although it has been established that lowering the greatly elevated blood homocysteine levels in homocystinuria, due to cystathione beta-synthase deficiency, unquestionably reduces cardiovascular risk, it remains to be determined whether normalising mild homocysteine elevation could reduce cardiovascular risk. Trials to test this possibility have been initiated and others are planned.

The objectives were firstly to assess the evidence that homocysteine is a significant and independent risk factor for vascular disease with special reference to cardiovascular disease, and secondly to evaluate the evidence that a food staple fortified with folic acid will reduce this problem on a population basis. The structure of plasma homocysteine (tHcy) is described. Homocysteine, a highly reactive compound, is synthesized from the amino acid, methionine, and is metabolized by two pathways, the catabolic transsulphuration route via cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and the remethylation path using 5-methyltetrahy-drofolate polyglutamate, the product of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; EC 1.1.1.171), via the cobalamin dependent enzyme, methionine synthase (MS; EC 2.1.1.13).The mechanisms whereby hyper-tHcy is produced include both increased rates of synthesis and decreased metabolism. The latter may occur owing to nutritional deficiency of the vitamin cofactors which are necessary for the normal function of the metabolic enzymes. In particular, folate is required for methylene reductase, pyridoxal phosphate for cystathionine synthase and cobalamin for methionine synthase. When these vitamins are deficient hyper-tHcy is induced and this occurs especially in the elderly. Alternatively, a variant form of methylene reductase has recently been described which occurs in nearly 10% of the normal population. This variant is associated with hyper-tHcy, especially in situations associated with a low folate nutritional status. Meta-analysis of both retrospective case-control studies, nested prospective case-control surveys and a secondary trial of mortality in postmyocardial infarct patients have shown that the association of hyper-tHcy with vascular disease is beyond doubt. This has been further supported by direct assessments of the degree of vascular disease in the carotid brachial and aortic arteries in relation to tHcy levels. Furthermore, treatment with a cocktail of the vitamin cofactors has produced lowering of tHcy levels and regression of the vascular disease in the carotid arteries of affected individuals. Suggested pathogenic mechanisms in vascular disease induced by hyper-tHcy include vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, smooth muscle proliferation and derangements of normal intravascular regulation mechanisms. A variety of clinical conditions are known to be associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic complications. Some of these are associated with hyper-tHcy. Low physiological doses of folic acid, as well as pharmocological doses, lower tHcy. However, because of the poor bioavailability of food folate (50%) and the considerable chemical instability of the naturally occurring reduced forms of folate, in most people it would require unacceptably high consumption of green vegetables to accomplish the necessary increase in intracellular folate and reduction in tHcy. Accordingly, folic acid, the nonreduced synthetic form of the vitamin, which is 100% bioavailable and chemically extremely stable, should be added to a food staple such as flour to ensure maximum protection for most of the population.

The mechanism by which homocysteine causes endothelial cell (EC) injury and/or dysfunction is not fully understood. To examine the stress-inducing effects of homocysteine on ECs, mRNA differential display and cDNA microarrays were used to evaluate changes in gene expression in cultured human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to homocysteine. Here we show that homocysteine increases the expression of GRP78 and GADD153, stress-response genes induced by agents or conditions that adversely affect the function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Induction of GRP78 was specific for homocysteine because other thiol-containing amino acids, heat shock or H2O2 did not appreciably increase GRP78 mRNA levels. Homocysteine failed to elicit an oxidative stress response in HUVEC because it had no effect on the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) including HSP70, nor did it activate heat shock transcription factor 1. Furthermore homocysteine blocked the H2O2-induced expression of HSP70. In support of our findings in vitro, steady-state mRNA levels of GRP78, but not HSP70, were elevated in the livers of cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice with hyperhomocysteinaemia. These studies indicate that the activation of stress response genes by homocysteine involves reductive stress leading to altered ER function and is in contrast with that of most other EC perturbants. The observation that homocysteine also decreases the expression of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and natural killer-enhancing factor B suggests that homocysteine could potentially enhance the cytotoxic effect of agents or conditions known to cause oxidative stress.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CS) deficiency is the most common inborn error of methionine metabolism. Patients with CS-deficiency have an extremely high risk of vascular disease. The underlying mechanism is still unsolved. Dysfunction of endothelial cells could be the trigger in the formation of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Therefore, differences in cell function were studied between normal and CS-deficient human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in culture media as a measure of homocysteine export increased in all cell lines, including the cell line with CS-deficiency, with constant amounts of approximately 2.5 microM every 24 h. von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in culture media were used as markers of endothelial function and increased also with progression of culture time. The effects of additions of folate, vitamin B6 and methionine to the culture medium were studied. The homocysteine export and the markers of endothelial function did not differ between the control and the CS-deficient HUVECs under various test conditions. These data show that CS-deficient endothelial cells have normal homocysteine export and normal endothelial cell function. In CS-deficient patients the very high blood levels of homocysteine, probably due to deficient CS function in liver and kidney, seems to be the hazardous factor to endothelial cells, thus promoting atherosclerosis and thrombosis in CS-deficient patients.

BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease complicated by early and aggressive occlusive arterial disease. This may be related to the grossly increased homocysteine concentrations seen in this disease. More recently, milder hyperhomocysteinemia has been proposed as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease.SUMMARY: Many patients with homozygous homocystinuria develop severe premature atherosclerosis and thromboembolism, probably caused by abnormally high concentrations of homocysteine. Homocysteine undergoes metabolism either by remethylation or transsulfuration, and deficiency or dysfunction of any of the substances that regulate these reactions may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine may have adverse effects on platelets, clotting factors, and endothelial cells. Studies have demonstrated significantly higher plasma homocysteine levels in patients with occlusive arterial disease than in controls. The causes are not clearly understood but may include deficiency of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid and heterozygosity for cystathionine synthase deficiency. Vitamin supplementation can lower plasma homocysteine levels.CONCLUSIONS: Whether measuring plasma homocysteine levels in patients with coronary artery disease should be routine and whether treating hyperhomocysteinemia in these patients may reduce the risk of coronary events remains to be determined.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia are inherited disorders of metabolism that are associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease. This study addresses the possibility that different patterns of carotid wall damage and cerebral blood flow hemodynamics are present in these two metabolic diseases.METHODS: Twelve patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (mean age, 24 years), 10 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (mean age, 26 years), and 11 healthy control subjects (mean age, 26 years) underwent a vascular examination by noninvasive methods. B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to obtain measurements of intima-media thickness of common carotid, bifurcation, and internal carotid arteries as an index of atherosclerosis. Cerebral blood flow velocity was estimated from vascular examination of the middle cerebral artery by transcranial Doppler. Systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities were measured. Pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was also calculated.RESULTS: Mean maximum intima-media thickness was 1.4 mm in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, 0.6 mm in patients with homocystinuria, and 0.6 mm in control subjects. The difference between hypercholesterolemic and homocystinuric patients or control subjects was statistically significant (P &lt; .001). Diastolic blood flow velocities were significantly reduced in the middle cerebral arteries of hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or control subjects (P &lt; .05), whereas systolic or mean velocities did not differ. The pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was significantly higher in hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or healthy control subjects (P &lt; .01). A direct relation was demonstrated between pulsatility index of the middle cerebral artery and mean maximum intima-media thickness of carotid arteries on the same side (P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Familial hypercholesterolemia is responsible for diffuse and focal thickening of carotid arteries and possibly also for hyperlipidemic endothelial dysfunction extending to small resistance arteries and leading to a disturbed cerebral blood flow. Patients with homocystinuria due to homozygosis for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency seldom have plaques in their carotid arteries. They are similar to healthy control subjects with regard to both intima-media thickness and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. Therefore, it is unlikely that typical atherosclerotic lesions precede thrombotic events in homocystinuria. However, it is possible that arterial dilatations caused by medial damage lead to thrombosis in homocystinuric patients.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: A phase 1/2 clinical trial was performed in individuals with cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) deficient homocystinuria with aims to: (a) assess pharmacokinetics and safety of taurine therapy, (b) evaluate oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular function in CBS deficiency, and (c) evaluate the impact of short-term taurine treatment.METHODS: Individuals with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency with homocysteine &gt;50<U+2009>µM, without inflammatory disorder or on antioxidant therapy were enrolled. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]), and disease-related metabolites obtained at baseline were compared to normal values. While maintaining current treatment, patients were treated with 75<U+2009>mg/kg taurine twice daily, and treatment response assessed after 4 hours and 4 days.RESULTS: Fourteen patients (8-35<U+2009>years; 8 males, 6 females) were enrolled with baseline homocysteine levels 161<U+2009>±<U+2009>67<U+2009>µM. The study found high-dose taurine to be safe when excluding preexisting hypertriglyceridemia. Taurine pharmacokinetics showed a rapid peak level returning to near normal levels at 12<U+2009>hours, but had slow accumulation and elevated predosing levels after 4 days of treatment. Only a single parameter of oxidative stress, 2,3-dinor-8-isoprostaglandin-F2a, was elevated at baseline, with no elevated inflammatory parameters, and no change in FMD values overall. Taurine had no effect on any of these parameters. However, the effect of taurine was strongly related to pretreatment FMD values; and taurine significantly improved FMD in the subset of individuals with pretreatment FMD values &lt;10% and in individuals with homocysteine levels &gt;125<U+2009>µM, pertinent to endothelial function.CONCLUSION: Taurine improves endothelial function in CBS-deficient homocystinuria in patients with preexisting reduced function.

The combination of traditional Chinese medicines can improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. Furthermore, the combination of the traditional Chinese medicine curcuma zedoary and kelp was used to enhance the effect of the dissipation of blood stasis in pediatrics during the Song Dynasty. Curcumenol and laminarin, the main components of curcuma zedoary and kelp, are also reported to have a wide range of biological activities. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp may prevent the development of cancer. The aim of this research was to confirm whether a combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of hepatoma cells and consequently improve prognosis. In this study, we firstly found in H22-bearing mice that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp inhibited tumor growth and the expression of metastasis-related proteins (MMPs, VEGF, pAkt, pERK1/2). Meanwhile, the decreased cystathionine beta synthase (CBS, an endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthetase) level was also observed in H22-bearing mice admistrated with the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp. It was also observed that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the potential inhibiting mechanism of the combination of curcumenol and laminarin on HepG2 cell proliferation and metastasis. Our previous research showed that a CBS/H2S system was vital for maintaining the proliferation in hepatoma cells. Here, we found that the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 were decreased in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells and the combination of curcumenol and laminarin significantly decreased the H2S level in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 in HepG2 cells. Angiogenesis, positively regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is essential for human cancer metastasis. In the present study, we found that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin could significantly down-regulate the expression levels of VEGF and its downstream key genes pAkt and pERK1/2. Furthermore, previous research showed that hydrogen sulfide could stimulate angiogenesis. Here, we also observed the reduction of the VEGF, Akt, pAkt, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 proteins levels and the inhibition of proliferation and metastasis in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells. Moreover, exogenous H2S rescued the cytological results caused by the combination of curcumenol and laminarin. Taken together, the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting endogenous H2S production and down-regulating the pSTAT3/BCL-2 and VEGF pathway, which provides strong evidence for the application of curcuma zedoary and kelp in treatments of liver cancer.

AIMS: The induction of excessive autophagy by increased levels of oxidative stress is one of the main mechanisms underlying unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to have an anti-oxidative effect, but its mode of action on excessive autophagy in vascular endothelial cells is unclear.METHODS: Surgery was used to induce UUO in male C57BL/6 mice as an in vivo model. Human renal epithelial cells (HK-2) were treated with H2O2 as an in vitro model. NaHS was used as an exogenous H2S donor. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to observe the structure of renal autophagosomes. The expression of proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis was detected by western blot analysis in vivo and in vitro. Flow cytometry (DCFH-DA) was used to examine the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to detect cell apoptosis. Compound C was used to analyze the association of AMPK with autophagy.RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, in which the ureter was exposed but not ligated, the cell apoptosis index, number of autophagosomes, protein expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (LC3)-II/I, beclin-1, and p-AMPK/AMPK were significantly increased in the UUO group. On the other hand, p62, cystathionine ß-synthase, and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase protein expression levels and H2S concentration were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). These alterations were ameliorated by the addition of NaHS (p &lt; 0.05). Similar results were observed in vitro. By using the AMPK inhibitor compound C, it was indicated that AMPK was involved in ROS-induced autophagy. In addition, using tissue from patients with obstructive nephropathy, excessive autophagy was observed by an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.CONCLUSION: NaHS-treatment may exert a protective effect on mouse kidney against UUO by suppressing the ROS-AMPK pathway. ROS-AMPK-mediated autophagy may represent a promising therapeutic target for obstructive nephropathy.

Hyper- and hypothyroidism are some of the most common endocrinopathies that cause many metabolic disorders including amino acids metabolism. However, a specific molecular mechanism of thyroid hormones influence on sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism has not been established. The aim of our research was to investigate experimentally the influence of thyroid gland functional state on the main enzymatic systems of sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism in liver and kidneys, the content of homocysteine, cysteine and H2S in blood. The rats were administered with L-thyroxine and mercazolil to simulate the states of hyper- and hypothyroidism, which were confirmed by the content of fT3, fT4 and TSH in the blood. In liver and kidneys of the animals with hypothyroidism we observed the decrease in the activity of enzymes of remethylation cycle of S-adenosylmethioninsyntase, S-adenosylhomocysteinhyhdrolase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. Suppression of transsulfuration transformation of homocysteine to cysteine in hypothyroidism was mainly due to the inhibition of cystathionine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase, wherein cystathionase activity of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase was not changed. In animals with hypothyroidism we also noticed the inhibition of cysteine desulfunation reactions: the activity of enzymes of cystathionine-ß-synthase, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase and cysteine aminotransferase significantly decreased in liver and kidneys. Experimental hyperthyroidism was accompanied by increase in activity of remethylation cycle enzymes, increase in cystationine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase in liver and activity of these enzymes in kidneys. The simulation of hyperthyroidism led to the decrease of homocysteine concentration, and of hypothyroidism - to the increase of homocysteine and cysteine concentrations and reduced H2S content in blood of the animals. Thus, the significant risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulation in hypothyroid conditions may be the disorders in the processes of remethylation, transsulfuration, and desulfuration of sulphur-containing amino acids in organs.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with several human visual disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is linked to vision loss in DR and AMD. Our previous work revealed that HHcy altered BRB in retinal endothelial cells in vivo. Here we hypothesize that homocysteine (Hcy) alters retinal endothelial cell barrier function and angiogenic potential via activation of oxidative stress. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) treated with and without different concentrations of Hcy showed a reduction of tight junction protein expression, increased FITC dextran leakage, decreased transcellular electrical resistance and increased angiogenic potential. In addition, HRECs treated with Hcy showed increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduced ROS formation and decreased FITC-dextran leakage in Hcy treated HRECs. A mouse model of HHcy, in which cystathionine-ß-synthase is deficient (cbs <sup>-/-</sup>), was evaluated for oxidative stress by dichlolorofluorescein (DCF), dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. There was a marked increase in ROS production and augmented GSH reductase and antioxidant regulator NRF2 activity, but decreased antioxidant gene expression in retinas of hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Our results suggest activation of oxidative stress as a possible mechanism of HHcy induced retinal endothelial cell dysfunction.

METHODS: Anesthetized and instrumented FBM &quot;familial hypercholesterolemia Bretoncelles Meishan&quot; pigs with high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were subjected to polymicrobial septic shock, or sham procedure, and subsequent intensive care therapy for 24 h. Young German domestic pigs were used as naïve controls. CSE, CBS, 3-MST, HO-1, eNOS, and nitrotyrosine expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin sections.RESULTS: FBM pigs, in the absence of septic shock, showed decreased CSE expression in the media. This decrease became more pronounced after sepsis. The expression pattern of HO-1 resembled the pattern of CSE expression. CBS protein was not detected in the media of any of the CA examined but was localized to the adventitia and only in the atheromatous plaques containing foam cells of the CA, in regions that also displayed abundant nitrotyrosine formation. The CBS expression in the adventitia was not associated with nitrotyrosine formation. 3-MST expression was not found in any of the CA samples.CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that (i) the reduced CSE expression in FBM pigs may contribute to their cardiovascular disease phenotype and moreover (ii) the further decrease in CA CSE expression in sepsis may contribute to the sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction.

Cirrhosis is a end-stage disease of the liver in which fibrogenesis, angiogenesis and distortion of intrahepatic microcirculation lead to increased intrahepatic resistance to portal blood flow, a condition known as portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is maintained by a variety of molecular mechanisms including sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) hyporeactivity, activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), reduction in hepatic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity along with increased eNOS-derived NO generation in the splanchnic and systemic circulations. A reduction of the expression/function of the two major hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), has also been demonstrated. A deficit in the transsulfuration pathway leading to the accumulation of homocysteine might contribute to defective generation of H2S and endothelial hyporeactivity. Bile acids are ligands for nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the G-protein bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1). FXR and GPBAR1 ligands regulate the expression/activity of CSE by both genomic and non-genomic effects and have been proved effective in protecting against endothelial dysfunction observed in rodent models of cirrhosis. GPBAR1, a receptor for secondary bile acids, is selectively expressed by LSECs and its activation increases the expression of CSE and attenuates the production of endotelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor agent. In vivo GPBAR1 ligand attenuates the imbalance between vasodilatory and vaso-constricting agents, making GPBAR1 a promising target in the treatment of portal hypertension.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. The use of vitamins to modulate homocysteine metabolism substantially lowers the risk by reducing plasma homocysteine levels. In this study, we evaluated the effects of l-serine and related amino acids on homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and endothelial cell damage using EA.hy926 human endothelial cells. Homocysteine treatment decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, which were reversed by cotreatment with l-serine. l-Serine inhibited homocysteine-induced ER stress as verified by decreased glucose-regulated protein 78kDa (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression as well as X-box binding protein 1 (xbp1) mRNA splicing. The effects of l-serine on homocysteine-induced ER stress are not attributed to intracellular homocysteine metabolism, but instead to decreased homocysteine uptake. Glycine exerted effects on homocysteine-induced ER stress, apoptosis, and cell viability that were comparable to those of l-serine. Although glycine did not affect homocysteine uptake or export, coincubation of homocysteine with glycine for 24h reduced the intracellular concentration of homocysteine. Taken together, l-serine and glycine cause homocysteine-induced endothelial cell damage by reducing the level of intracellular homocysteine. l-Serine acts by competitively inhibiting homocysteine uptake in the cells. However, the mechanism(s) by which glycine lowers homocysteine levels are unclear.

Anemia of end stage renal disease affects 90% of patients on hemodialysis and it is a tremendous concern of patients and health care providers. Renal disease creates a state of renal hypoxia, which may contribute to a lack of erythropoietin production from the kidney when low oxygen levels are sensed. This necessitates the use of exogenous erythropoietin preparations.</AbstractText>: Anemia of end stage renal disease affects 90% of patients on hemodialysis and it is a tremendous concern of patients and health care providers. Renal disease creates a state of renal hypoxia, which may contribute to a lack of erythropoietin production from the kidney when low oxygen levels are sensed. This necessitates the use of exogenous erythropoietin preparations.Recent evidence suggests that endogenously derived hydrogen sulfide may mediate oxygen sensing in tissues. Given the known involvement of other small molecules such as nitric oxide in erythropoietin production and the observation of decreased urinary H2S levels in patients with renal failure, we postulated that H2S may be the primary mediator of erythropoietin production during hypoxia. PK1, 786-O and Hep3B cells were incubated in hypoxia (1% O2) for 24 hours. Hypoxic cells were treated with the H2S donor GYY 4137 and the H2S inhibitor hydroxylamine. Following hypoxia erythropoietin, HIF-1a, HIF-2a and CBS expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.</AbstractText>: Recent evidence suggests that endogenously derived hydrogen sulfide may mediate oxygen sensing in tissues.

Following hypoxia erythropoietin, HIF-1a, HIF-2a and CBS expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.Hydroxylamine administration led to a significant decrease in erythropoietin, HIF-1a, HIF-2a and CBS protein levels during hypoxia. This was rescued by administration of GYY 4137 for erythropoietin, CBS and HIF-2a. Additionally, CSE -/- mice placed in hypoxia for 72 hours showed decreased renal erythropoietin production compared to wild-type mice.</AbstractText>: Hydroxylamine administration led to a significant decrease in erythropoietin, HIF-1a, HIF-2a and CBS protein levels during hypoxia.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter. The levels of H2S-generating enzyme expression and endogenous H2S production in diabetic rats with erectile dysfunction (ED) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the H2S-generating enzymes and endogenous production of H2S in penile tissues of diabetic ED rats.METHODS: Experimental rats were randomly divided into normal control group, apomorphine (APO)-positive group and APO-negative group. Primary rat corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) and aortic endothelial cells (AECs) were isolated and cultured in vitro under 3 different conditions: normal glucose (NG) condition, high glucose (HG) condition, and osmotic control (OC) condition.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile function; H2S concentrations in plasma or penile tissues; expression of H2S-generating enzymes and endogenous H2S production in penile tissues, CCSMCs, and AECs.RESULTS: Erectile function was significantly decreasedin the APO-negative group. In addition to significantly decreased expression of cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), d-amino acid oxidase (DAO), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), the H2S concentrations in plasma and penile tissues and endogenous H2S production were significantly decreased in the APO-negative group. Endogenous H2S production by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) decreased to the same levels in the APO-negative and APO-positive groups as that in the normal control group. However, CBS and CSE expression remained unchanged in the 3 groups. Under HG conditions, H2S-generating enzyme expression in AECs did not change, while CAT, DAO, and 3-MST expression in CCSMCs was significantly decreased. In both cell types, H2S production by these enzymes was decreased in the HG group.CONCLUSION: Endogenous H2S production was significantly decreased in the diabetic ED rats' penile tissues due to downregulated expression of the CAT/3-MST and DAO/3-MST pathways and low activities of CBS and CSE.

INTRODUCTION: Resveratrol (RVT) found in red wine protects against erectile dysfunction and relaxes penile tissue (corpus cavernosum) via a nitric oxide (NO) independent pathway. However, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a potent vasodilator and neuromodulator generated in corpus cavernosum.AIMS: We investigated whether RVT caused the relaxation of mice corpus cavernosum (MCC) through H2 S.METHODS: H2 S formation is measured by methylene blue assay and vascular reactivity experiments have been performed by DMT strip myograph in CD1 MCC strips.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N<U+03C9>-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 0.1<U+2009>mM) or H2 S inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA, 2<U+2009>mM) which inhibits both cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) enzyme or combination of AOAA with PAG (CSE inhibitor) has been used in the presence/absence of RVT (0.1<U+2009>mM, 30<U+2009>min) to elucidate the role of NO or H2 S pathways on the effects of RVT in MCC. Concentration-dependent relaxations to RVT, L-cysteine, sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) and acetylcholine (ACh) were studied.RESULTS: Exposure of murine corpus cavernosum to RVT increased both basal and L-cysteine-stimulated H2 S formation. Both of these effects were reversed by AOAA but not by L-NNA. RVT caused concentration-dependent relaxation of MCC and that RVT-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG but not by L-NNA. L-cysteine caused concentration-dependent relaxations, which are inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG significantly. Incubation of MCC with RVT significantly increased L-cysteine-induced relaxation, and this effect was inhibited by AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG. However, RVT did not alter the effect of exogenous H2 S (NaHS) or ACh-induced relaxations.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that RVT-induced relaxation is at least partly dependent on H2 S formation and acts independent of eNOS pathway. In phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) nonresponder population, combination therapy with RVT may reverse erectile dysfunction via stimulating endogenous H2 S formation.

Deficiencies of the human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) enzyme are characterized by a plethora of vascular disorders and hyperhomocysteinemia. However, several clinical trials demonstrated that despite reduction in homocysteine levels, disease outcome remained unaffected, thus the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is poorly defined. Here, we show that the loss of CBS function in endothelial cells (ECs) leads to a significant down-regulation of cellular hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by 50% and of glutathione (GSH) by 40%. Silencing CBS in ECs compromised phenotypic and signaling responses to the VEGF that were potentiated by decreased transcription of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and neuropilin (NRP)-1, the primary receptors regulating endothelial function. Transcriptional down-regulation of VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 was mediated by a lack in stability of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which is a sulfhydration target of H2S at residues Cys68 and Cys755. Reinstating H2S but not GSH in CBS-silenced ECs restored Sp1 levels and its binding to the VEGFR-2 promoter and VEGFR-2, NRP-1 expression, VEGF-dependent proliferation, and migration phenotypes. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of CBS-mediated protein S-sulfhydration in maintaining vascular health and function.-Saha, S., Chakraborty, P. K., Xiong, X., Dwivedi, S. K. D., Mustafi, S.

In this chapter the role played by H2S in the physiopathology of urogenital tract revising animal and human data available in the current relevant literature is discussed. H2S pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the mechanism underlying penile erection in human and experimental animal. Both cystathionine-ß synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3> lyase (CSE) are expressed in the human corpus cavernosum and exogenous H2S relaxes isolated human corpus cavernosum strips in an endothelium-independent manner. Hydrogen sulfide pathway also accounts for the direct vasodilatory effect operated by testosterone on isolated vessels. Convincing evidence suggests that H2S can influence the cGMP pathway by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) activity. All these findings taken together suggest an important role for the H2S pathway in human corpus cavernosum homeostasis. However, H2S effect is not confined to human corpus cavernosum but also plays an important role in human bladder. Human bladder expresses mainly CBS and generates in vitro detectable amount of H2S. In addition the bladder relaxant effect of the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil involves H2S as mediator. In conclusion the H2S pathway is not only involved in penile erection but also plays a role in bladder homeostasis. In addition the finding that it involved in the mechanism of action of PDE-5 inhibitors strongly suggests that modulation of this pathway can represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and bladder diseases.

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (Hcy) level is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). During transsulfuration pathways, Hcy is metabolized into hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is a synaptic modulator, as well as a neuro-protective agent. However, the role of hydrogen sulfide, as well as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and synaptic dysfunction, leading to AD pathology is not clear. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibition of neuronal NMDA-R by H2S and MK801 mitigate the Hcy-induced BBB disruption and synapse dysfunction, in part by decreasing neuronal matrix degradation. Hcy intracerebral (IC) treatment significantly impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral circulation and memory function. Hcy treatment also decreases the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the brain along with increased expression of NMDA-R (NR1) and synaptosomal Ca(2+) indicating excitotoxicity. Additionally, we found that Hcy treatment increased protein and mRNA expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 and also increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in the brain. The increased expression of ICAM-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and claudin-5 indicates BBB disruption and vascular inflammation. Moreover, we also found decreased expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP-97), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), synaptophysin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) showing synapse dysfunction in the hippocampus. Furthermore, NaHS and MK801 treatment ameliorates BBB disruption, CBF, and synapse functions in the mice brain. These results demonstrate a neuro-protective effect of H2S over Hcy-induced cerebrovascular pathology through the NMDA receptor. Our present study clearly signifies the therapeutic ramifications of H2S for cerebrovascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Graphical Abstract <U+115F>.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) impairs re-endothelialization and accelerates vascular remodeling. The role of CD34(+)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2(+) progenitor cells (PCs) in vascular repair in HHcy is unknown. We studied the effect of HHcy on PCs and its role in vascular repair in severe HHcy (~150 µM), which was induced in cystathionine-ß synthase heterozygous mice fed a high-methionine diet for 8 weeks. Vascular injury was introduced by carotid air-dry endothelium denudation. CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells were examined by flow cytometry. HHcy reduced bone marrow (BM) CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells and suppressed replenishment of postinjury CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells in peripheral blood (PB). Donor green fluorescent protein-positive PC homing to the injured vessel was reduced in HHcy after CD34(+) PCs from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice were adoptively transferred following carotid injury. CD34(+) PC transfusion partially reversed HHcy-suppressed re-endothelialization and HHcy-induced neointimal formation. Furthermore, homocysteine (Hcy) inhibited proliferation, adhesion, and migration and suppressed ß1-integrin expression and activity in human CD34(+) endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) isolated from PBs in a dose-dependent manner. A functional-activating ß1-integrin antibody rescued Hcy-suppressed adhesion and migration in CD34(+) ECFCs. In conclusion, HHcy reduces BM CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) generation and suppresses CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cell mobilization and homing to the injured vessel via ß1-integrin inhibition, which partially contributes to impaired re-endothelialization and vascular remodeling.

AIM: To evaluate the effect of ginkgolide B treatment on vascular endothelial function in diabetic rats.METHODS: The study included four groups with 15 male Sprague-Dawley rats: control group; control group treated with ginkgolide B; diabetic group; and diabetic treated with ginkgolide B. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde content, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits, and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) protein expression were determined in aortic tissues. Vasoconstriction to phenylephrine (PHE) and vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were assessed in aortic rings. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were measured, as well as cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß synthetase (CBS) protein expression, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity.RESULTS: Diabetes significantly impaired PHE-induced vasoconstriction and Ach-induced vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), reduced NO bioavailability and H2S production (P&lt;0.001), SOD activity, and GPX1 protein expression (P&lt;0.001), and increased malondialdehyde content and NADPH oxidase subunits, and CSE and CBS protein expression (P&lt;0.001). Ginkgolide B treatment improved PHE vasoconstriction and Ach vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), restored SOD (P=0.005) and eNOS (P&lt;0.001) activities, H2S production (P=0.044) and decreased malondialdehyde content (P=0.014). Vasorelaxation to SNP was not signi<U+FB01>cantly different in control and diabetic rats with or without ginkgolide B treatment. Besides, ginkgolide B increased GPX1 protein expression and reduced NADPH oxidase subunits, CBS and CSE protein expression.CONCLUSION: Ginkgolide B alleviates endothelial dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and elevating NO bioavailability and H2S production in diabetic rats.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertension is a common clinical problem still poorly understood. The presence of GC receptor (GR) in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells suggests a direct role for GC in vasculature. In response to hemodynamic shear stress, endothelium tonically releases nitric oxide (NO), endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and prostacyclin contributing to vascular homeostasis. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been proposed as a candidate for EDHF. H2S is endogenously mainly formed from L-cysteine by the action of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). It plays many physiological roles and contributes to cardiovascular function. Here we have evaluated the role played by H2S in mesenteric arterial bed and in carotid artery harvested from rats treated with vehicle or dexamethasone (DEX; 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. During treatments systolic blood pressure was significantly increased in conscious rats. EDHF contribution was evaluated in ex-vivo by performing a concentration-response curve induced by acetylcholine (Ach) in presence of a combination of indomethacin and L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester in both vascular districts. EDHF-mediated relaxation was significantly reduced in DEX-treated group in both mesenteric bed and carotid artery. EDHF-mediated relaxation was abolished by pre-treatment with both apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of small and big calcium-dependent potassium channels respectively, or with propargylglycine, inhibitor of CSE. Western blot analysis revealed a marked reduction in CBS and CSE expression as well as H2S production in homogenates of mesenteric arterial bed and carotid artery from DEX-treated rats. In parallel, H2S plasma levels were significantly reduced in DEX group compared with vehicle. In conclusion, an impairment in EDHF/H2S signaling occurs in earlier state of GC-induced hypertension in rats suggesting that counteracting this dysfunction may be beneficial to manage DEX-associated increase in blood pressure.

Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are positively correlated with cardiovascular mortality in diabetes. However, the joint effect of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and hyperglycemia (HG) on endothelial dysfunction (ED) and the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. Mild (22 µmol/L) and moderate (88 µmol/L) HHcy were induced in cystathionine ß-synthase wild-type (Cbs(+/+)) and heterozygous-deficient (Cbs(-/+)) mice by a high-methionine (HM) diet. HG was induced by consecutive injection of streptozotocin. We found that HG worsened HHcy and elevated Hcy levels to 53 and 173 µmol/L in Cbs(+/+) and Cbs(-/+) mice fed an HM diet, respectively. Both mild and moderate HHcy aggravated HG-impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation to acetylcholine, which was completely abolished by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. HHcy potentiated HG-induced calpain activation in aortic endothelial cells isolated from Cbs mice. Calpain inhibitors rescued HHcy- and HHcy/HG-induced ED in vivo and ex vivo. Moderate HHcy- and HG-induced µ-calpain activation was potentiated by a combination of HHcy and HG in the mouse aorta. µ-Calpain small interfering RNA (µ-calpsiRNA) prevented HHcy/HG-induced ED in the mouse aorta and calpain activation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with DL-Hcy (500 µmol/L) and d-glucose (25 mmol) for 48 h. In addition, HHcy accelerated HG-induced superoxide production as determined by dihydroethidium and 3-nitrotyrosin staining and urinary 8-isoprostane/creatinine assay. Antioxidants rescued HHcy/HG-induced ED in mouse aortas and calpain activation in cultured HAECs. Finally, HHcy potentiated HG-suppressed nitric oxide production and eNOS activity in HAECs, which were prevented by calpain inhibitors or µ-calpsiRNA. HHcy aggravated HG-increased phosphorylation of eNOS at threonine 497/495 (eNOS-pThr497/495) in the mouse aorta and HAECs. HHcy/HG-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 was reversed by µ-calpsiRNA and adenoviral transduced dominant negative protein kinase C (PKC)ß2 in HAECs. HHcy and HG induced ED, which was potentiated by the combination of HHcy and HG via µ-calpain/PKCß2 activation-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 and eNOS inactivation.

High level of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia, HHcy) is associated with increased risk for vascular disease. Evidence for this emerges from epidemiological studies which show that HHcy is associated with premature peripheral, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease independent of other risk factors. Possible mechanisms by which homocysteine causes vascular injury include endothelial injury, DNA dysfunction, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, increased oxidative stress, reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase and promoting inflammation. HHcy has been shown to cause direct damage to endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, this manifests as impaired flow-mediated vasodilation and is mainly due to a reduction in nitric oxide synthesis and bioavailability. The effect of impaired nitric oxide release can in turn trigger and potentiate atherothrombogenesis and oxidative stress. Endothelial damage is a crucial aspect of atherosclerosis and precedes overt manifestation of disease. In addition, endothelial dysfunction is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, ischemia reperfusion injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Homocysteine is a precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is formed by transulfuration process catalyzed by the enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. H2S is a gasotransmitter that has emerged recently as a novel mediator in cardiovascular homeostasis. As a potent vasodilator, it plays several roles which include regulation of vessel diameter, protection of endothelium from redox stress, ischemia reperfusion injury and chronic inflammation. However, the precise mechanism by which it mediates these beneficial effects is complex and still remains unclear. Current evidence indicates H2S modulates cellular functions by a variety of intracellular signaling processes. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of HHcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and the metabolism and physiological functions of H2S as a protective agent.

Increased blood level of homocysteine (Hcy), called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) accompanies many cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that HHcy-enhanced cerebrovascular permeability occurs via activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and leads to an increased formation of fibrinogen-ß-amyloid (Fg-Aß) complex. Cerebrovascular permeability changes were assessed in C57BL/6J (wild type, WT), cystathionine-ß-synthase heterozygote (Cbs+/-, a genetic model of HHcy), MMP9 gene knockout (Mmp9-/-), and Cbs and Mmp9 double knockout (Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/-) mice using a dual-tracer probing method. Expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and Fg-Aß complex formation was assessed in mouse brain cryosections by immunohistochemistry. Short-term memory of mice was assessed with a novel object recognition test. The cerebrovascular permeability in Cbs+/- mice was increased via mainly the paracellular transport pathway. VE-cadherin expression was the lowest and Fg-Aß complex formation was the highest along with the diminished short-term memory in Cbs+/- mice. These effects of HHcy were ameliorated in Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/- mice. Thus, HHcy causes activation of MMP9 increasing cerebrovascular permeability by downregulation of VE-cadherin resulting in an enhanced formation of Fg-Aß complex that can be associated with loss of memory. These data may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention that can modulate HHcy-induced cerebrovascular permeability and resultant pathologies.

Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is maintained by the cross-talk of endothelial cells, junction proteins, and neurogliovascular network, the epigenetic mechanisms behind BBB permeability are largely unknown. We are reporting for the first time miR29b-mediated regulation of BBB, which is a novel mechanism underlying BBB integrity. We hypothesize that miR29b regulates BBB dysfunction by regulating DNMT3b, which consequently regulates the levels of metalloproteinases, that can eat up the membrane and junction proteins leading to leaky vasculature. In addition, 5'-azacytidine (5'-aza) was used to test its efficacy on BBB permeability. Blood-brain barrier disruption model was created by using homocysteine, and in the models miR29b was identified to be most affected, by using microRNA RT(2)-qPCR array. MiR29b mimics and inhibitors also confirmed that miR29b regulates the levels DNMT3b and MMP9. In hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine-ß-synthase deficient (CBS(+/-)) mice with high brain vessel permeability, miR29b levels were also high as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, 5'-aza improved BBB permeability by decreasing the expression of miR29b. In conclusion, our data suggested miR29b-mediated regulation of BBB dysfunction through DNMT3b and MMP9. It also potentiates the use of microRNAs as candidates for future epigenetic therapies in the improvement of BBB integrity.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is prevalent in patients with hypertension and is an independent risk factor for aortic pathologies. HHcy is known to cause an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), leading to the accumulation of collagen in the aorta and resulting in stiffness and development of hypertension. Although the exact mechanism of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is unclear, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic regulation involving DNA methylation. Our purpose was to investigate whether 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) inhibitor, reduces high blood pressure (BP) by regulating aortic ECM remodeling in HHcy. Wild-type and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)(+/-) HHcy mice were treated with Aza (0.5 mg/kg body weight). In HHcy mice, Aza treatment normalized the plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and BP. Thoracic and abdominal aorta ultrasound revealed a reduction in the resistive index and wall-to-lumen ratio. Vascular response to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside improved after Aza in HHcy mice. Histology showed a marked reduction in collagen deposition in the aorta. Aza treatment decreased the expression of DNMT1, MMP9, TIMP1, and S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and upregulated methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). We conclude that reduction of DNA methylation by Aza in HHcy reduces adverse aortic remodeling to mitigate hypertension.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with elderly frailty, skeletal muscle injury and malfunction, reduced vascular integrity and function, and mortality. Although HHcy has been implicated in the impairment of angiogenesis after hindlimb ischemia in murine models, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We hypothesized that HHcy compromises skeletal muscle perfusion, collateral formation, and arteriogenesis by diminishing postischemic vasculogenic responses in muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we created femoral artery ligation in wild-type and heterozygous cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS(+/-)) mice (a model for HHcy) and assessed tissue perfusion, collateral vessel formation, and skeletal muscle function using laser-Doppler perfusion imaging, barium angiography, and fatigue tests. In addition, we assessed postischemic levels of VEGF and levels of its muscle-specific regulators: hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator (PGC)-1a. The observations indicated dysregulation of VEGF, HIF-1a, and PGC-1a levels in ischemic skeletal muscles of CBS(+/-) mice. Concomitant with the reduced ischemic angiogenic responses, we also observed diminished leptin expression and attenuated Akt signaling in ischemic muscle fibers of CBS(+/-) mice. Moreover, there was enhanced atrogene, ubiquitin ligases that conjugate proteins for degradation during muscle atrophy, transcription, and reduced muscle function after ischemia in CBS(+/-) mice. These results suggest that HHcy adversely affects muscle-specific ischemic responses and contributes to muscle frailty.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) in the corpus cavernosum of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.METHODS: This study included 10 male SHRs and 10 healthy male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls, all aged 12 weeks. We applied a series of electric stimuli to the major pelvic ganglions of the rats, observed changes in the ratio of intracavernosal to mean arterial blood pressure (ICP/MAP), measured the levels of serum testosterone (T) and endogenous H2S, and determined the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: No obvious difference was found in the serum T level between the two groups. Compared with the WKY rats, the SHRs showed significant reduction in the ICP/MAP ratio, the contents of plasma H2S ([21.92 +/- 2.75] micromol/L vs [10.49 +/- 1.35] micromol/L, P &lt; 0.05) and endogenous corpus cavernosal H2S ([87.67 +/- 2.12] nmol/mg prot vs [52.60 +/- 3.44] nmol/mg prot, P &lt; 0.05), the level of endogenous H2S synthesis ([4.35 +/- 0.32] nmol/mg per min vs [1.14 +/- 0.07] nmol/mg per min, P &lt; 0.05) and the expressions of CBS and CSE (P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that CSE and CBS were distributed mainly in the smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells of the corpus cavernosum. The ICP/MAP ratio was highly positively correlated with the expressions of CSE (r = 0.977, P &lt; 0.05) and CBS (r = 0.955, P &lt; 0.05) in the corpus cavernosal tissue.CONCLUSION: Hypertension inhibits endogenous H2S synthesis by suppressing the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum, which might be related with hypertension-induced reduction of erectile function.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and is enzymatically metabolized in mitochondria by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR). Recent studies have indicated that H2S is synthesized by CSE in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), and is responsible for the anticontractile effect of PVAT on adjacent vessels. The lipophilic statin atorvastatin increases PVAT-derived H2S by suppressing its mitochondrial oxidation; the effect that results from statin-induced depletion of ubiquinone. Experimental obesity induced by a highly palatable diet has a time-dependent effect on H2S in PVAT. Adipose tissue hypoxia suppresses H2S oxidation and increases its level in short-term obesity not associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, in long-term obesity, insulin resistance and (or) hyperinsulinemia result in the down-regulation of CSE and H2S deficiency, which is corrected by treatment with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist administered for 2 weeks increases H2S by impairing mitochondria biogenesis. This indicates that the rate of mitochondrial H2S oxidation plays an important role in the regulation of H2S level in PVAT. Up-regulation of H2S signaling in short-term obesity and (or) by elevated endocannabinoids may be a compensatory mechanism that maintains vascular tone, despite endothelial dysfunction.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies and correlate with severity of heart failure in cross-sectional surveys. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a selective homocysteine lowering intervention beneficially affects cardiac remodelling and cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) in a murine model of combined hypercholesterolemia and hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer strategy was evaluated in female C57BL/6 low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)<U+207B>/<U+207B> cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs)<U+207A>/<U+207B> deficient mice fed a hyperhomocysteinemic and high saturated fat/high cholesterol diet using an E1E3E4-deleted hepatocyte-specific adenoviral vector expressing Cbs (AdCBS). MI was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery 14 days after saline injection or gene transfer. AdCBS gene transfer resulted in a persistent more than 5-fold (p&lt;0.01) decrease of plasma homocysteine levels and significantly improved endothelial progenitor cell function. Selective homocysteine lowering enhanced infarct healing as indicated by a 21% (p&lt;0.01) reduction of infarct length at day 28 after MI and by an increased number of capillaries and increased collagen content in the infarct zone. Adverse remodelling was attenuated in AdCBS MI mice as evidenced by a 29% (p&lt;0.05) reduction of left ventricular cavity area at day 28, by an increased capillary density in the remote myocardium, and by reduced interstitial collagen. The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 19% (p&lt;0.05) and the time constant of left ventricular relaxation was reduced by 21% (p&lt;0.05) in AdCBS MI mice compared to control MI mice, indicating improved diastolic function.SIGNIFICANCE: Selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer improves infarct healing, attenuates remodelling, and significantly enhances diastolic function post-MI in female C57BL/6 Ldlr<U+207B>/<U+207B> Cbs<U+207A>/<U+207B> mice. The current study corroborates the view that hyperhomocysteinemia exerts direct effects on the myocardium and may potentiate the development of heart failure.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, characterized by high plasma homocysteine levels, is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The increased synthesis of homocysteine, a product of methionine metabolism involving B vitamins, and its slower intracellular utilization cause increased flux into the blood. Plasma homocysteine level is an important reflection of hepatic methionine metabolism and the rate of processes modified by B vitamins as well as different enzyme activity. Lowering homocysteine might offer therapeutic benefits. However, approximately 50% of hyperhomocysteinemic patients due to cystathionine-beta-synthase deficiency are biochemically responsive to pharmacological doses of B vitamins. Therefore, effective treatments to reduce homocysteine levels are needed, and gene therapy could provide a novel approach. We recently showed that hepatic expression of DYRK1A, a serine/threonine kinase, is negatively correlated with plasma homocysteine levels in cystathionine-beta-synthase deficient mice, a mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Therefore, Dyrk1a is a good candidate for gene therapy to normalize homocysteine levels. We then used an adenoviral construct designed to restrict expression of DYRK1A to hepatocytes, and found decreased plasma homocysteine levels after hepatocyte-specific Dyrk1a gene transfer in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. The elevation of pyridoxal phosphate was consistent with the increase in cystathionine-beta-synthase activity. Commensurate with the decreased plasma homocysteine levels, targeted hepatic expression of DYRK1A resulted in elevated plasma paraoxonase-1 activity and apolipoprotein A-I levels, and rescued the Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways in aorta of mice, which can prevent homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction. These results demonstrate that hepatocyte-restricted Dyrk1a gene transfer can offer a useful therapeutic targets for the development of new selective homocysteine lowering therapy.

PURPOSE: Mice with moderate/severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency or absence of the cbs gene encoding cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) have marked retinal disruption, ganglion cell loss, optic nerve mitochondrial dysfunction, and ERG defects; those with mild hyperhomocysteinemia have delayed retinal morphological/functional phenotype. Excess homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases; however, it is not known whether excess homocysteine alters retinal vasculature.METHODS: Cbs(+/+), cbs(+/-), and cbs(-/-) mice (age ~3 weeks) were subjected to angiography; retinas were harvested for cryosections, flat-mount preparations, or trypsin digestion and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize vessels using isolectin-B4, to detect angiogenesis using anti-VEGF and anti-endoglin (anti-CD105) and activated glial cells (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein [anti-GFAP]) and to investigate the blood-retinal barrier using the tight junction markers zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Expression of vegf was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were treated with excess homocysteine to analyze permeability.RESULTS: Angiography revealed vascular leakage in cbs(-/-) mice; immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated vascular patterns consistent with ischemia; isolectin-B4 labeling revealed a capillary-free zone centrally and new vessels with capillary tufts midperipherally. This was associated with increased vegf mRNA and protein, CD105, and GFAP in cbs(-/-) retinas concomitant with a marked decrease in ZO-1 and occludin. Homocysteine-treated HRECs showed increased permeability.CONCLUSIONS: Severe elevation of homocysteine in cbs(-/-) mutant mice is accompanied by alterations in retinal vasculature (ischemia, neovascularization, and incompetent blood-retinal barrier). The marked disruption of retinal structure and decreased visual function reported in cbs(-/-) mice may reflect vasculopathy as well as neuropathy.

Availability of methionine is known to modulate the rate of aging in model organisms, best illustrated by the observation that dietary methionine restriction extends the lifespan of rodents. However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In eukaryotic cells, methionine can be converted to cysteine through the reverse transsulfuration pathway thereby modulating intracellular methionine availability. Whereas previous results obtained in yeast and fruit flies suggest that alterations in the reverse transsulfuration pathway modulate the rate of aging, it is not known whether this function is conserved in evolution. Here we show that depletion of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), a rate limiting enzyme in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, induces premature senescence in human endothelial cells. We found that CBS depletion induces mild mitochondrial dysfunction and increases the sensitivity of endothelial cells to homocysteine, a known inducer of endothelial cell senescence and an established risk factor for vascular disease. Our finding that CBS deficiency induces endothelial cell senescencein vitro, involving both mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility of the cells to homocysteine, suggests a new mechanism linking CBS deficiency to vascular aging and disease.

Hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S) is emerging as an important endogenous modulator, which exhibits the beneficial effects of nitric oxide (NO) on the cardiovascular (CV) system, without producing toxic metabolites. H(2)S is biosynthesized in mammalian tissues by cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase. H(2)S exhibits the antioxidant properties of inorganic and organic sulphites, behaving as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. There is also clear evidence that H(2)S triggers other important effects, mainly mediated by the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)). This mechanism accounts for the vasorelaxing and cardioprotective effects of H(2)S. Furthermore, H(2)S inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and platelet aggregation. In non-CV systems, H(2)S regulates the functions of the central nervous system, as well as respiratory, gastroenteric, and endocrine systems. Conversely, H(2)S deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Likewise, impairment of H(2)S biosynthesis is involved in CV complications associated with diabetes mellitus. There is also evidence of a cross-talk between the H(2)S and the endothelial NO pathways. In particular, recent observations indicate a possible pathogenic link between deficiencies of H(2 S activity and the progress of endothelial dysfunction. These biological aspects of endogenous H(2)S have led several authors to look at this mediator as &quot;the new NO&quot; that has given attractive opportunities to develop innovative classes of drugs. In this review, the main biological actions of H(2)S are discussed. Moreover, some examples of H(2)S-donors are shown, as well as some hybrids, in which H(2)S-releasing moieties are added to well-known drugs, for improving their pharmacodynamic profile or reducing the potential for adverse effects, are reported.

PURPOSE: Hyperhomocysteinemia is well recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of premature atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, however, may be prevented by polyphenols, potent antioxidant compounds with anti-atherogenic properties. Previously, we used cystathionine beta synthase-deficient mice [Cbs (±)] fed a high-methionine diet-a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia-to show that daily intake of a red wine polyphenolic extract, mainly comprised of catechin and epicatechin, has a beneficial effect on aortic expression of endothelial dysfunction biomarkers and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of the present study was to understand whether catechin and epicatechin, in purified forms, have anti-atherogenic effects in hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODS: Cbs (±) mice received 50 µg of catechin and/or epicatechin daily in drinking water for 1 month. Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and aortic expression of several endothelial dysfunction biomarkers (Vcam-1, Icam-1, E-selectin, and Lox-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf-a, Il-6) were assessed.RESULTS: We found that both catechin and epicatechin had a beneficial effect on plasma homocysteine levels and endothelial dysfunction biomarker expression; however, only catechin had a beneficial effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Further, when both polyphenols were given, a beneficial effect was observed only on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.CONCLUSIONS: Catechin seems to be a more potent anti-atherogenic compound than epicatechin in hyperhomocysteinemia and should be considered as a novel therapeutic approach against endothelial dysfunction induced by this condition.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been found to play beneficial roles in ameliorating several diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiac/renal ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), the main enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway, catalyze H(2)S production in mammalian tissues. However, the distributions and precise roles of these enzymes in the kidney have not yet been identified.METHODS: The present study examined the localization of both enzymes in the normal kidney and the effect of the H(2)S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) in the renal peritubular capillary (PTC) under conditions of diabetic nephropathy, using pancreatic ß-cell-specific calmodulin-overexpressing transgenic mice as a model of diabetes.RESULTS: In the normal kidney, we detected expression of both CBS and CSE in the brush border and cytoplasm of the proximal tubules, but not in the glomeruli, distal tubules and vascular endothelial cells of renal PTCs. Administration of NaHS increased PTC diameter and blood flow. We further evaluated whether biosynthesis of H(2)S was altered in a spontaneous diabetic model that developed renal lesions similar to human diabetic nephropathy. CSE expression was markedly reduced under diabetic conditions, whereas CBS expression was unaffected. Progressive diabetic nephropathy showed vasoconstriction and a loss of blood flow in PTCs that was ameliorated by NaHS treatment.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CSE expression in the proximal tubules may also regulate tubulointerstitial microcirculation via H(2)S production. H(2)S may represent a target of treatment to prevent progression of ischemic injury in diabetic nephropathy.

Hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S) is now viewed as an important endogenous gasotransmitter, which exhibits many beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. H(2)S is biosynthesized in mammalian tissues by both non-enzymatic processes and several enzymatic pathways ensured by cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase. H(2)S is endowed with the antioxidant properties of inorganic and organic sulphites, being a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, H(2)S triggers other important effects and the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) accounts for its vasorelaxing and cardioprotective effects. H(2)S also inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and platelet aggregation. Conversely, the impairment of H(2)S contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension and is involved in cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus. There is also evidence of a link between H(2)S and endothelial nitric oxide (NO). Recent observations indicate a possible pathogenic link between deficiencies of H(2)S activity and the progress of endothelial dysfunction. These biological aspects of endogenous H(2)S led to consider this mediator as &quot;the new NO&quot; and to evaluate new attractive opportunities to develop innovative classes of drugs. In this review, the main roles played by H(2)S in the cardiovascular system and the first examples of H(2)S-donor drugs are discussed. Some hybrid drugs are also addressed in this review. In such compounds opportune H(2)S-releasing moieties are conjugated to well-known drugs to improve their pharmacodynamic profile or to reduce the potential for adverse effects.



#### Increased endogenous H2S generation by CBS, CSE, and 3MST gene therapy improves ex vivo renovascular relaxation in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been identified as a regulator of various physiological events, including vasodilation, angiogenesis, antiapoptotic, and cellular signaling. Endogenously, H(2)S is produced as a metabolite of homocysteine (Hcy) by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). Although Hcy is recognized as vascular risk factor at an elevated level [hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)] and contributes to vascular injury leading to renovascular dysfunction, the exact mechanism is unclear. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether conversion of Hcy to H(2)S improves renovascular function. Ex vivo renal artery culture with CBS, CSE, and 3MST triple gene therapy generated more H(2)S in the presence of Hcy, and these arteries were more responsive to endothelial-dependent vasodilation compared with nontransfected arteries treated with high Hcy. Cross section of triple gene-delivered renal arteries immunostaining suggested increased expression of CD31 and VEGF and diminished expression of the antiangiogenic factor endostatin. In vitro endothelial cell culture demonstrated increased mitophagy during high levels of Hcy and was mitigated by triple gene delivery. Also, dephosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated FoxO3 in HHcy were reversed by H(2)S or triple gene delivery. Upregulated matrix metalloproteinases-13 and downregulated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in HHcy were normalized by overexpression of triple genes. Together, these results suggest that H(2)S plays a key role in renovasculopathy during HHcy and is mediated through Akt/FoxO3 pathways. We conclude that conversion of Hcy to H(2)S by CBS, CSE, or 3MST triple gene therapy improves renovascular function in HHcy.

In hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction due to reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide is a consistent finding. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Increased levels of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) have been associated with HHcy, and may contribute, at least in part, for the homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction, but whether cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is associated with increased ADMA has hardly been investigated. To address this question, we measured total homocysteine (tHcy), ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in plasma of 22 adult CBS deficient patients, using established HPLC techniques. Results showed that in CBS deficient patients with elevated levels of tHcy (median (total range): 33 (14-237) µmol/L), both ADMA and SDMA levels were normal. Moreover, tHcy and ADMA concentrations were not correlated (r(s)=0.017, p=0.94). Our results favor the hypothesis that the negative vascular effects of HHcy have an ADMA-independent etiology.

Though the existence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in biological tissues has been known for over 300 years, it is the most recently appreciated of the gasotransmitters as a physiologic messenger molecule. The enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) had long been speculated to generate H2S, and inhibitors of these enzymes had been employed to characterize influences of H2S in various organs. Definitive evidence that H2S is a physiologic regulator came with the development of mice with targeted deletion of CSE and CBS. Best characterized is the role of H2S, formed by CSE, as an endothelial derived relaxing factor that normally regulates blood pressure by acting through ATP-sensitive potassium channels. H2S participates in various phases of the inflammatory process, predominantly exerting anti-inflammatory actions. Currently, the most advanced efforts to develop therapeutic agents involve the combination of H2S donors with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The H2S releasing moiety provides cytoprotection to gastric mucosa normally adversely affected by NSAIDs while the combination of H2S and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may afford synergistic anti-inflammatory influences.

Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While Hcy has been shown to promote endothelial dysfunction by decreasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide and increasing oxidative stress in the vasculature, the effects of Hcy on cardiomyocytes remain less understood. In this study we explored the effects of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) on myocardial function ex vivo and examined the direct effects of Hcy on cardiomyocyte function and survival in vitro. Studies with isolated hearts from wild type and HHcy mice (heterozygous cystathionine-beta synthase deficient mice) demonstrated that HHcy mouse hearts had more severely impaired cardiac relaxation and contractile function and increased cell death following ischemia reperfusion (I/R). In isolated cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes, exposure to Hcy for 24 h impaired cardiomyocyte contractility in a concentration-dependent manner, and promoted apoptosis as revealed by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling and cleaved caspase-3 immunoblotting. These effects were associated with activation of p38 MAPK, decreased expression of thioredoxin (TRX) protein, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of p38 MAPK by the selective inhibitor SB203580 (5 µM) prevented all of these Hcy-induced changes. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TRX in cardiomyocytes significantly attenuated Hcy-induced ROS generation, apoptosis, and impairment of myocyte contractility. Thus, Hcy may increase the risk for CVD not only by causing endothelial dysfunction, but also by directly exerting detrimental effects on cardiomyocytes.

More than 29 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with hearing loss. Interestingly, elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), are also associated with impaired hearing. However, the associated mechanism remains obscure. The collagen receptor such as discoidin domain receptor 1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) play a significant role in inner ear structure and function. We hypothesize that HHcy increases hearing thresholds by compromise in inner ear vasculature resulted from impaired Hcy metabolism, increased oxidative stress, collagen IVa and collagen Ia turnover. The treatment with folic acid (FA) protects elevated hearing thresholds and prevents reduction in vessel density by lowering abundant collagen deposition and oxidative stress in inner ear. To test this hypothesis we employed 8 weeks old male wild type (WT), cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice, WT + FA (0.0057 µg/g/day, equivalent to a 400 µg/70 kg/day human dose in drinking water); and CBS(+/-) +FA. The mice were treated for four weeks. The hearing thresholds were determined by recording the auditory brainstem responses. Integrity of vessels was analyzed by perfusion of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracer. Endothelial permeability was assessed, which indicated restoration of HRP leakage by FA treatment. A total Hcy level was increased in stria vascularis (SV) and spiral ligament (SL) of CBS+/- mice which was lowered by FA. Interestingly, FA treatment lowered Col IVa Immunostaining by affecting its turnover. The levels of MMP-2, -9, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathione gamma lyase (CSE) were measured by Western blot analysis. The oxidative stress was high in SV and SL of CBS+/- compared to WT however the treatment with FA lowered oxidative stress in CBS+/- mice. These data suggested that hearing loss in CBS+/- mice was primarily due to leakage in inner ear circulation, also partly by induced collagen imbalance, increase in Hcy and oxidative stress in inner ear.

Hyperhomocysteinemia confers a high risk for thrombotic vascular events, but homocysteine-lowering therapies have been ineffective in reducing the incidence of secondary vascular outcomes, raising questions regarding the role of homocysteine as a mediator of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, to determine the contribution of elevated homocysteine to thrombosis susceptibility, we studied Cbs(-/-) mice conditionally expressing a zinc-inducible mutated human CBS (I278T) transgene. Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice exhibited severe hyperhomocysteinemia and endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arterioles. Surprisingly, however, these mice did not display increased susceptibility to arterial or venous thrombosis as measured by photochemical injury in the carotid artery, chemical injury in the carotid artery or mesenteric arterioles, or ligation of the inferior vena cava. A survey of hemostatic and hemodynamic parameters revealed no detectible differences between control and Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice. Our data demonstrate that severe elevation in homocysteine leads to the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction but is not sufficient to promote thrombosis. These findings may provide insights into the failure of homocysteine-lowering trials in secondary prevention from thrombotic vascular events.

Hyperhomocysteinemia was first associated with degenerative disease by observation of accelerated arteriosclerosis in children with inherited disorders of cystathionine synthase, methionine synthase, and methylene tetrohydrofolate reductase. The metabolic blockade of sulfate synthesis from homocysteine thiolactone in malignant cells is ascribed to a deficiency of a chemopreventive derivative of homocysteine thiolactone that occurs in normal cells. Its chemical structure was elucidated by the organic synthesis of thioretinamide from retinoic acid and homocysteine thiolactone. Oxidation of the sulfur atom of homocysteine is inhibited in scorbutic guinea pigs, demonstrating ascorbate function in sulfate synthesis from homocysteine. Studies of homocysteine metabolism in protein energy malnutrition led to the conclusion that the biosynthesis of thioretinamide from the retinol of transthyretin is catalyzed by dehydroascorbate and superoxide generated from the heme oxygenase group of cystathionine synthase. Newly synthesized thioretinamide is complexed with cobalamin to form thioretinaco, which is activated by ozone and oxygen to function as the active site of oxidative phosphorylation. In accordance with the trophoblastic theory of cancer, pancreatic enzymes are believed to be oncolytic because they hydrolyze the homocysteinylated proteins, nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans of malignant tissues. The clonal selection of malignant cells that are deficient in the heme oxygenase function of cystathionine synthase produces cells dependent upon glycolysis for ATP synthesis, since they are deficient in synthesis of thioretinamide, thioretinaco and thioretinaco ozonide. The vulnerable plaque of arteriosclerosis originates from complexes of microbes with homocysteinylated lipoproteins, obstructing vasa vasorum narrowed by endothelial dysfunction, causing arterial ischemia, and intimal micro-abscesses. Degenerative diseases may be ameliorated by a proposed therapeutic protocol of thioretinamide with pancreatic enzymes.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) was the third gaseous transmitter to be discovered, along with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and has been proposed to be involved in numerous physiological processes and pathology of various diseases. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is characterized by multiple key events including endothelial dysfunction, monocyte infiltration and their differentiation into macrophages, conversion of lesion-resident macrophages into foam cells, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has indicated that H(2)S plays a potentially significant role in all of these biological processes and that malfunction of H(2)S homeostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Experiments have demonstrated that H(2)S supplementation ameliorated many of these atherogenic processes and hence, such supplementation potentially may prove to be of therapeutic benefit in the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis. H(2)S levels may be induced by the administration of H(2)S or H(2)S donors, or alternatively be reduced by the administration of specific cystathionine ß-synthase or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase inhibitors. However, issues remain with the potential use of currently available H(2)S-modulating agents in a clinical setting. This review will provide a description of the current literature on the involvement of H(2)S in these key aspects of vascular biology that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, as well as the therapeutic potential of currently available H(2)S-modulating agents.

Human atherosclerotic coronary vessels elicited vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (Ach) and revealed a phenomenon of vasospasm. Homocysteine (Hcy) levels are elevated in the atherosclerotic plaque tissue, suggesting its pathological role in endothelial damage in atherosclerotic diseases. Accordingly, we examined the role hyperhomocysteinemia in coronary endothelial dysfunction, vessel wall thickness, lumen narrowing, leading to acute/chronic coronary vasospasm. The therapeutic potential and mechanisms of folic acid (FA) using hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine beta synthase heterozygote (CBS-/+) and wild type (CBS+/+) mice were addressed. The CBS-/+ and CBS+/+ mice were treated with or without a Hcy lowering agent FA in drinking water (0.03 g/L) for 4 weeks. The isolated mouse septum coronary artery was cannulated and pressurized at 60 mmHg. The wall thickness and lumen diameters were measured by Ion-Optic. The vessels were treated with Ach (10(-8) -10(-5) <U+2009>M) and, for comparison, with non-endothelial vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (10(-5) <U+2009>M). The endothelium-impaired arteries from CBC-/+ mice constricted in response to Ach and this vasoconstriction was mitigated with FA supplementation. The level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was lower in coronary artery in CBS-/+ than of CBS+/+ mice. Treatment with FA increased the levels of Ach-induced NO generation in the coronary artery of CBS-/+ mice. The results suggest that Ach induced coronary vasoconstriction in CBS-/+ mice and this vasoconstriction was ameliorated by FA treatment. The mechanisms for the impairment of vascular function and therapeutic effects of FA may be related to the regulation of eNOS expression, NO availability and tissue homocysteine.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for ischemic cardiovascular diseases, but its causal role in atherothrombosis remains controversial. Proatherogenic and/or prothrombotic effects may underlie the potential causal relation between hyperhomocysteinemia and cardiovascular events. Here, the effects of selective lowering of plasma homocysteine, plasma cholesterol, or both on endothelial function and on atherogenesis in male hyperlipidemic and hyperhomocysteinemic C57BL/6 low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr)(-/-)/cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS)(+/-)-deficient mice were investigated. Second, we evaluated whether selective homocysteine lowering has anti-thrombotic effects in a model of arterial thrombosis. A hyperhomocysteinemic and atherogenic diet was started at the age of 12 weeks. Three weeks later, gene transfer was performed with E1E3E4-deleted adenoviral vectors for hepatocyte-restricted overexpression of CBS (AdCBS) or of the LDLr (AdLDLr), or with the control vector Adnull. In a fourth group, AdCBS and AdLDLr were co-administered. Selective homocysteine lowering but not selective cholesterol lowering restored endothelial function at 6 weeks after gene transfer. Intimal area in the aortic root and in the brachiocephalic artery at 13 weeks was more than 100-fold (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) smaller in AdLDLr and AdCBS/AdLDLr mice than in control mice and AdCBS mice. No differences in intimal area were observed between control mice and AdCBS mice. In a model of carotid artery thrombosis, the average time to first occlusion and to stable occlusion were 1.9-fold (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and 2.1-fold longer (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), respectively, in AdCBS-treated mice than in control mice. Taken together, these data show that correction of endothelial dysfunction following selective homocysteine lowering has anti-thrombotic but no anti-atherogenic effects.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with endothelial dysfunction (ED), but the mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of HHcy-induced ED in microvasculature in our newly established mouse model of severe HHcy (plasma total homocysteine, 169.5 µM). We found that severe HHcy impaired nitric oxide (NO)- and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated, endothelium-dependent relaxations of small mesenteric arteries (SMAs). Endothelium-independent and prostacyclin-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations were not changed. A nonselective Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel (K(Ca)) inhibitor completely blocked EDHF-mediated relaxation. Selective blockers for small-conductance K(Ca) (SK) or intermediate-conductance K(Ca) (IK) failed to inhibit EDHF-mediated relaxation in HHcy mice. HHcy increased the levels of SK3 and IK1 protein, superoxide (O(2)(-)), and 3-nitrotyrosine in the endothelium of SMAs. Preincubation with antioxidants and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) inhibitors improved endothelium-dependent and EDHF-mediated relaxations and decreased O(2)(-) production in SMAs from HHcy mice. Further, EDHF-mediated relaxation was inhibited by ONOO(-) and prevented by catalase in the control mice. Finally, L-homocysteine stimulated O(2)(-) production, which was reversed by antioxidants, and increased SK/IK protein levels and tyrosine nitration in cultured human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that HHcy impairs EDHF relaxation in SMAs by inhibiting SK/IK activities via oxidation- and tyrosine nitration-related mechanisms.

In hypertension, an increase in arterial wall thickness and loss of elasticity over time result in an increase in pulse wave velocity, a direct measure of arterial stiffness. This change is reflected in gradual fragmentation and loss of elastin fibers and accumulation of stiffer collagen fibers in the media that occurs independently of atherosclerosis. Similar results are seen with an elevated level of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), which increases vascular thickness, elastin fragmentation, and arterial blood pressure. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated a decrease in elasticity and an increase in pulse wave velocity in HHcy cystathionine ß synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS(-/+)) mice. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in MMP-NO-TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) inhibitory tertiary complex. We have demonstrated the contribution of the NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, in the activation of latent MMP. The differential production of NO contributes to oxidative stress and increased oxidative/nitrative activation of MMP resulting in vascular remodeling in response to HHcy. The contribution of the NOS isoforms, endothelial and inducible in the collagen/elastin switch, has been demonstrated. We have showed that an increase in inducible NOS activity is a key contributor to HHcy-mediated collagen/elastin switch and resulting decline in aortic compliance. In addition, increased levels of Hcy compete and suppress the <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid-receptor, N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. The HHcy causes oxidative stress by generating nitrotyrosine, activating the latent MMPs and decreasing the endothelial NO concentration. The HHcy causes elastinolysis and decrease elastic complicance of the vessel wall. The treatment with <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid-receptor agonist (muscimol), N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist (MK-801), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (ciprofibrate and ciglitazone) mitigates the cardiovascular dysfunction in HHcy [corrected].

Remodeling by its very nature implies synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components (such as elastin, collagen, and connexins). Most of the vascular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are latent because of the presence of constitutive nitric oxide (NO). However, during oxidative stress peroxinitrite (ONOO-) activates the latent MMPs and instigates vascular remodeling. Interestingly, in mesenteric artery, homocysteine (Hcy) decreases the NO bio-availability, and folic acid (FA, an Hcy-lowering agent) mitigates the Hcy-mediated mesentery artery dysfunction. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 (DDAH-2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) increases NO production. The hypothesis was that the Hcy decreased NO bio-availability, in part, activating MMP, decreasing elastin, DDAH-2, eNOS and increased vasomotor response by increasing connexin. To test this hypothesis,the authors used 12-week-old C57BJ/L6 wild type (WT) and hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy)-cystathione beta synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice. Blood pressure measurements were made by radio-telemetry. WT and MMP-9 knockout mice were administered with Hcy (0.67 mg/ml in drinking water). Superior mesenteric artery and mesenteric arcade were analyzed with light and confocal microscopy. The protein expressions were measured by western blot analysis. The mRNA levels for MMP-9 were measured by RT-PCR. The data showed decreased DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions in mesentery in CBS-/+ mice compared with WT mice. Immuno-fluorescence and western blot results suggest increased MMP-9 and connexin-40 expression in mesenteric arcades of CBS-/+ mice compared with WT mice. The wall thickness of third-order mesenteric artery was increased in CBS-/+ mice compared to WT mice. Hcy treatment increased blood pressure in WT mice. Interestingly, in MMP-9 KO, Hcy did not increase blood pressure. These results may suggest that HHcy causes mesenteric artery remodeling and narrowing by activating MMP-9 and decreasing DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions, compromising the blood flow, instigating hypertension, and acute abdomen pain.

BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and hyperglycemia cause diabetic cardiomyopathy by inducing oxidative stress and attenuating peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. However, their synergistic contribution is not clear.METHODS: Diabetic Akita (Ins2+/-) and hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine beta synthase mutant (CBS+/-) were used for M-mode echocardiography at the age of four and twenty four weeks. The cardiac rings from WT, Akita and hybrid (Ins2+/-/CBS+/-) of Akita and CBS+/- were treated with different doses of acetylcholine (an endothelial dependent vasodilator). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed for determining plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level in the above groups. Akita was treated with ciglitazone (CZ) - a PPAR gamma agonist and tempol-an anti-oxidant, separately and their effects on cardiac remodeling were assessed.RESULTS: At twenty four week, Akita mice were hyperglycemic and HHcy. They have increased end diastolic diameter (EDD). In their heart PPAR gamma, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-4 (TIMP-4) and anti-oxidant thioredoxin were attenuated whereas matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, TIMP-3 and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) were induced. Interestingly, they showed synergism between HHcy and hyperglycemia for endothelial-myocyte (E-M) uncoupling. Additionally, treatment with CZ alleviated MMP-9 activity and fibrosis, and improved EDD. On the other hand, treatment with tempol reversed cardiac remodeling in part by restoring the expressions of TIMP-3,-4, thioredoxin and MMP-9.CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous homocysteine exacerbates diabetic cardiomyopathy by attenuating PPAR gamma and inducing E-M uncoupling leading to diastolic dysfunction. PPAR gamma agonist and tempol mitigates oxidative stress and ameliorates diastolic dysfunction in diabetes.

A decrease in vascular elasticity and an increase in pulse wave velocity in hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy) cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS(-/+)) mice has been observed. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in MMP-NO-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) inhibitory tertiary complex. However, the contribution of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms eNOS and iNOS in the activation of latent MMP is unclear. We hypothesize that the differential production of NO contributes to oxidative stress and increased oxidative/nitrative activation of MMP, resulting in vascular remodeling in response to HHcy. The overall goal is to elucidate the contribution of the NOS isoforms, endothelial and inducible, in the collagen/elastin switch. Experiments were performed on six groups of animals [wild-type (WT), eNOS(-/-), and iNOS(-/-) with and without homocysteine (Hcy) treatment (0.67 g/l) for 8-12 wk]. In vivo echograph was performed to assess aortic timed flow velocity for indirect compliance measurement. Histological determination of collagen and elastin with trichrome and van Gieson stains, respectively, was performed. In situ measurement of superoxide generation using dihydroethidium was used. Differential expression of eNOS, iNOS, nitrotyrosine, MMP-2 and -9, and elastin were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses. The 2% gelatin zymography was used to assess MMP activity. The increase in O(2)(-) and robust activity of MMP-9 in eNOS(-/-), WT+Hcy, and eNOS(-/-)+Hcy was accompanied by the gross disorganization and thickening of the ECM along with extensive collagen deposition and elastin degradation (collagen/elastin switch) resulting in a decrease in aortic timed flow velocity. Results show that an increase in iNOS activity is a key contributor to HHcy-mediated collagen/elastin switch and resulting decline in aortic compliance.

Increased levels of homocysteine (Hcy), recognized as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), were associated with cardiovascular diseases. There was controversy regarding the detrimental versus cardio protective role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in ischemic heart disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the Hcy generated nitrotyrosine by inducing the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, causing endothelial-myocyte (E-M) coupling. To differentiate the role of iNOS versus constitutive nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) in Hcy-mediated nitrotyrosine generation and matrix remodeling in cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular (LV) tissue was analyzed from cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) heterozygote knockout, iNOS homozygote knockout, CBS-/+/iNOS-/- double knockout, and wild-type (WT) mice. The levels of nitrotyrosine, MMP-2 and -9 (zymographic analysis), and fibrosis (by trichrome stain) were measured. The endothelial-myocyte function was determined in cardiac rings. In CBS-/+ mice, homocysteine was elevated and in iNOS-/- mice, nitric oxide was significantly reduced. The nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels were elevated in double knockout and CBS-/+ as compared to WT mice. Although MMP-2 levels were similar in CBS-/+, iNOS-/-, and CBS-/+/iNOS-/-, the levels were three- to fourfold higher than WT. The levels of collagen were similar in CBS-/+ and iNOS-/-, but they were threefold higher than WT. Interesting, the levels of collagen increased sixfold in double knockouts, compared to WT, suggesting synergism between high Hcy and lack of iNOS. Left ventricular hypertrophy was exaggerated in the iNOS-/- and double knockout, and mildly increased in the CBS-/+, compared to WT mice. The endothelial-dependent relaxation was attenuated to the same extent in the CBS-/+ and iNOS-/-, compared to WT, but it was robustly blunted in double knockouts. The results concluded that homocysteine generated nitrotyrosine in the vicinity of endothelium, caused MMP activation and endothelium-myocyte uncoupling. The generation of nitrotyrosine was independent of iNOS.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, or abnormally high plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration, has often been associated with vascular thrombosis and the development of premature atherosclerosis. Many studies have shown that moderate wine consumption has potential beneficial effects related to the prevention of atherosclerosis, in part attributed to the biological properties of polyphenolic components, mainly flavonoids. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of a red wine polyphenolic extract (PE) administration on hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency and on the associated biochemical markers of hepatic and endothelial dysfunctions in mice. Red wine PE was added for 4 weeks to the drinking water of heterozygous CBS-deficient mice fed a high-methionine diet, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Red wine PE supplementation at low dose significantly reduced plasma Hcy levels and restored the hepatic and plasma-decreased paraoxonase-1 activity induced by chronic hyperhomocysteinemia. Moreover, aortic expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules and levels of soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 were reduced in hyperhomocysteinemic mice fed the red wine PE supplementation. These findings suggest that red wine PE administration in low quantities has beneficial effects on biochemical markers of endothelial dysfunction due to hyperhomocysteinemia.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, has been proposed to be a mediator of vascular dysfunction during hyperhomocysteinemia. Levels of ADMA are regulated by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, we tested the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia causes downregulation of the two genes encoding DDAH (Ddah1 and Ddah2). In the MS-1 murine endothelial cell line, the addition of homocysteine decreased NO production but did not elevate ADMA or alter levels of Ddah1 or Ddah2 mRNA. Mice heterozygous for cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs) and their wild-type littermates were fed either a control diet or a high-methionine/low-folate (HM/LF) diet to produce varying degrees of hyperhomocysteinemia. Maximal relaxation of the carotid artery to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine was decreased by approximately 50% in Cbs(+/-) mice fed the HM/LF diet compared with Cbs(+/+) mice fed the control diet (P &lt; 0.001). Compared with control mice, hyperhomocysteinemic mice had lower levels of Ddah1 mRNA in the liver (P &lt; 0.001) and lower levels of Ddah2 mRNA in the liver, lung, and kidney (P &lt; 0.05). Downregulation of DDAH expression in hyperhomocysteinemic mice did not result in an increase in plasma ADMA, possibly due to a large decrease in hepatic methylation capacity (S-adenosylmethionine-to-S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio). Our findings demonstrate that hyperhomocysteinemia causes tissue-specific decreases in DDAH expression without altering plasma ADMA levels in mice with endothelial dysfunction.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for arterial as well as venous thromboembolism. Individuals with severe hyperhomocysteinemia caused by inherited genetic defects in homocysteine metabolism have an extremely high incidence of vascular thrombosis unless they are treated aggressively with homocysteine-lowering therapy. The clinical value of homocysteine-lowering therapy in individuals with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, which is very common in populations at risk for vascular disease, is more controversial. Considerable progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular thrombotic events has been provided by the development of a variety of murine models. Because levels of homocysteine are regulated by both the methionine and folate cycles, hyperhomocysteinemia can be induced in mice through both genetic and dietary manipulations. Mice deficient in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene have been exploited widely in many studies investigating the vascular pathophysiology of hyperhomocysteinemia. In this article, we review the established murine models, including the CBS-deficient mouse as well as several newer murine models available for the study of hyperhomocysteinemia. We also summarize the major vascular phenotypes observed in these murine models.

Cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice (Cbs(-/-)) exhibit several pathophysiological features similar to hyperhomocysteinemic patients, including endothelial dysfunction and hepatic steatosis. Heterozygous mutants (Cbs(+/-)) on the C57BL/6J background are extensively analyzed in laboratories worldwide; however, detailed analyses of Cbs(-/-) have been hampered by the fact that they rarely survive past the weaning age probably due to severe hepatic dysfunction. We backcrossed the mutants with four inbred strains (C57BL/6J(Jcl), BALB/cA, C3H/HeJ and DBA/2J) for seven generations, and compared Cbs(-/-) phenotypes among the different genetic backgrounds. Although Cbs(-/-) on all backgrounds were hyperhomocysteinemic/hypermethioninemic and suffered from lipidosis/hepatic steatosis at 2 weeks of age, &gt;30% of C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-) survived over 8 weeks whereas none of DBA/2J-Cbs(-/-) survived beyond 5 weeks. At 2 weeks, serum levels of total homocysteine and triglyceride were lowest in C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-). Adult C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-) survivors showed hyperhomocysteinemia but escaped hypermethioninemia, lipidosis and hepatic steatosis. They appeared normal in general behavioral tests but showed cerebellar malformation and impaired learning ability in the passive avoidance step-through test, and required sufficient dietary supplementation of cyst(e)ine for survival, demonstrating the essential roles of cystathionine beta-synthase in the central nervous system function and cysteine biosynthesis. Our C3H/HeJ-Cbs(-/-) mice could be useful tools for investigating clinical symptoms such as mental retardation and thromboembolism that are found in homocysteinemic patients.

The exact mechanism(s) by which hyperhomocysteinaemia promotes vascular disease remains unclear. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the beneficial effect of folic acid on endothelial function is independent of homocysteine-lowering. In the present study the effect of a low (400 microg/70 kg/day) and high (5 mg/70 kg/day) dose folic acid supplement on endothelium-dependent relaxation in the isolated perfused mesenteric bed of heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficient mice was investigated. Elevated total plasma homocysteine and impaired relaxation responses to methacholine were observed in heterozygous mice. In the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester relaxation responses in wild-type tissues were reduced, but in heterozygous tissues were abolished. Clotrimazole and 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, both inhibitors of non-nitric oxide/non-prostanoid-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, reduced responses to methacholine in wild-type but not heterozygous tissues. The combination of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and either clotrimazole or 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibited relaxation responses in wild-type tissues. Both low and high dose folic acid increased plasma folate, reduced total plasma homocysteine and reversed endothelial dysfunction in heterozygous mice. A greater increase in plasma folate in the high dose group was accompanied by a more significant effect on endothelial function. In the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a significant residual relaxation response was evident in tissues from low and high dose folic acid treated heterozygous mice. These data suggest that the impaired mesenteric relaxation in heterozygous mice is largely due to loss of the non-nitric oxide/non-prostanoid component. While low dose folic acid may restore this response in a homocysteine-dependent manner, the higher dose has an additional effect on nitric oxide-mediated relaxation that would appear to be independent of homocysteine lowering.

Chronic hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an important factor in development of arterial hypertension. HHcy is associated with activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); however, it is unclear whether HHcy-dependent extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation plays a role in arterial hypertrophy and hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that in HHcy the mechanism of arterial hypertension involves arterial dysfunction in response to ECM accumulation between endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells and subsequent endothelium-myocyte (E-M) uncoupling. To decrease plasma Hcy, dietary supplementation with 3-deazaadenosine (DZA), the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, was administered to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) knockout (KO) mice. Mice were grouped as follows: wild type (WT; control), WT+DZA, CBSKO, and CBSKO+DZA (n = 4/group). Mean aortic blood pressure and heart rate were monitored in real time with a telemetric system before, during, and after DZA treatment (6 wk total). In vivo aorta function and morphology were analyzed by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography in anesthetized mice. Aorta MMP activity in unfixed cryostat sections was measured with DQ gelatin. Aorta MMP-2, MMP-9, and connexin 43 expression were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. HHcy caused increased aortic blood pressure and resistance, tachycardia, and increased wall thickness and ECM accumulation in aortic wall vs. control groups. There was a linear correlation between aortic wall thickness and plasma Hcy levels. MMP-2, MMP-9, and connexin 43 expression were increased in HHcy. In the CBSKO+DZA group, aortic blood pressure and levels of MMP and connexin 43 were close to those found in control groups. However, removal of DZA reversed the aortic lumen-to-wall thickness ratio in CBSKO mice, suggesting, in part, a role of vascular remodeling in the increase in blood pressure in HHcy. The results show that arterial hypertension in HHcy mice is, in part, associated with arterial remodeling and E-M uncoupling in response to MMP activation.

OBJECTIVE: Vascular disease is associated with increased plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and homocysteine, and both are increased in renal failure. In cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (CBS) there is severe hyperhomocysteinaemia, precocious vascular disease, and endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether ADMA levels are elevated in CBS patients with and without renal impairment, and whether lowering plasma homocysteine also lowers ADMA.METHODS: We measured plasma homocysteine, arginine, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines, nitrate + nitrite, creatinine and cystatin C in 23 CBS-deficient patients and 24 age-matched controls.RESULTS: In the patients, nitrate + nitrite and the ratio L: -arginine/ADMA were markedly reduced (21.6 +/- 6.1 vs 57.7 +/- 7.5 micromol/L and 132.9 +/- 24.7 vs 181.9 +/- 56.1, respectively, p &lt; 0.001 for both), reflecting endothelial dysfunction. Plasma ADMA for the group was moderately increased (0.55 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.07 micromol/L, p = 0.018), but this was due to significantly higher levels than controls in only those 7 of the 23 patients who had elevated cystatin C levels (0.59 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.07 mg/L, p = 0.007). Posttreatment total homocysteine in patients varied widely (15-285, median 92 micromol/L), but was not correlated with ADMA or other measured variables. In three newly-diagnosed patients, marked reduction of total homocysteine during treatment produced minimal changes in ADMA.CONCLUSIONS: ADMA levels were significantly increased only in the CBS-deficient patients with elevated cystatin C levels, and not in those with normal renal function. The reported relationship between hyperhomocysteinaemia and ADMA may not be direct, but could be secondary to reduced renal function.

OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with risk for cardiovascular disease. A common cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is folate deficiency. We sought to determine whether folate deficiency per se increases arterial permeability (quantitative fluorescence microscopy) and stiffness (vessel elastigraph), and whether the effects of folate deficiency are more severe in the presence of mild HHcy.METHODS AND RESULTS: Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)-deficient mice (CBS(+/-)) and their wild-type littermates (CBS(+/+)) were fed chow containing either standard (Con) or relatively low amounts of folate (LF) for 18+/-3 weeks. Liver folate (microg folate/g liver) and tHcy (microM), respectively, were 12+/-1 and 8+/-1 in CBS(+/+) Con mice (n=12), and 8+/-1 and 8+/-1 in CBS(+/+) LF animals (n=5). Carotid arterial permeability was &amp;38% greater (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/+) LF versus Con mice, but vascular stiffening was unaltered. Liver folate and tHcy, respectively, were 13+/-1 and 11+/-1 in CBS(+/-) Con mice (n=16), and 8+/-1 and 16+/-3 in CBS(+/-) LF animals (n=6). Carotid arterial dextran accumulation was &amp;31% greater, and maximal strain in aortae was &amp;20% lower (both P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) LF versus Con mice.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, low folate (P&lt;0.05) combined with mild HHcy (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) mice produced more arterial dysfunction compared with low folate alone (ie, CBS(+/+) mice). These findings may be particularly relevant to elderly individuals because tHcy and deficiencies of folate metabolism increase with age.

OBJECTIVE: A risk factor for cardiovascular disease, hyperhomocystinemia (HHcy), is associated with endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we examined the mechanistic role of HHcy in endothelial dysfunction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Through the use of 2 functional models, aortic rings and intravital video microscopy of the cremaster, we found that arterial relaxation in response to the endothelium-dependent vessel relaxant, acetylcholine or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activator (A23187), was significantly impaired in cystathionine beta-synthase null (CBS(-/-)) mice. However, the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) response to the nitric oxide (NO) donor (SNAP) was preserved in CBS(-/-) mice. In addition, superoxide dismutase and catalase failed to restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was significantly reduced in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) of CBS(-/-) mice, as well as in Hcy-treated mouse and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Hcy-mediated eNOS inhibition--which was not rescued by adenoviral transduction of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, or by tetrahydrobiopterin, sepiapterin, and arginine supplementations in MAEC--was associated with decreased protein expression and increased threonine 495 phosphorylation of eNOS in HAECs. Ultimately, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X (GFX), reversed Hcy-mediated eNOS inactivation and threonine 495 phosphorylation in HAECs.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HHcy impairs endothelial function and eNOS activity, primarily through PKC activation.

Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (HH) is an established independent risk factor for coronary, cerebral and peripheral vascular diseases. Recent studies have indicated that certain cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, impair expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endogenous angiogenesis. In this study, we investigate the impact of moderate HH on angiogenesis and VEGF pathway in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. Upon induction of unilateral hindlimb ischemia, endogenous angiogenesis, expression of VEGF, and phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1 were evaluated in mice heterozygous for a deletion of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (CBS) and compared with those observed in CBS+/+ mice. CBS+/- mice exhibit moderate HH, as demonstrated by measuring plasma total homocyst(e)ine (tHcy) levels, which were significantly higher in these animals compared with CBS+/+ mice (4.77 +/- 0.82 vs 2.10 +/- 0.28, p &lt; 0.01). Twenty-eight days after induction of ischemia, hindlimb blood flow was significantly reduced in CBS+/- mice compared with CBS+/+ animals (0.49 +/- 0.03, n = 12 vs 0.71 +/- 0.09, n = 10; p &lt; 0.05). In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between plasma homocyst(e)ine levels and the laser Doppler perfusion ratio in CBS+/- mice (p = 0.0087, r = -0.7171). While VEGF expression and Flk-1 phosphorylation were not impaired in the ischemic muscles of CBS+/- mice, phosphorylation of the endothelial cell survival factor Akt was significantly inhibited by homocyst(e)ine in a dose-dependent manner in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) in vitro. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that endogenous angiogenesis is inversely related to plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine in genetically engineered, heterozygous mice with moderate HH. This impairment, however, is not dependent on reduced expression of VEGF or impaired phosphorylation of its receptor Flk-1. In contrast, our data suggest that impaired Akt phosphorylation mediates the impairment of angiogenesis associated with HH.

Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with vascular dementias and Alzheimer's disease. The role of Hcy in brain microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) remodeling is unclear. Hcy competes with muscimol, an gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor agonist. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Our hypothesis is that Hcy induces constrictive microvascular remodeling by altering GABA-A/B receptors. MVEC from wild type, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) knockout (-/-), heterozygote cystathionine beta synthase (CBS-/+), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS-/-) mouse brains were isolated. The MVEC were incorporated into collagen (3.2 mg/ml) gels and the decrease in collagen gel diameter at 24 h was used as an index of constrictive MVEC remodeling. Gels in the absence or presence of Hcy were incubated with muscimol or baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist. The results suggested that Hcy-mediated MVEC collagen gel constriction was ameliorated by muscimol, baclofen, MMP-9, and eNOS gene ablations. There was no effect of anti-alpha 3 integrin. However, Hcy-mediated brain MVEC collagen constriction was abrogated with anti-beta-1 integrin. The co-incubation of Hcy with L-arginine ameliorated the Hcy-mediated collagen gel constriction. The results of this study indicated amelioration of Hcy-induced MVEC collagen gel constriction by induction of nitric oxide through GABA-A and -B receptors.

Arteriosclerosis and its complications, such as heart attack and stroke, are the major causes of death in developed countries. It was believed that age, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking are common risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, overwhelming clinical and epidemiological studies have identified homocysteine (Hcy) as a significant and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In healthy individuals, plasma Hcy is between 5 and 10 micromol/L. One cause of severe hypehomocys- teinemia (HHcy) is the deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which converts Hcy to cystathionine. CBS homozygous deficiency results in severe HHcy with Hcy levels up to 100 to 500 micromol/L. Patients with severe HHcy usually present with neurological abnormalities, premature arteriosclerosis. It has been reported that lowering plasma Hcy improved endothelial dysfunction and reduced incidence of major adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention. The mechanisms by which Hcy induces atherosclerosis are largely unknown. Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain cardiovascular pathological changes associated with HHcy. These include: (1) endothelial cell damage and impaired endothelial function; (2) dysregulation of cholesterol and triglyceride biosynthesis; (3) stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation; (4) thrombosis activation and (5) activation of monocytes. Four major biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the vascular pathology of Hcy. These include: (1) autooxidation through the production of reactive oxygen species; (2) hypomethylation by forming SAH, a potent inhibitor of biological transmethylations; (3) nitrosylation by binding to nitric oxide or (4) protein homocysteinylation by incorporating into protein. In summary, our studies, as well as data from other laboratories support the concept that Hcy is causally linked to atherosclerosis, and is not merely associated with the disease. Although folic acid, vitamin B12 and B6 can lower plasma Hcy levels, the long-term effects on cardiovascular disease risk are still unknown and judgments about therapeutic benefits await the findings of ongoing clinical trials.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is a consequence of impaired methionine/cysteine metabolism and is caused by deficiency of vitamins and/or enzymes such as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Although HHCY is an important and independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that are commonly associated with hepatic steatosis, the mechanism by which homocysteine promotes the development of fatty liver is poorly understood. CBS-deficient (CBS(-/-)) mice were previously generated by targeted deletion of the Cbs gene and exhibit pathological features similar to HHCY patients, including endothelial dysfunction and hepatic steatosis. Here we show abnormal lipid metabolism in CBS(-/-) mice. Triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid levels were markedly elevated in CBS(-/-) mouse liver and serum. The activity of thiolase, a key enzyme in beta-oxidation of fatty acids, was significantly impaired in CBS(-/-) mouse liver. Hepatic apolipoprotein B100 levels were decreased, whereas serum apolipoprotein B100 and very low density lipoprotein levels were elevated in CBS(-/-) mice. Serum levels of cholesterol/phospholipid in high density lipoprotein fractions but not of total cholesterol/phospholipid were decreased, and the activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was severely impaired in CBS(-/-) mice. Abnormal high density lipoprotein particles with higher mobility in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were observed in serum obtained from CBS(-/-) mice. Moreover, serum cholesterol/triglyceride distribution in lipoprotein fractions was altered in CBS(-/-) mice. These results suggest that hepatic steatosis in CBS(-/-) mice is caused by or associated with abnormal lipid metabolism.

Increased homocysteine is associated with the pregnancy complication preeclampsia and with later-life cardiovascular disease. Although elevated homocysteine persists after pregnancy, the vascular changes of preeclampsia abate with delivery, and cardiovascular disease occurs decades later. This suggests the vasculature during pregnancy may manifest increased sensitivity to homocysteine. We used the cystathionine-beta synthase (CBS)-deficient transgenic mouse to investigate whether hyperhomocysteinemia would differentially affect vascular function in nonpregnant and pregnant animals. Mesenteric arteries from nonpregnant and midpregnant (14 to 16 days) wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous CBS-deficient transgenic mice were investigated for their response to vasoconstriction, endothelial-dependent, and endothelial-independent relaxation using an isometric wire myograph system. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was similar in arteries from nonpregnant heterozygous and wild-type mice. In contrast, endothelial-dependent relaxation was reduced significantly in arteries from pregnant heterozygous animals compared with wild-type mice. Inhibition of NO synthesis blunted relaxation in arteries from pregnant wild-type but not pregnant heterozygous mice. Endothelial-dependent relaxation was restored by in vitro pretreatment with the tetrahydrobiopterin precursor sepiapterin. These data indicate that in pregnant mice, endothelial-dependent vasodilation is more sensitive to the effect of increased homocysteine than arteries from nonpregnant mice. This effect appears to result from a loss in NO-mediated relaxation that may be mediated by the oxidative inactivation of the NO synthase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Mutations in the enzymes responsible for homocysteine metabolism, particularly cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), result in severe forms of HHcy. Additionally, nutritional deficiencies in B vitamin cofactors required for homocysteine metabolism, including folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), and/or B12 (methylcobalamin), can induce HHcy. Studies using animal models of genetic- and diet-induced HHcy have recently demonstrated a causal relationship between HHcy, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Dietary enrichment in B vitamins attenuates these adverse effects of HHcy. Although oxidative stress and activation of proinflammatory factors have been proposed to explain the atherogenic effects of HHcy, recent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that HHcy induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This review summarizes the current role of HHcy in endothelial dysfunction and explores the cellular mechanisms, including ER stress, that contribute to atherothrombosis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperhomocysteinemia is an emerging risk factor for stroke, but little is known about effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on cerebral vascular function. We tested the hypothesis that chronic hyperhomocysteinemia in mice causes endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arterioles through a mechanism that involves superoxide.METHODS: Mice heterozygous for a targeted disruption of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (Cbs+/-) and their wild type littermates (Cbs+/+) were fed either a control diet or a high-methionine diet for 10 to 12 months.RESULTS: Plasma total homocysteine was elevated with the high-methionine diet compared with the control diet for both Cbs+/+ (7.9+/-1.0 versus 5.0+/-0.5 micromol/L; P&lt;0.05) and Cbs+/- (20.5+/-3.1 versus 8.2+/-0.9 micromol/L; P&lt;0.001) mice. Dilatation of cerebral arterioles ( approximately 30 microm baseline diameter) was measured in vivo in response to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine or the endothelium-independent dilator nitroprusside. Vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired with the high-methionine diet compared with the control diet for both Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/- mice (P&lt;0.01). Dilatation of arterioles to acetylcholine was restored toward normal by the superoxide scavenger tiron (P&lt;0.05). Vasodilatation to nitroprusside was not influenced by Cbs genotype or diet. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining for vascular superoxide was elevated in Cbs+/- mice fed the high-methionine diet and was inhibited by apocynin or Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, implicating NAD(P)H oxidase and nitric oxide synthase as potential sources of superoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Superoxide is a key mediator of endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral circulation during diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia.

As the average human lifespan increases, so does the recognition that advancing age is associated with changes in nutrient intake and requirements as a consequence of biological, social, and pathological factors. Studies show that whereas protein requirements may not differ significantly between younger and older adults, the adaptive mechanisms and responses to nutritional or pathological stressors may differ and alter the balance between requirement and toxicity of specific amino acids (AAs). As an individual gets older, cardiovascular disease and cancer become the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Advancing age is also associated with changes in appetite, food intake, and physical activity, all of which can influence protein and AA metabolism. The sulfur amino acids (SAAs) methionine and cysteine recently attracted attention because of their pivotal roles in methyl group metabolism and maintenance of the cellular redox state. Methionine, an indispensable AA, is important for methylation reactions and as a precursor for cysteine, which is the rate-limiting AA for glutathione (GSH) synthesis. On one hand, high intake levels or blood concentrations of methionine are associated with adverse consequences such as hyperhomocysteinemia and endothelial dysfunction, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, methionine deficiency is reported to lower the threshold of chemical-induced toxicity and play a role in carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is evident that understanding the biological significance of the interrelationship between SAAs, GSH, and methyl group metabolism is key to determining optimal dietary intakes of SAAs in older individuals.

Atherosclerosis is an important medical problem of the 21st century, but traditional risk factors could only account for 50% of the problem. Hyperhomocysteinemia is emerging as an independent atherosclerosis risk factor, associated with folate deficiency, renal failure, and relative deficiency of MTHFR (C677T polymorphism) or other enzymes depending on gender, age, and smoking status. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to occur in 11-22% of western people, in 3-5% of normal asymptomatic Chinese subjects aged 18-70 years in Hong Kong, Macau, Sydney, and San Francisco, 23-36% of Chinese in Hong Kong with premature coronary artery disease, and 29% of a nonselective series of coronary subjects in Hong Kong. Evidence is accumulating that documents its associations with atherosclerosis disease in both case-control observations and prospective cohort studies, in vitro experiments, and in vivo experimental models in both animals and human subjects, as well as the successful improvement by homocysteine-lowering of endothelial function as surrogate atherosclerosis endpoints in asymptomatic human and coronary patients (secondary prevention). A number of large scale homocysteine-lowering trials are currently underway for stroke and heart attacks prevention. Collectively these trials will include more than 65,000 patients at high-risk for cardiovascular and stroke events, and should provide a reliable evidence-base for prevention.

To test the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia was due to increased levels of nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in response to antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) -/+ mice were bred, tail tissue was analyzed for genotype by PCR, and tail vein blood was analyzed for homocysteine (Hcy) by spectrofluorometry. To induce PPAR-alpha, mice were administered 8 microg/ml of ciprofibrate (CF) and grouped: 1) wild type (WT), 2) WT + CF, 3) CBS, 4) CBS + CF (n = 6 in each group). In these four groups of mice, plasma Hcy was 3.0 +/- 0.2, 2.5 +/- 1.2, 15.2 +/- 2.6 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 11.0 +/- 2.9 micromol/l. Mouse urinary protein was 110 +/- 11, 86 +/- 6, 179 +/- 13, 127 +/- 9 microg.day(-1). kg(-1) by Bio-Rad dye binding assay. Aortic nitrotyrosine was 0.099 +/- 0.012, 0.024 +/- 0.004, 0.132 +/- 0.024 (P &lt; 0.01 compared with WT), 0.05 +/- 0.01 (scan unit) by Western analysis. MMP-2 activity was 0.053 +/- 0.010, 0.024 +/- 0.002, 0.039 +/- 0.009, 0.017 +/- 0.006 (scan unit) by zymography. MMP-9 was specifically induced in CBS -/+ mice and inhibited by CF treatment. Systolic blood pressure (SPB) was 90 +/- 2, 88 +/- 16, 104 +/- 8 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 96 +/- 3 mmHg. Aortic wall stress [(SPB. radius(2)/wall thickness)/2(radius + wall thickness)] was 10.2 +/- 1.9, 9.7 +/- 0.2, 16.6 +/- 0.8 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 13.1 +/- 2.1 dyn/cm(2). The results suggest that Hcy increased aortic wall stress by increasing nitrotyrosine and MMP-9 activity.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effects of short- and long-term vitamin C therapy on endothelial dysfunction in patients with homocystinuria.BACKGROUND: Untreated homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is associated with premature atherothrombotic disease; 25% of untreated patients suffer a vascular event by the age of 16 years and 50% by 29 years. Treatment directed at reducing homocysteine accumulation significantly reduces this risk. However, despite 'optimal' treatment and compliance, hyperhomocysteinaemia usually persists and individuals exhibit endothelial dysfunction indicative of an adverse cardiovascular prognosis. Additional intervention is therefore required to further reduce cardiovascular risk.METHODS: We investigated the endothelial effects of acute (2 g single dose) and chronic (1 g/day for 6 months) administration of oral vitamin C in 5 patients with homocystinuria (mean age 26 years, 1 male) and 5 age- and sex-matched controls. Brachial artery endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent responses to nitroglycerin (NTG) were measured using high-resolution ultrasonic vessel wall-tracking.RESULTS: Baseline: Plasma total homocysteine was 100.8 +/- 61.6 and 9.2 +/- 1.9 micromol/L in the patient and control groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). FMD responses were impaired in the patient group (20 +/- 40 microm) compared with the controls (116 +/- 30 microm) (p &lt; 0.001). Vitamin C administration: FMD responses in the patient group improved both acutely, 160 +/- 65 microm at 4 h (p &lt; 0.001), and chronically, 170 +/- 70 microm at 2 weeks (p &lt; 0.001) and 170 +/- 40 microm at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001). FMD responses in the control group were unaltered (p = 0.526). Within both groups, neither the vascular response to NTG nor plasma homocysteine was altered (p &gt; 0.4).CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in patients with homocystinuria, independent of changes in homocysteine concentration and should therefore be considered as an additional adjunct to therapy to reduce the potential long-term risk of atherothrombotic disease.

Previous in vitro experiments have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia leads to oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide, in part by inhibiting the expression of cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1). To elucidate the role of intracellular redox status on homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidant stress, heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS(-/+)) and wild-type (CBS(+/+)) mice were treated with the cysteine donor L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC). CBS(-/+) mice had significantly lower GPx-1 activity compared with their CBS(+/+) littermates, and OTC treatment led to a modest increase in tissue GPx-1 activity and significant increases in total thiols and in reduced glutathione levels in both CBS(+/+) and CBS(-/+) mice. Superfusion of the mesentery with beta-methacholine or bradykinin produced dose-dependent vasodilation of mesenteric arterioles in CBS(+/+) mice and in CBS(+/+) mice treated with OTC. In contrast, mesenteric arterioles from CBS(-/+) mice manifested dose-dependent vasoconstriction in response to both agonists. OTC treatment of CBS(-/+) mice restored normal microvascular vasodilator reactivity to beta-methacholine and bradykinin. These findings demonstrate that mild hyperhomocysteinemia leads to endothelial dysfunction in association with decreased bioavailable nitric oxide. Increasing the cellular thiol and reduced glutathione pools and increasing GPx-1 activity restores endothelial function. These findings emphasize the importance of intracellular redox balance for nitric oxide bioactivity and endothelial function.

Homocyst(e)ine (Hcy) inhibits the expression of the antioxidant enzyme cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) in vitro and in vivo, which can lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species that inactivate NO and promote endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of GPx-1 can restore the normal endothelial phenotype in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic states. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS((-/+))) mice and their wild-type littermates (CBS((+/+))) were crossbred with mice that overexpress GPx-1 [GPx-1((tg+)) mice]. GPx-1 activity was 28% lower in CBS((-/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) compared with CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) mice (P &lt; 0.05), and CBS((-/+)) and CBS((+/+)) mice overexpressing GPx-1 had 1.5-fold higher GPx-1 activity compared with GPx-1 nontransgenic mice (P &lt; 0.05). Mesenteric arterioles of CBS((-/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) mice showed vasoconstriction to superfusion with beta-methacholine and bradykinin (P &lt; 0.001 vs. all other groups), whereas nonhyperhomocyst(e)inemic mice [CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) and CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg+)) mice] demonstrated dose-dependent vasodilation in response to both agonists. Overexpression of GPx-1 in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic mice restored the normal endothelium-dependent vasodilator response. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were transiently transfected with GPx-1 and incubated with dl-homocysteine (HcyH) or l-cysteine. HcyH incubation decreased GPx-1 activity in sham-transfected BAEC (P &lt; 0.005) but not in GPx-1-transfected cells. Nitric oxide release from BAEC was significantly decreased by HcyH but not cysteine, and GPx-1 overexpression attenuated this decrease. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of GPx-1 can compensate for the adverse effects of Hcy on endothelial function and suggest that the adverse vascular effects of Hcy are at least partly mediated by oxidative inactivation of NO.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, but it is not certain whether it is a mediator of vascular dysfunction or a marker for another risk factor. Homocysteine levels are regulated by folate bioavailability and also by the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and its metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). We tested the hypotheses that endothelial dysfunction occurs in hyperhomocysteinemic mice in the absence of folate deficiency and that levels of SAM and SAH are altered in mice with dysfunction. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS(+/-)) and wild-type (CBS(+/+)) mice were fed a folate-replete, methionine-enriched diet. Plasma levels of total homocysteine were elevated in CBS(+/-) mice compared with CBS(+/+) mice after 7 weeks (27.1+/-5.2 versus 8.8+/-1.1 micromol/L; P&lt;0.001) and 15 weeks (23.9+/-3.0 versus 13.0+/-2.3 micromol/L; P&lt;0.01). After 15 weeks, but not 7 weeks, relaxation of aortic rings to acetylcholine was selectively impaired by 35% (P&lt;0.05) and thrombomodulin anticoagulant activity was decreased by 20% (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) mice. Plasma levels of folate did not differ between groups. Levels of SAH were elevated approximately 2-fold in liver and brain of CBS(+/-) mice, and correlations were observed between plasma total homocysteine and SAH in liver (r=0.54; P&lt;0.001) and brain (r=0.67; P&lt;0.001). These results indicate that endothelial dysfunction occurs in hyperhomocysteinemic mice even in the absence of folate deficiency. Endothelial dysfunction in CBS(+/-) mice was associated with increased tissue levels of SAH, which suggests that altered SAM-dependent methylation may contribute to vascular dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Over the last 30 years, a growing body of evidence has documented the role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) as an independent vascular risk factor. However, the mechanisms through which elevated circulating levels of homocysteine (Hcy) cause vascular injury and promote thrombosis remain elusive. Most findings have been achieved in in vitro studies employing exceedingly high concentrations of Hcy, whereas only a few studies have been carried out in vivo in humans. In homocystinuric patients, homozygotes for mutations of the gene coding for the cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme, abnormalities of coagulation variables reflecting a hypercoagulable state, have been reported. In vitro studies provide a biochemical background for such a state. In homocystinuric patients, an in vivo platelet activation has also been reported. The latter abnormality is not corrected by the bolus infusion of concentrations of hirudin, which determines a long-lasting impairment of the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin; in contrast, it appears at least in part lowered by the administration of the antioxidant drug probucol. During the autooxidation of Hcy in plasma, reactive oxygen species are generated. The latter initiate lipid peroxidation in cell membranes (potentially responsible for endothelial dysfunction) and in circulating lipoproteins. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) may trigger platelet activation as well as some of the hemostatic abnormalities reported in such patients. Thus the oxidative stress induced by Hcy may be a key process in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in HHcy. Accumulation of adenosylhomocysteine in cells (a consequence of high circulating levels of homocysteine) inhibits methyltransferase enzymes, in turn preventing repair of aged or damaged cells. This mechanism has been recently documented in patients with renal failure and HHcy and provides an additional direction to be followed to understand the tendency to thrombosis in moderate HHcy.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thrombosis. Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with impaired endothelial function, but the mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia are poorly understood. We have used genetic and dietary approaches to produce hyperhomocysteinemia in mice. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice (CBS +/-), which have a selective defect in homocysteine transsulfuration, and wild-type (CBS +/+) littermates were fed either a control diet or a diet that is relatively deficient in folic acid for 6 wk. Plasma total homocysteine was 5.3 +/- 0.7 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 6.4 +/- 0.6 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.3) given the control diet. Plasma total homocysteine was 11.6 +/- 4.5 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 25.1 +/- 3.2 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.004) given a low-folate diet. In mice fed the control diet, relaxation of aortic rings in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine did not differ significantly between CBS +/+ mice and CBS +/- mice. In contrast, in mice fed a low-folate diet, maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was markedly impaired in CBS +/- mice (58 +/- 9%) compared with CBS +/+ mice (84 +/- 4%) (P = 0.01). No differences in relaxation to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside were observed among the four groups of mice. These data indicate that CBS-deficient mice are predisposed to hyperhomocysteinemia during dietary folate deficiency, and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with marked impairment of endothelial function in mice.

Homocysteine is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications. We have employed an animal model to explore the hypothesis that an increase in reactive oxygen species and a subsequent loss of nitric oxide bioactivity contribute to endothelial dysfunction in mild hyperhomocysteinemia. We examined endothelial function and in vivo oxidant burden in mice heterozygous for a deletion in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, by studying isolated, precontracted aortic rings and mesenteric arterioles in situ. CBS(-/+) mice demonstrated impaired acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation and a paradoxical vasoconstriction of mesenteric microvessels in response to superfusion of methacholine and bradykinin. Cyclic GMP accumulation following acetylcholine treatment was also impaired in isolated aortic segments from CBS(-/+) mice, but aortic relaxation and mesenteric arteriolar dilation in response to sodium nitroprusside were similar to wild-type. Plasma levels of 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) (8-IP) were somewhat increased in CBS(-/+) mice, but liver levels of 8-IP and phospholipid hydroperoxides, another marker of oxidative stress, were normal. Aortic tissue from CBS(-/+) mice also demonstrated greater superoxide production and greater immunostaining for 3-nitrotyrosine, particularly on the endothelial surface. Importantly, endothelial dysfunction appears early in CBS(-/+) mice in the absence of structural arterial abnormalities. Hence, mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to reduced CBS expression impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation, likely due to impaired nitric oxide bioactivity, and increased oxidative stress apparently contributes to inactivating nitric oxide in chronic, mild hyperhomocysteinemia.

The sulfur-containing amino acid, homocysteine, is formed from the essential amino acid methionine, and a number of B vitamins are involved in methionine metabolism. Pyridoxine, vitamin B6, is a cofactor for cystathionine beta synthase, which mediates the transformation of homocysteine to cystathionine, the initial step in the transsulfuration pathway and the urinary excretion of sulfur. In a normal diet there is conservation of the carbon skeleton, and about 50% of the homocysteine formed is remethylated to methionine via steps that require folic acid and vitamin B12. A deficiency of any of these three vitamins leads to modest homocyst(e)ine elevation, as does diminished renal function, both of which are common in the elderly. It is also established that homocyst(e)ine elevation of this order is associated with increased cardiovascular risk but is also associated with most established risk factors, although it is thought to be an independent contributor. In the inborn error of metabolism homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency there is greatly increased circulating homocyst(e)ine and a clear association with precocious vascular disease. In about 50% of these patients there is a vascular event before the age of 30 years. The homocysteine-induced adverse vascular changes appear to result from endothelial and smooth muscle cell effects and increased thrombogenesis. We have documented a highly significant reduction in the occurrence of vascular events during 539 patient years of treatment in 32 patients with cystathionine beta synthase deficiency (mean age 30 years, range 9-66 years) by aggressive homocyst(e)ine lowering with pyridoxine, folic acid, and B12 (p = 0.0001). The 15 pyridoxine nonresponsive patients also received oral betaine. Although a cause and effect relationship is postulated for the increased cardiovascular risk associated with mild homocysteine elevation, a common cause of this elevation is the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. Homozygotes occur in about 11% of Caucasian populations. However, the mutation is not associated with increased coronary risk. Since mild homocysteine elevation is easily normalized by B vitamin supplementation, usually with folic acid, it remains for controlled clinical trials of this inexpensive therapy to determine whether normalizing mild homocyst(e)ine elevation reduces cardiovascular risk.

The possibility that modest elevations in the level of blood homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinaemia) could contribute to cardiovascular disease arose from investigation of patients with rare, severe homocysteine elevations caused by cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Such patients often had thromboembolic events before the age of 30 years. Since the established cardiovascular risk factors could only partly account for the occurrence and severity of vascular disease in the general population, other risk factors had to exist, and homocysteine elevation seemed to be a possible candidate. Australian case-control studies identified an association between mild homocysteine elevation and early-onset coronary disease, and also with chronic renal failure. Patients in the latter group have a high prevalence of unexplained vascular disease and particularly high homocysteine levels. Such elevations in levels of homocysteine in vascular patients could usually be normalised by daily supplementation with folic acid (1-5 mg) while in patients with chronic renal failure 5 mg of folic acid daily markedly reduced the increased concentrations of homocysteine. These initial observations have been confirmed by many investigators and biologically plausible mechanisms for homocysteine-induced vascular dysfunction, and particularly endothelial dysfunction, have been identified. However, associations between hyperhomocysteinaemia and other risk factors, such as smoking and hypertension, have also been documented and need to be controlled for when assessing any increase in risk that homocysteine may independently confer. Although it has been established that lowering the greatly elevated blood homocysteine levels in homocystinuria, due to cystathione beta-synthase deficiency, unquestionably reduces cardiovascular risk, it remains to be determined whether normalising mild homocysteine elevation could reduce cardiovascular risk. Trials to test this possibility have been initiated and others are planned.

The objectives were firstly to assess the evidence that homocysteine is a significant and independent risk factor for vascular disease with special reference to cardiovascular disease, and secondly to evaluate the evidence that a food staple fortified with folic acid will reduce this problem on a population basis. The structure of plasma homocysteine (tHcy) is described. Homocysteine, a highly reactive compound, is synthesized from the amino acid, methionine, and is metabolized by two pathways, the catabolic transsulphuration route via cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and the remethylation path using 5-methyltetrahy-drofolate polyglutamate, the product of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; EC 1.1.1.171), via the cobalamin dependent enzyme, methionine synthase (MS; EC 2.1.1.13).The mechanisms whereby hyper-tHcy is produced include both increased rates of synthesis and decreased metabolism. The latter may occur owing to nutritional deficiency of the vitamin cofactors which are necessary for the normal function of the metabolic enzymes. In particular, folate is required for methylene reductase, pyridoxal phosphate for cystathionine synthase and cobalamin for methionine synthase. When these vitamins are deficient hyper-tHcy is induced and this occurs especially in the elderly. Alternatively, a variant form of methylene reductase has recently been described which occurs in nearly 10% of the normal population. This variant is associated with hyper-tHcy, especially in situations associated with a low folate nutritional status. Meta-analysis of both retrospective case-control studies, nested prospective case-control surveys and a secondary trial of mortality in postmyocardial infarct patients have shown that the association of hyper-tHcy with vascular disease is beyond doubt. This has been further supported by direct assessments of the degree of vascular disease in the carotid brachial and aortic arteries in relation to tHcy levels. Furthermore, treatment with a cocktail of the vitamin cofactors has produced lowering of tHcy levels and regression of the vascular disease in the carotid arteries of affected individuals. Suggested pathogenic mechanisms in vascular disease induced by hyper-tHcy include vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, smooth muscle proliferation and derangements of normal intravascular regulation mechanisms. A variety of clinical conditions are known to be associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic complications. Some of these are associated with hyper-tHcy. Low physiological doses of folic acid, as well as pharmocological doses, lower tHcy. However, because of the poor bioavailability of food folate (50%) and the considerable chemical instability of the naturally occurring reduced forms of folate, in most people it would require unacceptably high consumption of green vegetables to accomplish the necessary increase in intracellular folate and reduction in tHcy. Accordingly, folic acid, the nonreduced synthetic form of the vitamin, which is 100% bioavailable and chemically extremely stable, should be added to a food staple such as flour to ensure maximum protection for most of the population.

The mechanism by which homocysteine causes endothelial cell (EC) injury and/or dysfunction is not fully understood. To examine the stress-inducing effects of homocysteine on ECs, mRNA differential display and cDNA microarrays were used to evaluate changes in gene expression in cultured human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to homocysteine. Here we show that homocysteine increases the expression of GRP78 and GADD153, stress-response genes induced by agents or conditions that adversely affect the function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Induction of GRP78 was specific for homocysteine because other thiol-containing amino acids, heat shock or H2O2 did not appreciably increase GRP78 mRNA levels. Homocysteine failed to elicit an oxidative stress response in HUVEC because it had no effect on the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) including HSP70, nor did it activate heat shock transcription factor 1. Furthermore homocysteine blocked the H2O2-induced expression of HSP70. In support of our findings in vitro, steady-state mRNA levels of GRP78, but not HSP70, were elevated in the livers of cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice with hyperhomocysteinaemia. These studies indicate that the activation of stress response genes by homocysteine involves reductive stress leading to altered ER function and is in contrast with that of most other EC perturbants. The observation that homocysteine also decreases the expression of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and natural killer-enhancing factor B suggests that homocysteine could potentially enhance the cytotoxic effect of agents or conditions known to cause oxidative stress.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CS) deficiency is the most common inborn error of methionine metabolism. Patients with CS-deficiency have an extremely high risk of vascular disease. The underlying mechanism is still unsolved. Dysfunction of endothelial cells could be the trigger in the formation of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Therefore, differences in cell function were studied between normal and CS-deficient human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in culture media as a measure of homocysteine export increased in all cell lines, including the cell line with CS-deficiency, with constant amounts of approximately 2.5 microM every 24 h. von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in culture media were used as markers of endothelial function and increased also with progression of culture time. The effects of additions of folate, vitamin B6 and methionine to the culture medium were studied. The homocysteine export and the markers of endothelial function did not differ between the control and the CS-deficient HUVECs under various test conditions. These data show that CS-deficient endothelial cells have normal homocysteine export and normal endothelial cell function. In CS-deficient patients the very high blood levels of homocysteine, probably due to deficient CS function in liver and kidney, seems to be the hazardous factor to endothelial cells, thus promoting atherosclerosis and thrombosis in CS-deficient patients.

BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease complicated by early and aggressive occlusive arterial disease. This may be related to the grossly increased homocysteine concentrations seen in this disease. More recently, milder hyperhomocysteinemia has been proposed as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease.SUMMARY: Many patients with homozygous homocystinuria develop severe premature atherosclerosis and thromboembolism, probably caused by abnormally high concentrations of homocysteine. Homocysteine undergoes metabolism either by remethylation or transsulfuration, and deficiency or dysfunction of any of the substances that regulate these reactions may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine may have adverse effects on platelets, clotting factors, and endothelial cells. Studies have demonstrated significantly higher plasma homocysteine levels in patients with occlusive arterial disease than in controls. The causes are not clearly understood but may include deficiency of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid and heterozygosity for cystathionine synthase deficiency. Vitamin supplementation can lower plasma homocysteine levels.CONCLUSIONS: Whether measuring plasma homocysteine levels in patients with coronary artery disease should be routine and whether treating hyperhomocysteinemia in these patients may reduce the risk of coronary events remains to be determined.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia are inherited disorders of metabolism that are associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease. This study addresses the possibility that different patterns of carotid wall damage and cerebral blood flow hemodynamics are present in these two metabolic diseases.METHODS: Twelve patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (mean age, 24 years), 10 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (mean age, 26 years), and 11 healthy control subjects (mean age, 26 years) underwent a vascular examination by noninvasive methods. B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to obtain measurements of intima-media thickness of common carotid, bifurcation, and internal carotid arteries as an index of atherosclerosis. Cerebral blood flow velocity was estimated from vascular examination of the middle cerebral artery by transcranial Doppler. Systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities were measured. Pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was also calculated.RESULTS: Mean maximum intima-media thickness was 1.4 mm in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, 0.6 mm in patients with homocystinuria, and 0.6 mm in control subjects. The difference between hypercholesterolemic and homocystinuric patients or control subjects was statistically significant (P &lt; .001). Diastolic blood flow velocities were significantly reduced in the middle cerebral arteries of hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or control subjects (P &lt; .05), whereas systolic or mean velocities did not differ. The pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was significantly higher in hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or healthy control subjects (P &lt; .01). A direct relation was demonstrated between pulsatility index of the middle cerebral artery and mean maximum intima-media thickness of carotid arteries on the same side (P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Familial hypercholesterolemia is responsible for diffuse and focal thickening of carotid arteries and possibly also for hyperlipidemic endothelial dysfunction extending to small resistance arteries and leading to a disturbed cerebral blood flow. Patients with homocystinuria due to homozygosis for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency seldom have plaques in their carotid arteries. They are similar to healthy control subjects with regard to both intima-media thickness and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. Therefore, it is unlikely that typical atherosclerotic lesions precede thrombotic events in homocystinuria. However, it is possible that arterial dilatations caused by medial damage lead to thrombosis in homocystinuric patients.
