<p>In the present study, we investigated the antiproliferative activity of Naja ashei full venom (NAV) on human colorectal cancer cells. The NAV-induced antiproliferative effect was associated with cell cycle arrest in S phase and increased number of cells with sub G0/G1 DNA content, which is considered a marker of apoptosis. Apoptosis has also been confirmed with annexin V/PI staining. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential with concomitant increase in cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO protein content. These effects were associated with the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, as well as with PARP cleavage. Moreover, phosphorylation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in NAV-treated HCT116 was observed. In conclusion, our study for the first time documented antiproliferative/pro-apoptotic effect of NAV in colorectal cancer cells. Our results strongly suggest the involvement of mitochondria in NAV induced apoptosis of cancer cells. Future studies are needed to further examine the potential of NAV in the treatment of colon cancer.</p>

<h4>Clozapine impact on c-Fos expression in mild stress preconditioned male rats exposed to a novelty stressor.</h4>
<p>2018 Osacka, Szelle Cernackova, Horvathova, Majercikova, Pirnik, Kiss</p>
<p>Clozapine (CLZ) stimulates several brain areas some of them being sensitive to stress. Aim of the present study was to reveal whether 7-day CLZ administration may: (1) activate the selected forebrain areas; (2) modulate response of these structures to a single forced swimming episode (FSW); (3) modulate response of these structures to FSW after 13-day preconditioning with mild unpredictable stress complex (CMS). Used groups of male Wistar rats: (a) vehicle or CLZ treated for 7 days; (b) vehicle or CLZ treated for 7 days and on the 7th day exposed to FSW; (c) CMS exposed for 13 days, from the 8th day injected with vehicle or CLZ and on the 14th day exposed to FSW. Vehicle or CLZ (10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>  day<sup>-1</sup> in 0.1% acetic acid) were administered intraperitoneally. c-Fos quantification was performed 90 min after FSW in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsolateral (dLS) and ventrolateral (vLS) septum, dorsolateral (DLStr) and dorsomedial (DMStr) striatum, nucleus accumbens shell (NAc shell) and core (NAc core), and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In unstressed animals CLZ increased c-Fos expression in the mPFC, vLS, and PVN. After a single FSW, CLZ decreased the number of c-Fos immunoreactive cells in the vLS, DMStr, NAc shell, and NAc core. In CMS rats, CLZ suppressed c-Fos immunoreactivity in response to FSW in the PVN. Our data indicate that CLZ elicits different impact on neuronal activities in the brain areas studied and modifies the response of these structures to stress. CLZ effect seems to be affected by stress duration.</p>

<p>Primary immune thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia without abnormalities in the erythroid and myeloid/lymphoid lineages. The incidence of ITP in adults is estimated at approximately 1.6-3.9 per 100 000 persons/year. The aim of this study was to analyze a case report of a patient with diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (D69.3) resistant to cyclosporine A therapy as well as an evaluation of factors that could contribute to an inadequate response to cyclosporine A. The results show a multifactorial origin of thrombocytopenia and a possible effect on refractivity to cyclosporine A therapy caused by long-term smoking, MDR-1 gene polymorphism, genetic predisposition to autoimmune diseases, allergic reactions as a manifestation of hypersensitivity in the immune system, controversial compliance of the patient, overcome infections as well as impact of drugs taken.Key words: immune thrombocytopenia refractery form cyclosporine A therapy platelets.</p>

<p>Analogs of anorexigenic neuropeptides, such as prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), have a potential as new anti-obesity drugs. In our previous study, palmitic acid attached to the N-terminus of PrRP enabled its central anorexigenic effects after peripheral administration. In this study, two linkers, <U+03B3>-glutamic acid at Lys11 and a short, modified polyethylene glycol at the N-terminal Ser and/or Lys11, were applied for the palmitoylation of PrRP31 to improve its bioavailability. These analogs had a high affinity and activation ability to the PrRP receptor GPR10 and the neuropeptide FF2 receptor, as well as short-term anorexigenic effect similar to PrRP palmitoylated at the N-terminus. Two-week treatment with analogs that were palmitoylated through linkers to Lys11 (analogs 1 and 2), but not with analog modified both at the N-terminus and Lys11 (analog 3) decreased body and liver weights, insulin, leptin, triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid plasma levels in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Moreover, the expression of uncoupling protein-1 was increased in brown fat suggesting an increase in energy expenditure. In addition, treatment with analogs 1 and 2 but not analog 3 significantly decreased urinary concentrations of 1-methylnicotinamide and its oxidation products N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, as shown by NMR-based metabolomics. This observation confirmed the previously reported increase in nicotinamide derivatives in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and the effectiveness of analogs 1 and 2 in the treatment of these disorders.</p>

<h4>Effect of palmitoylated prolactin-releasing peptide on food intake and neural activation after different routes of peripheral administration in rats.</h4>
<p>2015 Mikulášková, Zemenová, Pirník, Pražienková, Bednárová, Maletínská, Kuneš</p>
<p>Obesity is an escalating epidemic, but an effective non-invasive therapy is still scarce. For obesity treatment, anorexigenic neuropeptides are promising tools, but their delivery from the periphery to the brain is complicated by their peptide character. In order to overcome this unfavorable fact, we have applied the lipidization of neuropeptide prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), whose strong anorexigenic effect was demonstrated. A palmitoylated analog of human PrRP (h palm-PrRP31) was injected in free-fed Wistar rats by three routes: subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p) (both 5 mg/kg) and intravenous (i.v.) (from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg). We found a circulating compound in the blood after all three applications with the highest concentration after i.v. administration. This corresponds to the effect on food intake, which was also strongest after i.v. injection. Moreover, this is in agreement with the fact that the expression of c-Fos in specific brain regions involved in food intake regulation was also highest after intravenous application. Pharmacokinetic data are further supported by results obtained from dynamic light scattering and CD spectroscopy. Human palm-PrRP31 analog showed a strong tendency to micellize, and formation of aggregates suggested lower availability after i.p. or s.c. application. We have demonstrated that palm-PrRP influenced food intake even in free fed rats. Not surprisingly, the maximal effect was achieved after the intravenous application even though two orders of magnitude lower dose was used compared to both two other applications. We believe that palm-PrRP could have a potential as an antiobesity drug when its s.c. application would be improved.</p>

<h4>Peripheral administration of palmitoylated prolactin-releasing peptide induces Fos expression in hypothalamic neurons involved in energy homeostasis in NMRI male mice.</h4>
<p>2015 Pirnik, Kiss, Maletínská</p>
<p>Energy homeostasis is the result of a balance between energy intake and expenditure, and the hypothalamus plays a key role in the regulation of these processes. The hypothalamic prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) is involved in food intake regulation and energy homeostasis, although only its lipidized analogs exert central anorexigenic effects after peripheral administration. The aim of the present study was to delineate the extent of the Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation within the hypothalamic structures involved in food intake regulation after peripherally administered palmitoylated PrRP31 (palm-PrRP31) and to determine whether the anorexigenic effect of peripherally administered palm-PrRP31 influence the activity of hypocretin (HCRT) and oxytocin (OXY) neurons, i.e., the neuropeptides crucially involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The data confirmed an anorexigenic effect of palm-PrRP31 treatment (5mg/kg, s.c.) in mice. In the palm-PrRP31-treated animals, a significant increase in Fos expression was observed in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN), dorsomedial (DMN), and arcuate (Arc) nuclei and in the neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Moreover, significant Fos expression was observed in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) HCRT neurons and PVN OXY neurons after palm-PrRP31 administration. The present findings may indicate that palm-PrRP31 may be involved in energy homeostasis via the activation of several hypothalamic structures. Fos activation of the hypothalamic OXY and HCRT neurons in the PVN and LHA emphasizes the importance of the areas mentioned in the central action of palm-PrRP31.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a frequent metabolic disorder but an effective therapy is still scarce. Anorexigenic neuropeptides produced and acting in the brain have the potential to decrease food intake and ameliorate obesity but are ineffective after peripheral application. We have designed lipidized analogs of prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), which is involved in energy balance regulation as demonstrated by obesity phenotypes of both PrRP- and PrRP-receptor-knockout mice.RESULTS: Lipidized PrRP analogs showed binding affinity and signaling in PrRP receptor-expressing cells similar to natural PrRP. Moreover, these analogs showed high binding affinity also to anorexigenic neuropeptide FF-2 receptor. Peripheral administration of myristoylated and palmitoylated PrRP analogs to fasted mice induced strong and long-lasting anorexigenic effects and neuronal activation in the brain areas involved in food intake regulation. Two-week-long subcutaneous administration of palmitoylated PrRP31 and myristoylated PrRP20 lowered food intake, body weight and improved metabolic parameters, and attenuated lipogenesis in mice with diet-induced obesity.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the lipidization of PrRP enhances stability and mediates its effect in central nervous system. Strong anorexigenic and body-weight-reducing effects make lipidized PrRP an attractive candidate for anti-obesity treatment.</p>

<h4>Anorexigenic lipopeptides ameliorate central insulin signaling and attenuate tau phosphorylation in hippocampi of mice with monosodium glutamate-induced obesity.</h4>
<p>2015 Mikulášková, Holubová, Nagelová, Pirnik, Zemenová, Haluzík, Galas, Maletínská</p>
<p>Numerous epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated that patients who suffer from metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or obesity, have higher risks of cognitive dysfunction and of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Impaired insulin signaling in the brain could contribute to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which contain an abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This study aimed to determine whether potential tau hyperphosphorylation could be detected in an obesity-induced pre-diabetes state and whether anorexigenic agents could affect this state. We demonstrated that 6-month-old mice with monosodium glutamate (MSG) obesity, which represent a model of obesity-induced pre-diabetes, had increased tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and Thr231 in the hippocampus compared with the controls, as determined by western blots. Two weeks of subcutaneous treatment with a lipidized analog of prolactin-releasing peptide (palm-PrRP31) or with the T2DM drug liraglutide, which both had a central anorexigenic effect, resulted in increased phosphorylation of the insulin cascade kinases PDK1 (Ser241), Akt (Thr308), and GSK-3ß (Ser9). Furthermore, these drugs attenuated phosphorylation at Ser396, Thr231, and Thr212 of tau and of the primary tau kinases in the hippocampi of 6-month-old MSG-obese mice. We identified tau hyperphosphorylation in the obesity-induced pre-diabetes state in MSG-obese mice and demonstrated the beneficial effects of palm-PrRP31 and liraglutide, both of known central anorexigenic effects, on hippocampal insulin signaling and on tau phosphorylation.</p>

<h4>Effect of ghrelin receptor agonist and antagonist on the activity of arcuate nucleus tyrosine hydroxylase containing neurons in C57BL/6 male mice exposed to normal or high fat diet.</h4>

<p>Catecholamines participate in the food intake regulation, however, there are no literature data available, dealing with the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in response to stimulation or inhibition of GHS-R (growth hormone secretagogue receptor) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). The present study was focused to reveal whether [Dpr(N-octanoyl) 3ghrelin], a stable GHS-R agonist, itself in doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg (s.c.) or in combination with GHS-R receptor antagonist ([DLys3]GHRP-6) in dose of 10 mg/kg (s.c.), may affect the activity of ARC TH-containing neurons in C57BL/6 male mice fed either with standard (SD) or high fat diet (HFD) that developed a diet-induced obesity (DIO). The data of the present study clearly indicate that both doses of GHS-R agonist stimulated food intake in SD mice and GHS-R antagonist significantly reduced GHS-R agonist orexinergic effect in SD mice and suppressed the voluntary food intake in HFD mice. Both doses of the GHS-R agonist stimulated Fos expression in ARC neurons in both diet groups of mice which was not abolished by GHS-R antagonist pretreatment. Moreover, both doses of the GHS-R agonist significantly influenced the activation of TH neurons in the ARC of SD mice. The GHS-R antagonist also significantly increased TH neurons activation after GHS-R agonist although this effect was less powerful in HFD mice. This is the first study demonstrating response of local ARC TH neurons to peripherally applied GHS-R agonist and antagonist. The present data point out that the response of TH neurons to GHS-R agonist and antagonist is different in normal and DIO mice and extend our knowledge about the further ARC neuronal phenotype responding to peripheral ghrelin. To bring insight into the understanding of the functional significance of the activated TH neurons in ARC, in the context of the ghrelin peripheral increase, further studies are required.</p>

<h4>CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) peptide specific binding sites in PC12 cells have characteristics of CART peptide receptors.</h4>
<p>2014 Nagelová, Pirník, Maletínská</p>
<p>CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) peptide is a neuropeptide with a powerful central anorexigenic effect. Specific CART peptide binding sites, most likely CART peptide receptors, have been found in PC12 cells. This study further characterizes the CART peptide binding sites in PC12 cells. After differentiation to a neuronal phenotype with nerve growth factor, the number of CART peptide binding sites in PC12 cells tripled. Following dexamethasone treatment, which transforms PC12 cells into chromaffin-like cells, the number of CART peptide binding sites substantially decreased. CART peptide did not affect the differentiation or acetylcholinesterase activity of PC12 cells, indicating that CART peptide does not participate in differentiation or neuronal activity. CART peptide increased the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK (stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun-amino-terminal kinase) and subsequent c-Jun protein expression. These effects were reversed by SP600125, a specific JNK-kinase inhibitor. CART peptide did not significantly affect ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein), or p38 phosphorylation and c-Fos protein expression. Central administration of CART peptide into mice also resulted in increased c-Jun positive cells in dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract, areas involved in food intake regulation. Activation of c-Jun by CART peptide might indicate a possible role of CART peptide in managing stress conditions rather than a role in cell proliferation or differentiation as well as the more complex and/or specific regulation ways by transcription factors in some nuclei involved in food intake regulation. The characteristics of stress that CART peptide potentially mediates should be further studied.</p>

<h4>High fat diet impact on Fos expression in ovariectomized female C57BL/6 mice: effect of colchicine and response of different neuronal phenotypes.</h4>
<p>2012 Pirnik, Bundzikova, Kiss</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: Activity of neuropeptide Y (NPY), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), corticoliberine (CRH), and oxytocin (OXY) producing cells was investigated in the ovariectomized (OVX) female C57BL/6 mice kept on the high fat diet for 16 weeks and their response to colchicine stress in selected brain areas, including the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN), dorsomedial (DMN) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei, A1/C1 (in the ventrolateral medulla), and A2/C2 (in the nucleus of the solitarii tract, NTS) catecholaminergic cell groups.METHODS: The OVX female C57BL/6 mice kept on high fat diet were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with fixative 48 h after intracerebroventricular injection of colchicine (18 µg mice). Dual Fos/neuropeptide immunohistochemistry was employed to investigate Fos/neuropeptide colocalizations.RESULTS: In the OVX saline-treated mice (sham control) with standard diet (St diet), no immunopositive CRH and NPY neurons were identified in the PVN and weak Fos immunostainig was visible in TH neurons in the DMN and ARC nuclei. Colchicine treatment in the OVX mice with St diet increased the number of CRH and OXY immunopositive neurons in the PVN as well as the number of NPY and TH neurons in DMN and ARC nuclei and NPY neurons in the middle NTS (mNTS) and A1/C1 cell group. Prolonged HF diet in OVX sham control mice moderately increased the number of Fos/TH neurons in the mNTS and commissural NTS (cNTS) in comparison with St diet mice. However, prolonged HF diet in OVX colchicines-treated mice reduced the number of Fos/NPY neurons in the anterior NTS (aNTS) and A1/C1 cell group in comparison with colchicines-treated animals with St diet as well as Fos-TH neurons in the mNTS and cNTS in comparison with saline-treated animals with HF diet.CONCLUSION: The data of this pilot study indicate that prolonged high fat diet might: 1) represent itself a light/moderate stimulus for activation of TH neurons in the NTS and A1/C1 cell group as well as NPY neurons in the A1/C1 cell group and 2) interfere with colchicines-induced and time-delayed Fos activation in the NPY and TH neurons in both the above mentioned brain nuclei.</p>

<p>Many peripheral substances, including ghrelin, induce neuronal activation in the brain. In the present study, we compared the effect of subcutaneously administered ghrelin and its three stable agonists: Dpr(3)ghr ([Dpr(N-octanoyl)(3)] ghrelin) (Dpr - diaminopropionic acid), YA GHRP-6 (H-Tyr-Ala-His-DTrp-Ala-Trp-DPhe-Lys-NH(2)), and JMV1843 (H-Aib-DTrp-D-gTrp-CHO) on the Fos expression in food intake-responsive brain areas such as the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and area postrema (AP) in male C57BL/6 mice. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that acute subcutaneous dose of each substance (5mg/kg b.w.), which induced a significant food intake increase, elevated Fos protein expression in all brain areas studied. Likewise ghrelin, each agonist tested induced distinct Fos expression overall the PVN. In the ARC, ghrelin and its agonists specifically activated similarly distributed neurons. Fos occurrence extended from the anterior (aARC) to middle (mARC) ARC region. In the latter part of the ARC, the Fos profiles were localized bilaterally, especially in the ventromedial portions of the nucleus. In the NTS, all substances tested also significantly increased the number of Fos profiles in neurons, which also revealed specific location, i.e., in the NTS dorsomedial subnucleus (dmNTS) and the area subpostrema (AsP). In addition, cells located nearby the NTS, in the AP, also revealed a significant increase in number of Fos-activated cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that ghrelin agonists, regardless of their different chemical nature, have a significant and similar activating impact on specific groups of neurons that can be a part of the circuits involved in the food intake regulation. Therefore there is a real potency for ghrelin agonists to treat cachexia and food intake disorders. Thus, likewise JMV1843, the other ghrelin agonists represent substances that might be involved in trials for clinical purposes.</p>

<h4>Brain-liver interactions during liver ischemia reperfusion injury: a minireview.</h4>
<p>2011 Bundzikova, Pirnik, Lackovicova, Mravec, Kiss</p>
<p>KEYWORDS: The liver is a vital organ, with a wide range of functions. This organ plays an important role in the metabolism, including the glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, plasma protein synthesis, hormone production, and detoxification. The liver is innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves which are involved in the regulation of the hepatic metabolism. Tissue injury connected with ischemia and reperfusion has been implicated in several clinical settings, including myocardial infarction, brain ischemia, and organ transplantation. Consequences of the liver ischemia reperfusion injury (LIRI) induce first of all an organ failure and afterwards multiorgan system damages that may eventually lead to a death. Many models with an attempt to reduce harmful consequences of the LIRI, directing to develop a variety of prophylactic strategies, has been introduced including models of warm, cold or normothermic ischemia, ischemic pre- and post-conditionings, pharmacological interventions, etc. In spite of the improvements in the medical care and accumulation of a large amount of experimental data concerning the prevention of ischemia and reperfusion related injuries, many destructive processes explanation still remains problematic.</p>

<h4>Activation of different neuronal phenotypes in the rat brain induced by liver ischemia–reperfusion injury: dual Fos/neuropeptide immunohistochemistry.</h4>
<p>2010 Bundzikova, Pirnik, Lackovicova, Mravec, Kiss</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to reveal the effect of liver ischemia–reperfusion injury (LIRI) on the activity of selected neuronal phenotypes in rat brain by applying dual Fos-oxytocin (OXY), vasopressin (AVP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), corticoliberine (CRH), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) immunohistochemistry. Two liver ischemia–reperfusion models were investigated: (i) single ligation of the hepatic artery (LIRIa) for 30 min and (ii) combined ligation of the portal triad (the common hepatic artery, portal vein, and common bile duct) (LIRIb) for 15 min. The animals were killed 90 min, 5 h, and 24 h after reperfusion. Intact and sham operated rats served as controls. As indicated by semiquantitative estimation, increases in the number of Fos-positive cells mainly occurred 90 min after both liver reperfusion injuries, including activation of AVP and OXY perikarya in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei, and TH, NPY, and PNMT perikarya in the catecholaminergic ventrolateral medullar A1/C1 area. Moreover, only PNMT perikarya located in the A1/C1 cell group exhibited increased Fos expression 5 h after LIRIb reperfusion. No or very low Fos expression was found 24 h after reperfusion in neuronal phenotypes studied. Our results show that both models of the LIRI activate, almost by the same effectiveness, a number of different neuronal phenotypes which stimulation may be associated with a complex of physiological responses induced by (1) surgery (NPY, TH, PNMT), (2) hemodynamic changes (AVP, OXY, TH, PNMT), (3) inflammation evoked by ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (TH), and (4) glucoprivation induced by fasting (NPY, PNMT, TH). All these events may contribute by different strength to the development of pathological alterations occurring during the liver ischemia–reperfusion injury.</p>

<h4>The a2-adrenoceptors do not modify the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, corticoliberine, and neuropeptide Y producing hypothalamic magnocellular neurons ion the Long Evans and Brattleboro rats.</h4>
<p>2010 Bundzikova, Pirnik, Zelena, Mikkelsen, Kiss</p>
<p>The hypothalamic supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei are activated by body salt-fluid variations. Stimulation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors by an agonist-xylazine (XYL) activates oxytocinergic but not vasopressinergic magnocellular neurons. In this study, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), corticoliberine (CRH), and neuropeptide Y(NPY) magnocellular phenotypes, were analysed in response to alpha(2)-adrenoceptor manipulations and sustained hyperosmolality in vasopressin deficient homozygous Brattleboro (di/di) rats. Saline (0.9% NaCl, 0.1 ml/100g/bw), XYL (10 mg/kg/bw), atipamezole (ATIP, alpha(2)-adrenoceptors antagonist, 1 mg/kg/bw), and ATIP 5 min later followed by XYL, were applied intraperitoneally. Presence of immunolabeled Fos peptide signalized the neuronal activity. Ninety minutes after injections, the rats were anesthesized and sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with fixative. Coronal sections of 30 mum thickness double immunolabeled with Fos/neuropeptide were evaluated under light microscope. Under basal conditions, di/di in comparison with control Long Evans rats, displayed significantly higher number of TH, CRH, and NPY immunoreactive neurons in the SON and PVN (except NPY cells in PVN) and more than 90%, 75%, and 86% of TH, NPY, and CRH neurons, respectively, displayed also Fos signal in the SON. XYL did not further increase the number of Fos in the PVN and SON and ATIP failed to reduce the stimulatory effect of hypertonic saline in all neuronal phenotypes studied. Our data indicate that hyperosmotic conditions significantly influence the activity of TH, CRH, and NPY magnocellular neuronal phenotypes, but alpha(2)-adrenoceptors do not play substantial role in their regulation during osmotic challenge induced by AVP deficiency.</p>

<h4>Fos expression in tyrosine hydroxylase containing hypothalamic neurons in CRH-KO mice: effect of immobilization stress.</h4>
<p>2010 Petrak, Bundzikova, Pirnik, Mravec, Kvetnansky, Kiss</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the response of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) containing hypothalamic neurons to stress in corticoliberine deficient (CRH-KO) mice. This study was aimed to extend this issue and reveal the data leading to a better understanding of physiological/anatomical plasticity of hypothalamic TH cells in response to acute immobilization stress (IMO) as well as of possible of CRH body deficiency contribution in the regulation of TH cells during stress. We examined the topographic distribution of TH protein immunolabeled perikarya in selected hypothalamic structures including the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), periventricular (PeVN), arcuate (ArcN), dorsomedial (DMN), and ventromedial (VMN) nuclei and extrahypothalamic zona incerta (ZI) in CRH-KO and wild type (WT) mice.METHODS: The animals were perfused with fixative 120 min after a single IMO stress. The brains were removed, cryo-sectioned throughout the hypothalamus and Fos-TH co-localizations were processed immunohistochemically. Fos protein was visualized by diaminobenzidine (DAB) intensified with nickel ammonium sulphate, while TH cells were labeled only with DAB chromogen. The evaluation of Fos-TH co-labeled perikarya was performed with the use of computerized Leica light microscope and expressed as the percentage of total amount of TH labeled cells.RESULTS: From the qualitative point of view, the present data indicate similar anatomical distribution of TH immunoreactive perikarya in all brain structures investigated in both WT and CRH-KO mice, while from the quantitative point of view only TH cells in the DMN of CRH-KO mice showed a trend for increased activation by IMO.CONCLUSIONS: In several hypothalamic structures the basic population of TH neurons was not affected by the absence of endogenous CRH. Based on the data of this study it can also be assumed that despite of the presence of direct reciprocal connections between PVN and DMN neurons, PVN CRH neurons possibly are not participating in the regulation of TH neurons in the DMN during IMO stress.KEYWORDS: Hypothalamic nuclei - Fos-immunohistochemistry - Tyrosine hydroxylase - Immobilization stress - CRH knockout mice.</p>

<h4>Effect of anorexinergic peptides, cholecystokinin (CCK) and cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptide, on the activity of neurons in hypothalamic structures of C57Bl/6 mice involved in the food intake regulation.</h4>
<p>2009 Pirnik, Maixnerová, Matysková, Koutová, Zelezná, Maletínská, Kiss</p>
<p>The hypothalamus plays an important role in food consumption, receiving information about energy balance via hormonal, metabolic, and neural inputs. Its neurons produce neuropeptides influencing energy balance. Especially important to regulation of food consumption are certain hypothalamic structures, including the arcuate (ARC) and ventromedial (VMN) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). We determined the impact of cholecystokinin (CCK) and cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptide, on activity of ARC and VMN neurons and hypocretin (Hcrt) synthesizing neurons in LHA. ARC is an integrative nucleus regulating food consumption, VMN is considered to be a satiety centre, and LHA a hunger sensing centre. After overnight fasting, male C57Bl/6 mice received intraperitoneal injection of (i.p.) saline (SAL) or CCK (4microg/kg) or intracerebroventricular injection of (i.c.v.) CART peptide (0.1microg/mice) or CCK (i.p.) followed by CART peptide (i.c.v.) 5min later. Sixty minutes later, the presence of Fos or Fos/Hcrt immunostaining indicated activity of ARC and VMN neurons, as well as of Hcrt cells in LHA. CCK alone did not influence neuronal activity in any of the nuclei studied. CART peptide stimulated neurons in ARC and VMN (p&lt;0.01) but decreased Hcrt neuronal activity in LHA (p&lt;0.05). Co-administration of both peptides synergistically stimulated ARC neurons (p&lt;0.01) and asynergistically inhibited LHA Hcrt neurons (p&lt;0.01). Results indicate that CCK may modify the effect of CART peptide and thus substantially influence activity of neurons in hypothalamic structures involved in regulation of food intake.</p>

<h4>Different antipsychotics elicit different effects on magnocellular oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic neurons as revealed by Fos immunohistochemistry.</h4>
<p>2009 Kiss, Bundzikova, Pirnik, Mikkelsen</p>
<p>Acute administration of antipsychotics elicits regionally distinct patterns of Fos expression in the rat brain. Stimulation of oxytocin (OXY) and vasopressin (AVP) release in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei indicates that antipsychotics may play a role in autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral processes. This study was focused to reveal the responsiveness of hypothalamic OXY- and AVP- producing magnocellular neurons, in terms of quantitative and topographical distinctions, to antipsychotics displaying different pharmacological profiles. Naive male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with haloperidol (1 mg/kg), clozapine (30 mg/kg), olanzapine (30 mg/kg), risperidone (2mg/kg), and vehicle (5% chremophor) and were sacrificed 60 min later by a fixative. Fos, Fos/OXY, and Fos/AVP labelings were visualized by immunohistochemistry in the SON, 5 accessory (ACS) cell groups, and 4 distinct PVN subdivisions using a computerized light microscope. Most apparent activation of single Fos, Fos/OXY, and Fos/AVP cells was induced by clozapine and olanzapine; effects of risperidone and haloperidol were substantially lower; no colocalizations were revealed in naive or vehicle treated control rats. The data indicate the existence of a substantial diversity in the stimulatory effect of the selected antipsychotics on quantity of Fos, Fos/OXY, and Fos/AVP immunostainings with the preferential action of the atypicals clozapine over olanzapine and little effects of risperidone and haloperidol. Variabilities in Fos distribution in the PVN, SON, and ACS induced by antipsychotics may be helpful to understand more precisely the extent of their extra-forebrain actions with possible presumption of their functional impact and side effect consequences.</p>

<h4>Response of hypothalamic oxytocinergic neurons to immobilization stress is not dependent on the presence of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH): a CRH knock-out mouse study.</h4>
<p>2009 Pirnik, Petrak, Bundzikova, Mravec, Kvetnansky, Kiss</p>
<p>This study explores the quantitative patterns of immunolabeled Fos protein incidence in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) oxytocinergic (OXY) neurons in response to immobilization (IMO) stress in corticotrophin releasing hormone deficient (CRH-KO) mice. Adult male mice, taken directly from cages or 120 min after a single IMO, were sacrificed by intracardial perfusion with fixative. Coronal brain sections of 30 mum thickness were processed for dual Fos/OXY immunohistochemistry. In control wild type (WT) and CRH-KO mice, scattered Fos immunoreactivity was observed in hypothalamus, including the PVN where scanty Fos signal occurred in both parvocellular and magnocellular PVN subdivisions. Dual Fos/OXY immunostainings revealed higher basal Fos expression in the PVN of control CRH-KO mice. IMO evoked a marked rise in Fos expression in OXY neurons of the PVN and SON in both WT and CRH-KO groups of mice. The present data demonstrate that 1/ CRH deficiency upregulates the basal activity of hypothalamic PVN OXY cells in CRH-KO mice and 2/ IMO stress in both WT and CRH-KO mice affects distinctly the activity of OXY cells in both SON and PVN. Our data indicate that CRH deficiency does not alter the responsiveness of PVN and SON OXY cells to IMO stress.</p>

<h4>Brain response to induced peripheral cancer development in rats: dual fos-tyrosine hydroxylase and fos-oxytocin immunohistochemistry.</h4>
<p>2009 Mravec, Lackovicova, Pirnik, Bizik, Bundzikova, Hulin, Kiss</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: During last few decades a considerable number of data has emerged supporting the hypothesis that central nervous system might monitor and modulate tumor growth. This assumption is based on two facts: 1. immune system plays a crucial role in the development and progression of cancer; 2. immune and nervous systems communicate tightly and bidirectionally. The aim of present study was to elucidate whether tumor growth may induce detectable changes in brain structures that are involved in the response to immune challenges.METHODS: Using Fos immunohistochemistry, we investigated whether the advanced stage of cancer, induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of BP6-TU2 fibrosarcoma cells to male Wistar rats, could activate Fos expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), amygdala and parabrachial nuclei (PBN) and also activate some of neuronal phenotypes including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in the brainstem noradrenergic cell groups and hypothalamic oxytocinergic neurons.RESULTS: Twenty eight days after the initiation of tumor process we found increased Fos expression in NTS/A2, A1 noradrenergic cells, PBN as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular, supraoptic and accessory oxytocinergic neurons. These structures are involved in the transmission of signals related to immune challenges within the brain and consequent elaboration of neuro-endocrine responses.CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained are supporting the view that the information on peripheral tumor development might be transmitted to the brain. However, further studies are necessary to be performed to reveal whether our findings can be attributed to specific effect of cancer or whether observed changes in the activity of brainstem and hypothalamic neurons reflex processes that only accompany the cancer progression.</p>

<h4>Alpha2-adrenergic impact on hypothalamic magnocellular oxytocinergic neurons in long evans and brattleboro rats: effects of agonist and antagonists.</h4>
<p>2009 Bundzikova, Pirnik, Zelena, Mikkelsen, Kiss</p>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that alpha2-adrenoceptors regulate hypothalamic magnocellular oxytocinergic (OXY) neurons in Sprague Dawley rats. Here we investigated whether activation/inhibition of alpha2-adrenoceptors may similarly trigger/downregulate the activity of OXY neurons in control Long Evans (+/+) and permanently osmotically stressed Brattleboro (di/di) rats. The effect of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, xylazine (XYL) and alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists, atipamezole (ATIP), and idazoxan (IDX) were evaluated in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) hypothalamic nuclei. Saline (SAL, 0.1 ml/100 g), XYL (10 mg/kg), ATIP, (1 mg/kg), and IDX (10 mg/kg) and IDX or ATIP followed by XYL were applied intraperitoneally. Rats were sacrificed 90 min later and Fos/OXY co-labelings analyzed in microscope. In control +/+ rats no or few Fos/OXY co-labelings occurred in SON and PVN. XYL significantly increased Fos incidence in OXY neurons in both nuclei. ATIP significantly suppressed the effect of XYL in both nuclei and IDX only in SON. In di/di controls 81% of OXY neurons in SON and 44% in PVN revealed Fos presence and XYL did not further elevate Fos number in SON OXY neurons and slightly increased Fos number in PVN. ATIP or IDX only partially reduced Fos in SAL or XYL treated di/di rats. Our data indicate that: (1) XYL stimulation is not effective in di/di rats because of sustained upregulation of OXY neurons activity and (2) neither ATIP nor IDX reduced significantly the OXY activity in control di/di rats. These findings suggest that alpha2-adrenoceptors have only a limited impact in maintaining OXY cells activity upregulation in PVN and SON of di/di rats.</p>

<h4>Effect of liver ischemia-reperfusion injury on the activity of neurons in the rat brain.</h4>
<p>2009 Pirnik, Bundzikova, Francisty, Cibulova, Lackovicova, Mravec, Kiss</p>
<p>Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) influences different body cells. Little is known about the effect of LIRI on the activity of neurons. Response of neurons to: (1) single ligation of hepatic artery (LIRIa) for 30 min and (2) combined ligation of portal triade (common hepatic artery, portal vein, common bile duct, LIRIb) for 15 min was investigated in Wistar rats. Ninety minutes, 5 h, and 24 h after liver reperfusion, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) serum levels were analyzed and Fos-immunolabeled cells counted in subfornical organ (SFO), suprachiasmatic (SCH), paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), arcuate (ARC), and ventromedial (VMN) hypothalamic nuclei, locus coeruleus (LC), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and A1/C1 catecholaminergic cell groups. LIRIb increased ALT serum level after 90 min and 24 h while AST activity only after 24 h in all experimental groups. IL-1alpha serum level was increased only after 90 min of LIRIb while TNFalpha level did not change. Ninety minutes after surgeries more Fos-immunostained cells occurred in both LIRIs than sham-operated animals in all structures studied. More distinct Fos expression occurred after LIRIb than LIRIa in SON, PVN, VMN, and NTS. Five hours after both LIRIs, Fos increased in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and NTS. Twenty-four hours after both LIRIs Fos incidence decreased in all groups. Although the present data indicate that increased neuronal activity after both LIRIs is mainly a consequence of the liver damage itself partial impact of non-specific factors can not be excluded. However, the anatomical distribution of Fos occurrence detected after LIRIs gives great opportunity to perform a targeted phenotypic identification of the activated neurons by LIRIs in the subsequent experiments.</p>

<h4>Activity of oxytocinergic neurons in the supraoptic nucleus under stimulation of alpha2-adrenoceptors in Brattleboro rats.</h4>
<p>2009 Bundzikova, Pirnik, Mikkelsen, Zelena, Kiss</p>
<p>Vasopressin (AVP) deficient homozygous Brattleboro rats exhibit severe osmotic challenges due to waterless chronic hypernatremia and hyperosmolality. We investigated the effect of xylazine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, on the activity of oxytocinergic (OXY) neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of homozygous (di/di), heterozygous (di/+), and control (+/+) rats. Ninety minutes after saline (0.1 mL/100 g b.w., i.p.) or xylazine injection (10 mg/kg, i.p.) rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.) and sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with fixative. Activity of OXY neurons was evidenced by nuclear Fos protein immunoreactivity. Fos/OXY colabelings were analyzed on 40-mum thick coronal sections using computerized light microscope. As expected, plasma osmolality and water intake revealed high heterogenity within the di/di group of rats. Fos expression in SON of di/di rats was correlated with osmolality of each rat. In saline-treated rats, maximum activation of Fos reached around 4% in +/+, 20% in di/+ rats, and as much as 60% in di/di rats. Xylazine activated in SON about 70% of OXY-ergic neurons in +/+, 60% in di/+ rats, and more than 80% in di/di rats. The present findings indicate that in spite of the high spontaneous activity of SON OXY-ergic neurons due to the AVP deficiency in di/di rats, many of the silent OXY-ergic neurons in the SON remained acceptable for alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulation.</p>

<h4>Activity of brain stem groups of catecholaminergic cells in tumor-bearing rats: response to immobilization stress.</h4>
<p>2009 Pirnik, Bundzikova, Bizik, Hulin, Kiss, Mravec</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunopositive neurons, measured by Fos protein expression, in the hindbrain noradrenergic (NA) cell groups in animals exposed to visceral tumor growth for 28 days induced by intraperitoneal implantation of fibrosarcoma cells. We were also interested in determining whether brain stem NA neurons of tumor-bearing and intact animals exhibit similarities in their response to a strong heterotypic stimulus-immobilization (IMO) stress. We found increased Fos expression in NA cells of the nucleus tractus solitarii (A2 cell group) and of the A1 cell group of tumor-bearing rats. However, Fos expression in other brain stem NA cell groups, including A5, locus ceruleus, and A7, were similar to control rats. The effect of 60 min of IMO was evident in both groups, but there were no differences between Fos expression in brain stem NA cell groups in control and tumor-bearing rats. This indicates that the sensitivity of NA cells in tumor-bearing animals was not altered by the IMO-induced stress challenge. However, whether the increased Fos expression in NA cells in tumor-bearing animals is a consequence of a specific visceral response activated by cancer development or just a nonspecific event accompanying the cancer progression requires further study.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: It is generally known that hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons in lateral hypothalamus (LH) are involved in feeding behaviour. The aim of this study was to reveal the activity response of Hcrt neurons, as measured by Fos protein incidence, to prolonged high fat (HF) diet in the LH of both genders of C57B1/6 mice.METHODS: Standard (St) and high fat (HF) diets were available to mice for 16 weeks and thereafter the animals were perfused transcardially with fixative. Then the brains were removed, soaked with 15 % sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), and cryo-sectioned throughout the hypothalamus into 35 microm thick coronal sections. Fos/Hcrt co-localizations were processed by employing avidin-biotin-peroxidase (ABC) complex and diaminobenzidine chromogen for Hcrt labeling. Fos immunoproduct was intensified by nickel chloride as a black color inducer. Evaluation of the incidence of Fos/Hcrt co-labeled perikarya was performed using a computerized Leica light microscopy.RESULTS: The effect of of mice gender, applied diet, and gender plus applied diet on the activation of Hcrt neurons was found. Turkey s test revealed significant (p&lt;0.05) rise in Fos labeled Hcrt neurons in male vs. female mice after consumption of both types of diets: St (44.64 +/- 2.28 % vs. 1.47 +/- 0.195 %, resp.) and HF (44.15 +/- 3.77 % vs. 24.32 +/- 0.7 %, resp.). This showed that HF diet significantly elevated the number of activated Hcrt neurons only in female mice (24.32 +/- 0.7 % in HF fed vs. 1.47 +/- 0.195 % in St fed, p&lt;0.05). The body weight and accumulation of body fat in animals (body fat weight expressed as % of body weight) were influenced by gender and applied diet, although the body fat weight was influenced by HF diet (more noticeably in females).CONCLUSION: The data indicated a positive correlation between body weight, fat gain, and Hcrt activities in females but not in males, thus accentuating the importance of the gender impact.</p>

<p>2008 Maletínská, Maixnerová, Matysková, Haugvicová, Pirník, Kiss, Zelezná</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) peptide and cholecystokinin (CCK) are neuromodulators involved in feeding behavior. This study is based on previously found synergistic effect of leptin and CCK on food intake and our hypothesis on a co-operation of the CART peptide and CCK in food intake regulation and Fos activation in their common targets, the nucleus tractus solitarii of the brainstem (NTS), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the dorsomedial nucleus (DMH) of the hypothalamus.RESULTS: In fasted C57BL/6 mice, the anorexigenic effect of CART(61-102) in the doses of 0.1 or 0.5 microg/mouse was significantly enhanced by low doses of CCK-8 of 0.4 or 4 microg/kg, while 1 mg/kg dose of CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide blocked the effect of CART(61-102) on food intake. After simultaneous administration of 0.1 microg/mouse CART(61-102) and of 4 microg/kg of CCK-8, the number of Fos-positive neurons in NTS, PVN, and DMH was significantly higher than after administration of each particular peptide. Besides, CART(61-102) and CCK-8 showed an additive effect on inhibition of the locomotor activity of mice in an open field test.CONCLUSION: The synergistic and long-lasting effect of the CART peptide and CCK on food intake and their additive effect on Fos immunoreactivity in their common targets suggest a co-operative action of CART peptide and CCK which could be related to synergistic effect of leptin on CCK satiety.</p>

<h4>Response of substances co-expressed in hypothalamic magnocellular neurons to osmotic challenges in normal and Brattleboro rats.</h4>
<p>2008 Bundzikova, Pirnik, Zelena, Mikkelsen, Kiss</p>
<p>The intention of this review is to emphasize the current knowledge about the extent and importance of the substances co-localized with magnocellular arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXY) as potential candidates for the gradual clarification of their actual role in the regulation of hydromineral homeostasis. Maintenance of the body hydromineral balance depends on the coordinated action of principal biologically active compounds, AVP and OXY, synthesized in the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. However, on the regulation of water-salt balance, other substances, co-localized with the principal neuropetides, participate. These can be classified as (1) peptides co-localized with AVP or OXY with unambiguous osmotic function, including angiotensin II, apelin, corticotropin releasing hormone, and galanin and (2) peptides co-localized with AVP or OXY with an unknown role in osmotic regulation, including cholecystokinin, chromogranin/secretogranin, dynorphin, endothelin-1, enkephalin, ferritin protein, interleukin 6, kininogen, neurokinin B, neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, TAFA5 protein, thyrotropin releasing hormone, tyrosine hydroxylase, and urocortin. In this brief review, also the responses of these substances to different hyperosmotic and hypoosmotic challenges are pointed out. Based on the literature data published recently, the functional implication of the majority of co-localized substances is still better understood in non-osmotic than osmotic functional circuits. Brattleboro strain of rats that does not express functional vasopressin was also included in this review. These animals suffer from chronic hypernatremia and hyperosmolality, accompanied by sustained increase in OXY mRNA in PVN and SON and OXY levels in plasma. They represent an important model of animals with constantly sustained osmolality, which in the future, will be utilizable for revealing the physiological importance of biologically active substances co-expressed with AVP and OXY, involved in the regulation of plasma osmolality.</p>

<h4>Comparison of the obesity phenotypes related to monosodium glutamate effect on arcuate nucleus and/or the high fat diet feeding in C57BL/6 and NMRI mice.</h4>
<p>2007 Matysková, Maletínská, Maixnerová, Pirník, Kiss, Zelezná</p>
<p>In this study, susceptibility of inbred C57BL/6 and outbred NMRI mice to monosodium glutamate (MSG) obesity or diet-induced obesity (DIO) was compared in terms of food intake, body weight, adiposity as well as leptin, insulin and glucose levels. MSG obesity is an early-onset obesity resulting from MSG-induced lesions in arcuate nucleus to neonatal mice. Both male and female C57BL/6 and NMRI mice with MSG obesity did not differ in body weight from their lean controls, but had dramatically increased fat to body weight ratio. All MSG obese mice developed severe hyperleptinemia, more remarkable in females, but only NMRI male mice showed massive hyperinsulinemia and an extremely high HOMA index that pointed to development of insulin resistance. Diet-induced obesity is a late-onset obesity; it developed during 16-week-long feeding with high-fat diet containing 60 % calories as fat. Inbred C57BL/6 mice, which are frequently used in DIO studies, both male and female, had significantly increased fat to body weight ratio and leptin and glucose levels compared with their appropriate lean controls, but only female C57BL/6 mice had also significantly elevated body weight and insulin level. NMRI mice were less prone to DIO than C57BL/6 ones and did not show significant changes in metabolic parameters after feeding with high-fat diet.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed to select a methodical approach to optimize the thickness of cryo-processed free-floating sections for precise recognition between a single Fos signal and Fos/neuropeptide colocalizations in sequential double or triple colored immunohistochemical stainings. For this purpose brain sections of variable (5-20 microm) thickness were tested utilizing enzyme-substrate detection system employing oxytocin (OXY) and vasopressin (AVP) antisera.METHODS: The animals were perfused by fixative 90 min after i.p. administration of 5 ml of hypertonic saline (1.5 M NaCl) which was used to stimulate the hypothalamic osmosensitive neurons. The brains were removed, soaked with 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS, cryo-sectioned throughout the hypothalamus into 5, 10, 15, and 20 microm thick coronal sections, collected and washed in 0.2 M glycine buffer for 10-15 min, and finely stored in 0.1 M PBS. Single Fos and Fos/OXY and Fos/ OXY/AVP colocalizations were processed employing avidin-biotin-peroxidase (ABC) complex and diaminobenzidine chromogen with or without adding Nickel chloride salt as a black and blue color inducer. Evaluation of the Fos-neuropeptide co-labeled perikarya manifestation was performed on a computerized Leica light microscopy.RESULTS: The present data demonstrate that cryoprocessing enables generate free- floating sections of 5, 10, 15, and 20 microm thickness. Except the 5 microm thickness, all the other sections sizes tested exhibited well preserved tissue stability and excellent immunohistochemical properties either for single Fos reaction or double Fos/OXY and triple Fos/OXY/AVP costainings.CONCLUSIONS: We adapted and optimized Fos immunohistochemistry for use of fixed and cryocut processed free-floating brain sections. The present data indicate that except 5 mum thickness all the other sorts of cryosections tested were sufficiently resilient for performing a sequential double or triple colored immunohistochemical stainings. However, 10 mum thickness reached the borderline of the handling safety, therefore, 15 mum section thickness will be the thickness of the choice recommended, which gave relevant immunoreaction, retained good tissue preservation, and ensured an appropriate clarity for accurate recognition between a single and colocalized Fos signals.</p>

<h4>Zolpidem, a selective GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit agonist, induces comparable Fos expression in oxytocinergic neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular and accessory but not supraoptic nuclei in the rat.</h4>
<p>2006 Kiss, Søderman, Bundzikova, Pirnik, Mikkelsen</p>
<p>Functional activation of oxytocinergic (OXY) cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and accessory (ACC) nuclei was investigated in response to acute treatment with Zolpidem (a GABA(A) receptor agonist with selectivity for alpha(1) subunits) utilizing dual Fos/OXY immunohistochemistry. Zolpidem was administered intraperitoneally in dose 10 mg/kg of BW and 60 min later the animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with fixative. The Fos/OXY co-labelings were analyzed on 40 microm thick serial coronal sections using computerized light microscopy. Zolpidem elicited a concordant Fos/OXY staining in all four PVN sub-areas investigated, including the anterior (15.71+/-2.35%), middle (14.52+/-2.53%), dorsal (13.34+/-2.61%), and periventricular (18.21+/-4.75%) ones, however, had no significant stimulatory effect on OXY cells in the SON. In response to Zolpidem, statistically significant activations were also seen in certain groups of accessory structures including the circular nucleus (13.99+/-3.43%), small clusters of accessory neurons (10.55+/-1.94%), and the lateral hypothalamic perivascular nucleus (9.42+/-2.74%). Between the naive and vehicle controls, the dual Fos/OXY labelings did not elicit any significant differences. Our data provide insight into the topographic patterns of brain activity within the clusters of magnocellular OXY cells in the hypothalamus associated with stimulation of GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptors and for the first time illustrate the triggering contemporaneousness within the cells of the principal and accessory magnocellular nuclei in response to Zolpidem treatment. The present study provides a comparative background that may help in the further understanding of a possible extend of Zolpidem effect on the brain.</p>

<h4>Effect of cholecystokinin on feeding is attenuated in monosodium glutamate obese mice.</h4>
<p>2006 Maletínská, Toma, Pirnik, Kiss, Slaninová, Haluzík, Zelezná</p>
<p>Treatment of newborn mice with monosodium glutamate (MSG) is neurotoxic for hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and causes obesity. In the MSG-treated 16-week-old NMRI mice, we detected specific ablation of ARC neuronal cells, 8 times higher fat to body mass ratio but unchanged body mass compared to controls, advanced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia–both more pronounced in males, and hyperleptinemia–more severe in females. After fasting, the MSG-treated mice showed attenuated food intake compared to controls. Cholecystokinin octapeptide, which decreased food intake in a dose-dependent manner in 24 h fasted controls, did not significantly affect food intake in the MSG-treated animals. We propose that the obesity-related changes in the feeding behavior of the MSG-treated obese mice were the result of missing leptin and insulin receptors in ARC and consequent altered neuropeptide signaling. This makes the MSG model suitable for clarifying generally the central control of food intake.</p>

<h4>Effect of pentoxifylline on endothelaemia and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activation in female rats under stress exposure.</h4>
<p>2006 Kristova, Kiss, Pirnik, Kriska, Jezova</p>
<p>Endothelial dysfunction may belong to negative consequences of stress exposure accompanied by activation of several stress systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. The present experiments were aimed at testing the hypotheses that i) immobilization (IMO) stress results in sustained increase in endothelaemia for 24 h and that ii) pentoxifylline, a drug with endothelium protective properties, attenuates the rise in endothelaemia and HPA axis activation in female rats as shown previously in males. Circulating endothelial cells increased immediately after the IMO for 2 h, returned back to control levels at 12 h and increased again at 24 h. Stress-induced rise in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels was particularly high immediately after the IMO. Pretreatment with pentoxifylline (20 mg/kg subcutaneously for 7 days) attenuated the rise in endothelaemia and adrenal corticosterone measured at 24 h following IMO. Plasma levels of ACTH and proopiomelanocortin gene expression in the anterior pituitary were not affected by pentoxifylline treatment. The present results indicate that IMO stress in female rats induces a biphasic rise in endothelaemia early at the time of stress exposure and than 24 h thereafter. Based on these data and our previous study we can conclude that intensive stress has a negative influence on endothelial cells in both sexes and no gender differences seem to be present in the protective action of pentoxifylline.</p>

<h4>Xylazine activates oxytocinergic but not vasopressinergic hypothalamic neurons under normal and hyperosmotic conditions in rats.</h4>
<p>2005 Pirnik, Jezova, Mikkelsen, Kiss</p>
<p>Role of central alpha2-adrenoceptors in the regulation of hypothalamic magnocellular cells was studied under hyperosmotic challenge elicited by hypertonic saline (HS). Rats pretreated with receptor agonist, xylazine (XYL), were injected intraperitoneally with different (low: 0.375, moderate: 0.75, high: 1.5 M) HS 30 min later. The activity of the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) vasopressin and oxytocin perikarya was established by Fos-dual-immunohistochemistry 60 min after HS administration. Results showed that 1/XYL is a potent stimulus for oxytocin but not vasopressin magnocellular cells under basal and weak hyperosmotic conditions 2/highHS completely overlaps the effect of XYL. In addition, XYL partially suppressed Fos expression in the parvocellular PVN cells activated by highHS. The data suggest that alpha2-adrenoceptors may play an important role in the regulation of oxytocinergic PVN and SON neurons under basal and weak hyperosmotic conditions and that alpha2-adrenoceptors may also participate in the control of PVN parvocellular cells under intense osmotic challenge.</p>

<h4>Fos expression variances in mouse hypothalamus upon physical and osmotic stimuli: co-staining with vasopressin, oxytocin, and tyrosine hydroxylase.</h4>
<p>2005 Pirnik, Kiss</p>
<p>Fos expression in the hypothalamus and its quantification in vasopressinergic (AVP), oxytocinergic (OXY) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), suprachiasmatic (SCh), and arcuate (Arc) nuclei was performed in response to physiologically two different, i.e. osmotic (i.p. hypertonic saline, HS) and immobilization (IMO), stimuli in mouse using a dual Fos-neuropeptide immunohistochemistry. Both 60 min of HS and 120 min of IMO evoked Fos induction in many hypothalamic structures, whereas, HS evoked more extensive Fos labeling than IMO in the SON, ventromedial (VMN) and dorsomedial (NDM) hypothalamic nuclei and the retrochiasmatic area (RCh). Other hypothalamic structures including the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), the latero-anterior hypothalamic nucleus (LA), the Arc, the perifornical nucleus (PeF), and the lateral hypothalamic area (LH) showed similar Fos incidence after both HS and IMO. However, after both stimuli explicitly most extensive Fos expression was observed in the PVN. In addition, in the PVN substantially more Fos-AVP (62-67% versus 10-15%) and Fos-OXY (38-45% versus 4-8%) perikarya were observed after HS than IMO, respectively. Incidence of TH-immunoreactive Fos labeled cells in the PVN was also more frequent after HS. In the SON, HS activated more than 50% of AVP and OXY neurons while IMO less than 4%. The number of TH activated neurons in Arc was also higher after HS (11%) than IMO (4%). Lowest number of colocalizations was revealed in the SCh where both HS and IMO activated around 2% of AVP neurons. The present data demonstrate that both HS and IMO are powerful stimuli for the majority of hypothalamic structures displaying considerable topographic similarity in Fos expression suggesting their multifunctional involvement. The quantity and phenotypic differences of activated hypothalamic neurons may speak out for functional dissimilarities in response to HS and IMO.</p>

<p>The aim of the present study was to reveal stress-type dependent differences in hindbrain catecholaminergic (CA) cells and parabrachial nuclei (PBN) in the wild-type mouse. Neuronal activities were evaluated based on the incidence of Fos-labeling analyzed 60 min after injection of hypertonic saline (HS; 400 microL, 1.5 M, i.p.) or 120 min of immobilization (IMO) stress. The phenotypic nature of neurons was identified by costaining of Fos with either tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or the neuropeptide Y (NPY) antibody. Generally, HS elicited broader Fos-staining than IMO. In comparison with IMO, HS induced more extensive Fos activation in the nucleus tractus solitarii-area postrema complex, and in TH- and NPY-positive cells in the A1 and C1 areas. Locus coeruleus (LC) cells displayed similar Fos activation after HS and IMO, and both stimuli also evoked evident TH-Fos colocalizations. Both stimuli also induced TH-Fos costainings in the A5 area. In contrast, IMO failed to activate PBN cells. The data indicate that the activity of TH and NPY hindbrain neurons responds differently to HS and IMO stress, supporting the notion that different stressors have different effects on the activity of autonomic centers.</p>

<h4>Prenatal immune challenge affects growth, behavior, and brain dopamine in offspring.</h4>
<p>2004 Bakos, Duncko, Makatsori, Pirnik, Kiss, Jezova</p>
<p>It is known that the development and plasticity of the neuroendocrine system can be affected by many factors, and that adverse events during the prenatal period can result in long-lasting changes in adulthood. This study was aimed at evaluating the possible consequences for offspring from chronic inflammation during pregnancy. Chronic inflammation was simulated by treatment with increasing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to dams on days 15 through 19 of pregnancy. Attempts were made to prevent possible negative alterations by keeping animals in an enriched environment (EE). Maternal exposure to LPS resulted in a significant reduction of body weight of male offspring during the weaning period. This difference remained until the age of 63 days in controls (C), but not in animals reared in EE. The content of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens was found to be lower in prenatally stressed (PS) adult males. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to maternal immune challenge was associated with lower locomotor activity in elevated plus maze and increased number of skips in the beam-walking test, as observed in female offspring. No differences in ACTH and corticosterone concentrations with regard to prenatal treatment were found; however, both groups kept in EE showed increased levels of corticosterone as well as enlarged adrenal glands. Thus, immune activation during pregnancy may induce long-term changes in brain catecholamines and behavior, but it is not harmful to basal hormone secretion in the offspring.</p>

<h4>Fos protein expression in mouse hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei upon osmotic stimulus: colocalization with vasopressin, oxytocin, and tyrosine hydroxylase.</h4>
<p>2004 Pirnik, Mravec, Kiss</p>
<p>The quantity and topography of activated vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin (OXY), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons were studied immunohistochemically in the anterior, middle, and posterior portions of the PVN and SON in mice 60 min after a single injection of hypertonic saline (HS, 400 microl 1.5M, i.p.). Fos-neuropeptide double-stainings revealed: (1) Fos expression in each portion of the PVN and SON; (2) maximal number of Fos-AVP (79 cells) and Fos-OXY (50 cells) double-labelings in the middle portion of the PVN; (3) low number of Fos-TH perikarya in the PVN and their lack in the SON; (4) similar incidence (around 50%) of Fos-AVP and Fos-OXY perikarya in the SON; and (5) presence of activated AVP, OXY, and TH neurons in the periventricular, subependymal, and sub-PVN zones of the PVN. Topographic analysis revealed that the majority of AVP neurons expressing Fos occupied the dorsolateral and central part of the middle portion of the PVN. In the same PVN portion, Fos-OXY neurons occurred in similar frequency, however, they were primarily distributed along the lateral and medial margins of the PVN. In the SON, Fos-OXY cells occupied mainly its dorsal, while Fos-AVP cells predominated in its ventral part. The data clearly indicate that HS is not a selective stimulus neither for PVN nor SON itself and provide evidence that both PVN and SON AVP and OXY cells play important role in the mediation of signals induced by HS. In addition, the limited number of AVP, OXY, and TH neurons activated by HS may account for their differential functional specializations selective for stress/osmotic circuits activated by HS.</p>

<h4>Stress-induced rise in endothelaemia, von Willebrand factor and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activation is reduced by pretreatment with pentoxifylline.</h4>
<p>2003 Jezova, Kristova, Slamova, Mlynarik, Pirnik, Kiss, Kriska</p>
<p>Stress is considered to be a risk factor of several diseases. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) single exposure to an intensive stressor is followed by endothelial stimulation and/or damage to endothelial cells, (2) potential stress-induced endothelial cell damage is reduced by repeated pretreatment with pentoxifylline and (3) pentoxifylline treatment modifies neuroendocrine activation during stress reflected by changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis function. Rats were treated with saline or pentoxifylline (20 mg/kg, s.c.) once daily for 7 days and then exposed to single immobilization stress for 20 or 120 min. In saline pretreated rats, stress exposure was followed by a rise in endothelaemia, von Willebrand factor concentrations, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone release, as well as by enhanced gene expression of hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor (CRH). Stress-induced changes were reduced by pretreatment with pentoxifylline. Significant inhibition was observed in endothelaemia, plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentration in the adrenals. Thus, signs of endothelial injury as well as stress-induced hormone levels were reduced by pretreatment with pentoxifylline, although there is no evidence for a causal relationship. This protective action of pentoxifylline might be of benefit in the prevention and therapy of some stress-related disorders.</p>

<h4>Fos induction in the rat deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei following central administration of colchicine: a qualitative and quantitative time-course study.</h4>
<p>2003 Pirnik, Mikkelsen, Kiss</p>
<p>The present study was conducted to demonstrate Fos expression at four levels (anterior, prefastigial, postfastigial, posterior) of the cerebellar-vestibular nuclear complex in rats exposed to 1, 6, 24, and 48h of colchicine treatment using a light microscopic avidin biotin peroxidase (ABC) immunohistochemistry. Intracerebroventricular administration of colchicine (60microg per 10microl saline) elicited a continuous increase in the number of Fos-positive cells in the main cerebellar (fastigial, interpositus, dentatus) and vestibular (superior, medial, lateral, spinal, Y) nuclei. One and six hours after colchicine treatment, intensive Fos labeling was observed only in the pyriform cortex and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, respectively, and there was no Fos immunolabeling in any of the cerebellar or vestibular structures investigated. On the other hand, moderate number of Fos-positive cells was visible in each of the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei 24h after colchicine treatment. Exposure of the animals to 48h of colchicine treatment induced an additional, more than 50%, rise in the accumulation of Fos-positive profiles in almost all the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. In addition, at this time-point, a characteristic pattern of Fos distribution appeared almost in all of the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei, however, the numerical incidence of Fos-positive profiles in paired structures along the neuroaxis was bilaterally symmetric. The present data demonstrate for the first time that the central administration of colchicine causes a persistent and, in comparison with other brain areas, time-delayed activation of certain population of neurons in both cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. We assume that the delayed Fos activation in these structures indicate that the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei are not the primary targets of the central effect of colchicine and their activation seems to be rather a result of a postponed functional consequences of the central action of colchicine probably related to the coordination of motor performance.</p>

<li>The intent of the present study was to find out whether dexamethasone pretreatment may affect the induction of Fos protein in cell nuclei of the cerebellar vestibular neuronal complex (CVNC) elicited by central administration of colchicine. Specifically, the rate of the dexamethasone-sensitive cell population was analyzed and compared at different levels of the CVNC using a light microscopic avidin-biotin peroxidase immunohistochemistry. 2. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with dexamethasone 3 days prior (2.5 mg/kg/day, s.c.) and 24 h after an intracerebroventricular delivery of colchicine (60 microg/10 microL). Animals were sacrificed 48 h after colchicine treatment by a transcardial perfusion with fixative. 3. Dexamethasone in itself had no effect on the activity of cells of the CVNC. However, in colchicine treated animals, which exhibited a large number of Fos-positive cells over the entire CVNC, the dexamethasone elicited a substantial reduction in the number of the Fos-immunoreactive cells over the CVNC. Distinct dexamethasone dependent reduction (50-90%) of Fos-immunoreactivity was observed in each of the deep cerebellar nuclei. On the other hand, less number of dexamethasone-sensitive cells were recognized in the vestibular structures. From these, maximal Fos-inhibition by dexamethasone was recognized in the medial vestibular nucleus, however, even in this case the number of suppressed cells did not exceed 50%. 4. The results provide for the first time evidence about the dexamethasone dependent reduction of Fos-immunoreactivity in the cells of the CVNC in response to stimulation elicited by colchicine. The data also indicate that the glucocorticoids might be involved in the regulation of some functions of the CVNC under stress conditions.</li>

<h4>[The cerebellum: anatomy, distribution of mediators and their receptors, communication with hypothalamic structures and comparison with the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus under conditions of stress].</h4>
<p>2002 Pirnik, Kiss</p>
<p>Cerebellum is a profound structure of the central nervous system. Human cerebellum weighs about 150 g which represents around 10% of the total weight of the brain. It receives main input from sensory systems but the cerebellum functions as a part of the motor system. The cerebellum contributes by only few direct connections to motoneurons (therefore it cannot initiate any motor activity) but it projects profusely to all major motor control regions of the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum acts as a controller and coordinator. It compares movement intention with, performance and coordinates the equilibrium, posture and muscle tone necessary for the smooth coordinated motor activity. The number of input projections which exceed considerably the output ones (40:1) speaks out of an enormous analytical and synthetic capacity of the cerebellum. Interneuronal transmission of informations and carriage of afferent and efferent signals are provided by wide variety of chemical messengers (amino acids, biogenic amines and neuropeptides) of the local origin or delivered from the precerebellar nuclei. Direct and reciprocal connections between the hypothalamus and cerebellum have anatomically been well documented but monosynaptic contacts between the cerebellum and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus have not been approved yet. Cerebellum can respond to stress, however, this response may not be related only to the primary effect of the stressor but also to its consequences.</p>

<h4>Detection of oxytocin mRNA in hypertonic saline Fos-activated PVN neurons: comparison of chromogens in dual immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization procedure.</h4>
<p>2002 Pirnik, Kiss</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present experiments was to elucidate: 1. the stability and usefulness of a 3,3 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) chromogen intensified with nickel and cobalt (DAB-Ni-Co) in the dual immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization procedure using Fos-protein antibody and oxytocin mRNA (OXY mRNA) radiolabeled probe; 2. the susceptibility of the free floating and mounted cryostat sections, freshly prepared or stored for 24 month at -20 degrees C.METHODS: The dual staining procedure was tested on neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) activated by an intraperitoneal injection of hypertonic saline (HS, 1.5 M, 5 ml, 60 min). Two dual labeling procedures were compared: 1/ Fos-immunostaining with DAB alone and combined with OXY mRNA in situ hybridization and 2/ Fos-immunostaining with DAB-Ni-Co and combined with OXY mRNA in situ hybridization. In both experiments free floating and mounted cryostat sections, freshly prepared or stored for 24 month at -20 degrees C, were tested.RESULTS: HS strongly stimulated both the parvicellular and magnocellular population of PVN neurons followed by an extensive Fos-immunolabeling in many cell nuclei. The first staining sequence with Fos-DAB labeling resulted in a good staining quality on both the fresh and for 24 month stored mounted sections. Although the free floating sections during the in situ procedure showed the same staining properties as the mounted ones, with respect to their increased fragility on the end of the hybridization procedure, they were difficult to mount and stretch on poly-L-lysine coated slides. On the other hand, Fos-immunolabeling with DAB-Ni-Co exhibited improved staining density of the single DAB chromogen in the first staining sequence of the dual staining procedure. However, DAB-Ni-Co mixture showed up as an unstable chromogen complex, which after completing the in situ hybridization process completely disappeared from each type of section.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present dual immunocytochemical-in situ hybridization staining utilizing Fos-antibody and OXY mRNA oligoprobe indicate that this procedure is applicable on free floating as well as mounted cryostat sections, freshly prepared or stored for 24 month at -20 degrees C. However, the dual procedure is only successful when the immunoproduct in the first sequence is visualized with an unintensified DAB and not with combined DAB-Ni-Co chromogen and when the histological sections in the second sequence are not processed as free floating but are attached to a poly-L-lysine coated microscopic glasses.</p>

<h4>Single dose of morphine influences plasma corticosterone and gene expression of main NMDA receptor subunit in the adrenal gland but not in the hippocampus.</h4>
<p>2002 Pirnik, Schwendt, Jezova</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of morphine on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, namely proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA and plasma corticosterone, in relation to its influence on glutamate receptor gene expression in central and peripheral sites related to HPA axis regulation. As previous data on morphine action were obtained mainly in male rats, these experiments were performed in females to see potential gender differences.METHODS: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with a single dose of morphine (10 mg/kg s.c.) or vehicle. Blood and tissues were sampled 4 h and 24 h following the treatment. In situ hybridization was used to measure POMC mRNA concentrations, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to quantify mRNA coding for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunit 1 and radioimmunoassay to measure plasma corticosterone.RESULTS: Single dose of morphine was followed by a decrease in gene expression of glutamate receptor subunit NMDAR1 in the adrenal gland. Concentrations of mRNAs coding for NMDAR1 in the hippocampus and for POMC in the anterior pituitary remained unaffected. However, plasma corticosterone levels, which were measured at 4 and 24 h after the treatment with morphine, showed a disturbed daily variation in corticosterone release. The efficacy of morphine was confirmed by Straub tail response, one of the classical effects of this drug, in mice.CONCLUSIONS: Present data obtained in females allow to suggest that morphine exerts some of its effects on HPA axis by POMC unrelated mechanisms seemingly in a gender specific manner. Decrease in glutamate receptor gene expression in adrenals induced by a single dose of morphine may result in a modulation of adrenal function in response to subsequent exposure to opioids and contribute to some alterations occurring during opioid drug abuse.</p>
