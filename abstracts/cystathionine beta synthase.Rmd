Wilson disease (WD) is a hereditary metabolic disorder (HMD) caused by a mutation in the copper-transporting gene ATP7B affecting the liver and central nervous system. About 30% of patients with WD may initially present with psychiatric symptoms, and management can be difficult. More generally, HMDs are a rare but important cause of psychiatric disorders in adolescents and adults. Main signs of HMDs may remain isolated for years before the appearance of hepatic or neurologic signs. The incidence of HMDs has been estimated at approximately 40 cases per 100,000 live births. Some of them are treatable and new diagnostic methods and therapies have become available. HMDs that present purely with psychiatric symptoms are very difficult to diagnose due to low awareness of these rare diseases among psychiatrists and neurologists. However, it is important to identify HMDs in order to provide disease-specific treatment and possible prevention of irreversible physical and neurologic complications. Genetic counseling can also be provided. Psychotropic medications should be prescribed carefully in that indication. This chapter focuses on three HMD categories: chronic, treatable HMDs (e.g., WD); acute, treatable HMDs; and chronic HMDs that are difficult to treat. In this review we focus on the psychopharmacology of WD and other chronic and difficult-to-treat HMDs. We provide some keys to take into account the main side effects associated with common psychotropic medications.

There is evidence that oxidative stress involves in homocysteine-induced pathogenesis. Considering the antioxidative properties of folic acid and its involvement as a cofactor for methionine synthase (MS) in the homocysteine-methionine cycle, the aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanism associated with homocysteine-induced toxicity and its prevention with folic acid supplementation. Male rat pups were divided into four groups including control, homocysteine (Hcy), Hcy + folic acid and folic acid groups. The Hcy group received Hcy 0.3-0.6 µmol/g body weight, while Hcy + folic acid group received folic acid orally as 0.011 µmol/g body weight along with Hcy on a postnatal day (PD) 4 until 25. The reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, GSH/GSSG ratio, protein carbonyl content, cystathionine ß synthase (CBS), and MS activities in the cerebellum were measured 25 days after birth. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), marker of lipid peroxidation were measured. Also, Bcl2, Bax, and caspase-3 expression levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Furthermore, caspase-3 protein level assay was performed by the ELISA test. Results indicated that Hcy administration could promote both lipid and protein oxidation, which was associated with increased amounts of caspase-3 mRNA and protein levels and Bax mRNA expression level in this group. Cerebellar MS, CBS enzyme activity, GSH, GSSG, and GSH/GSH ratio did not change following Hcy administration. Folic acid significantly reduced MDA level, protein carbonyl content, Bax, the caspase-3 mRNA, and protein expression levels in the cerebellum of Hcy-treated group. Moreover, cerebellar MS, CBS enzyme activity, GSH, and GSH/GSH ratio increased following folic acid treatment. We conclude that Hcy might cause apoptosis in the cerebellum. We suggest that folic acid, in addition of having antioxidant properties, can protect cerebellum against homocysteine-mediated neurotoxicity via modulating the expression of proteins that are contributed in regulation of apoptosis in the rat's cerebellum.

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is a severe form of schizophrenia. The severity of illness is positively related to homocysteine levels, with high homocysteine levels due to the low activity of the transsulfuration pathway, which metabolizes homocysteine in synthesizing L-cysteine. Glutathione levels are low in schizophrenia, which indicates shortages of L-cysteine and low activity of the transsulfuration pathway. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels are low in schizophrenia. H2S is synthesized by cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, which are the two enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway. Iron-sulfur proteins obtain sulfur from L-cysteine. The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway has various iron-sulfur proteins. With low levels of L-cysteine, iron-sulfur cluster formation will be dysregulated leading to deficits in OXPHOS in schizophrenia. Molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis requires sulfur, which is obtained from L-cysteine. With low levels of MoCo synthesis, molybdenum-dependent sulfite oxidase (SUOX) will not be synthesized at appropriate levels. SUOX detoxifies sulfite from sulfur-containing amino acids. If sulfites are not detoxified, there can be sulfite toxicity. The transsulfuration pathway metabolizes selenomethionine, whereby selenium from selenomethionine can be used for selenoprotein synthesis. The low activity of the transsulfuration pathway decreases selenoprotein synthesis. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX), with various GPXs being selenoprotein, is low in schizophrenia. The dysregulations of selenoproteins would lead to oxidant stress, which would increase the methylation of genes and histones leading to epigenetic changes in TRS. An add-on treatment to mainline antipsychotics is proposed for TRS that targets the dysregulations of the transsulfuration pathway and the dysregulations of other pathways stemming from the transsulfuration pathway being dysregulated.

In the last years tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become a leading technology used for neonatal screening purposes. Newborn screening by MS/MS on dried blood spot samples (DBS) has one of its items in methionine levels: the knowledge of this parameter allows the identification of infant affected by homocystinuria (cystathionine ß-synthase, CBS, deficiency) but can also lead, as side effect, to identify cases of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) type I/III deficiency. We started an expanded newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism in Campania region in 2007. Here we report our ten years experience on expanded newborn screening in identifying patients affected by hypermethioninemia. During this period we screened approximately 77,000 infants and identified two cases: one case of classical homocystinuria and one patient affected by defect of MAT I/III. In this paper we describe these patients and their biochemical follow-up and review the literature concerning worldwide newborn screening reports on incidence of CBS and MAT deficiency.

Homocysteine-Methionine (HM) cycle produces universal methyl group donor S-adenosylmethione (SAM), methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and homocysteine (Hcy). Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is established as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other degenerative disease. We selected 115 genes in the extended HM cycle (31 metabolic enzymes and 84 methyltransferases), examined their protein subcellular location/partner protein, investigated their mRNA levels and mapped their corresponding histone methylation status in 35 disease conditions via mining a set of public databases and intensive literature research. We have 6 major findings. 1) All HM metabolic enzymes are located only in the cytosol except for cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), which was identified in both cytosol and nucleus. 2) Eight disease conditions encountered only histone hypomethylation on 8 histone residues (H3R2/K4/R8/K9/K27/K36/K79 and H4R3). Nine disease conditions had only histone hypermethylation on 8 histone residues (H3R2/K4/K9/K27/K36/K79 and H4R3/K20). 3) We classified 9 disease types with differential HM cycle expression pattern. Eleven disease conditions presented most 4 HM cycle pathway suppression. 4) Three disease conditions had all 4 HM cycle pathway suppression and only histone hypomethylation on H3R2/K4/R8/K9/K36 and H4R3. 5) Eleven HM cycle metabolic enzymes interact with 955 proteins. 6) Five paired HM cycle proteins interact with each other. We conclude that HM cycle is a key metabolic sensor system which mediates receptor-independent metabolism-associated danger signal recognition and modulates SAM/SAH-dependent methylation in disease conditions and that hypomethylation on frequently modified histone residues is a key mechanism for metabolic disorders, autoimmune disease and CVD. We propose that HM metabolism takes place in the cytosol, that nuclear methylation equilibration requires a nuclear-cytosol transfer of SAM/SAH/Hcy, and that Hcy clearance is essential for genetic protection.

Both betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) are major enzymes in the metabolism of plasma homocysteine (Hcy). Abnormal methylation levels of BHMT and CBS are positively associated with Hcy levels. The present study is performed to explore the association between the methylation levels in the promoter regions of the BHMT and CBS genes and the efficacy of folic acid therapy in patient with hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). A prospective cohort study recruiting HHcy (Hcy<U+2009>=<U+2009>15<U+2009>µmol/L) patients was performed. The subjects were treated with oral folic acid (5<U+2009>mg/d) for 90 days, and the patients were divided into the success group (Hcy<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>15<U+2009>µmol/L) and the failure group (Hcy<U+2009>=<U+2009>15<U+2009>µmol/L) according to their Hcy levels after treatment. In the logistic regression model with adjusted covariates, the patients with lower total methylation levels in the BHMT and CBS promoter regions exhibited 1.627-fold and 1.671-fold increased risk of treatment failure compared with higher methylation individuals, respectively. Similarly, subjects who had lower methylation levels (&lt;methylation mean) in BHMT CpG1 had 1.792 times higher risks. Stratified analysis by sex found that lower CBS methylation levels were associated with a 2.128-fold increased risk for treatment failure in males with HHcy. Lower levels of BHMT or CBS promoter total methylation might be associated with increased the risk of treatment failure. These studies suggest that lower levels of BHMT and CBS methylation are all predictors of failure in folic acid therapy for HHcy. However, due to some limitations of this study, such as the small number of the loci tested, further large-scale studies are necessary to verify our observations.

Hydrogen sulfide is an antioxidant molecule that has a wide range of biological effects against oxidative stress. Balanced oxidative stress is also vital for maintaining cellular function in biological system, where reactive oxygen species are the main source of oxidative stress. When the normal redox balance is disturbed, deoxyribonucleic acid, lipid, and protein molecules are oxidized under pathological conditions, like diabetes mellitus that leads to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In diabetes mellitus-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy, due to hyperglycemia, pancreatic beta cell (ß cell) shows resistance to insulin secretion. As a consequence, glucose metabolism is disturbed in neuronal cells which are distracted from providing proper cell signaling pathway. Not only diabetic peripheral neuropathy but also other central damages occur in brain neuropathy. Neurological studies regarding type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have shown changes in the central nervous system because high blood glucose levels (HbA1c) appeared with poor cognitive function. Oxidative stress plays a role in inhibiting insulin signaling that is necessary for brain function. Hydrogen sulfide exhibits antioxidant effects against oxidative stress, where cystathionine ß synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase are the endogenous sources of hydrogen sulfide. This review is to explore the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy and other neurological comorbid disorders under the oxidative stress condition and the anti-oxidative effects of hydrogen sulfide.

The reduced iron usage induced by the suppression of erythropoiesis is a major cause of the systemic iron overload in CBS knockout (CBS<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. However, the relevant mechanisms are unknown. Here, we examined changes in granulocyte/erythroid cell ratios, iron content, and expression of iron-metabolism proteins, including; two key enzymes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway, ALAS2 (delta-aminolevulinate synthase 2) and FECH (ferrochelatase), a heme exporter from the cytosol and mitochondria, FLVCR (feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor) as well as EPO (erythropoietin), EPOR (erythropoietin receptor) and HIF-2a (hypoxia inducible factor-2 subunit a), in the blood, bone marrow or liver of CBS<sup>-/-</sup> (homozygous), CBS<sup>+/-</sup> (heterozygous) and CBS<sup>+/+</sup> (Wild Type) mice. Our findings demonstrate that CBS deficiency can induce a significant reduction in the expression of ALAS2, FECH, FLVCR, HIF-2a, EPO, and EPOR as well as an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6), hepcidin and iron content in the blood, bone marrow or liver of mice. We conclude that the suppression of erythropoiesis is mainly due to the CBS deficiency-induced disruption in the expression of heme biosynthetic enzymes and heme-transporter.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process of the pancreatic gland that may lead to dysregulation of the trans-sulfuration pathway. The aims of this work were firstly to study the methionine cycle as well as the trans-sulfuration pathway using metabolomic and proteomic approaches identifying the causes of this dysregulation in an experimental model of acute pancreatitis; and secondly to reveal the effects of S-adenosylmethionine administration on these pathways. Acute pancreatitis was induced by cerulein in mice, and a group of animals received S-adenosylmethionine treatment. Cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis rapidly caused marked depletion of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, cystathionine, cysteine, and glutathione levels in pancreas, but S-adenosylhomocysteine and homocysteine remained unchanged. Protein steady-state levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine-hydrolase and cystathionine gamma-lyase diminished but methylthioadenosine phosphorylase levels increased in pancreas with acute pancreatitis. Although cystathionine ß-synthase protein levels did not change with acute pancreatitis, Nos2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly up-regulated and caused tyrosine nitration of cystathionine ß-synthase in pancreas. S-adenosylmethionine administration enhanced Nos2 mRNA expression and cystathionine ß-synthase nitration and triggered homocysteine accumulation in acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, S-adenosylmethionine administration promoted enrichment of the euchromatin marker H3K4me3 in the promoters of Tnf-a, Il-6, and Nos2 and enhanced the mRNA up-regulation of these genes. Accordingly, S-adenosylmethionine administration increased inflammatory infiltrate and edema in pancreas with acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, tyrosine-nitration of cystathionine ß-synthase blockades the trans-sulfuration pathway in acute pancreatitis promoting homocysteine accumulation upon S-adenosylmethionine treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Both genetics and environmental factors play a role in the occurrence of non-syndromic cleft lip/palate (NSCL/P). This meta-analysis evaluated the association between cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) c.844ins68 polymorphism and risk of NSCL/P in family-based and case-control studies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles published until September 2018. RevMan 5.3 software was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for the association between CBS c.844ins68 polymorphism and risk of NSCL/P by using five genetic models in the studies. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was conducted for family-based studies.RESULTS: Three case-control and three family-based studies were evaluated. Based on the analysis of five genetic models, risk of NSCL/P was not related to CBS c.844ins68 polymorphism in case-control studies. The results of family-based studies did not show any association between the CBS c.844ins68 allele and NSCL/P either.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis showed that there was no association between CBS c.844ins68 polymorphism and risk of NSCL/P; therefore, this polymorphism does not play a role in susceptibility to NSCL/P.

Unless there is a genetic defect/mutation/deletion in a gene, the causation of a given disease is chronic dysregulation of gut metabolism. Most of the time, if not always, starts within the gut; that is what we eat. Recent research shows that the imbalance between good versus bad microbial population, especially in the gut, causes systemic diseases. Thus, an appropriate balance of the gut microbiota (eubiosis over dysbiosis) needs to be maintained for normal health (Veeranki and Tyagi, 2017, Journal of Cellular Physiology, 232, 2929-2930). However, during various diseases such as metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension the dysbiotic gut environment tends to prevail. Our research focuses on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism that occupies a center-stage in many biochemically relevant epigenetic mechanisms. For example, dysbiotic bacteria methylate promoters to inhibit gene activities. Interestingly, the product of the 1-carbon metabolism is Hcy, unequivocally. Emerging studies show that host resistance to various antibiotics occurs due to inverton promoter inhibition, presumably because of promoter methylation. This results from modification of host promoters by bacterial products leading to loss of host's ability to drug compatibility and system sensitivity. In this study, we focus on the role of high methionine diet (HMD), an ingredient rich in red meat and measure the effects of a probiotic on cardiac muscle remodeling and its functions. We employed wild type (WT) and cystathionine beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS<sup>+/-</sup> ) mice with and without HMD and with and without a probiotic; PB (Lactobacillus) in drinking water for 16 weeks. Results indicate that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity was robust in CBS<sup>+/-</sup> fed with HMD and that it was successfully attenuated by the PB treatment. Cardiomyocyte contractility and ECHO data revealed mitigation of the cardiac dysfunction in CBS<sup>+/-</sup> <U+2009>+<U+2009>HMD mice treated with PB. In conclusion, our data suggest that probiotics can potentially reverse the Hcy-meditated cardiac dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) are related disorders of mitochondrial propionate metabolism, caused by defects in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) and propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), respectively. These biochemical defects lead to a complex cascade of downstream metabolic abnormalities, and identification of these abnormal pathways has important implications for understanding disease pathophysiology. Using a multi-omics approach in cellular models of MMA and PA, we identified serine and thiol metabolism as important areas of metabolic dysregulation.CONCLUSION: We identified abnormal serine metabolism as a novel area of cellular dysfunction in MMA and PA, thus introducing a potential new target for therapeutic investigation.

Mental retardation is a progressive condition in Down syndrome: intelligence starts to decline linearly within the first year. This phenomenon could be related to the overproduction of a toxic compound, hydrogen sulfide. Indeed, a gene located on chromosome 21 controls the production of cystathionine-ß-synthase, an enzyme involved in hydrogen sulfide production in the central nervous system. It has recently been demonstrated that excess cystathionine-ß-synthase levels are needed and sufficient to induce cognitive phenotypes in mouse models of Down syndrome. Thus, two therapeutic options might be used in Down syndrome patients: the use of a specific cystathionine ß-synthase inhibitor and the use of an effective antidote to reduce hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Prenatal treatment of Down syndrome fetuses is also suggested.

Degeneration of apical spikelets and reduced panicle fertility are common reasons for low seed-setting rate in rice (Oryza sativa). However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we report a novel degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (dps1) mutant that showed panicle apical degeneration and reduced fertility in middle spikelets. dps1 plants were characterized by small whitish anthers with altered cuticle morphology and absence of pollen grains. Amounts of cuticular wax and cutin were significantly reduced in dps1 anthers. Panicles of dps1 plants showed an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower antioxidant activity, and increased programmed cell death. Map-based cloning revealed that DPS1 encodes a mitochondrial-localized protein containing a cystathionine ß-synthase domain that showed the highest expression in panicles and anthers. DPS1 physically interacted with mitochondrial thioredoxin proteins Trx1 and Trx20, and it participated in ROS scavenging. Global gene expression analysis in dps1 revealed that biological processes related to fatty acid metabolism and ROS homeostasis were significantly affected, and the expression of key genes involved in wax and cutin biosynthesis were downregulated. These results suggest that DPS1 plays a vital role in regulating ROS homeostasis, anther cuticle formation, and panicle development in rice.

The dysregulation of pulmonary arterial vasoactive mediators or excessive proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) might result in contraction or remodeling of pulmonary blood vessels, leading to related lung diseases. Recent studies suggest that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous vasodilator generated in the blood vessels by the enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), could induce the vasodilation, thus improving contraction or remodeling-induced lung diseases. In this study, we hypothesized that PASMCs could produce H2S and relax the pulmonary artery, and its mechanism is related to CSE, CBS, and TRPV4 channels by affecting both the excessive proliferation and pulmonary vasoconstriction in PASMCs. We found that the sildenafil treatment could remarkably promote H2S production and control the proliferation in PASMCs; meanwhile, the protein levels of CSE and CBS and the intracellular concentration of calcium could also be increased by sildenafil. Moreover, the effects of sildenafil could be reversed by a CBS inhibitor or a CSE inhibitor, indicating that sildenafil could affect CSE and CBS to modulate the production of H2S and the proliferation in rat PASMCs. Together, we demonstrated a new mechanism for sildenafil to modulate the synthesis of H2S and cell proliferation in PASMCs by affecting CSE and CBS. TRPV4-dependent Ca events and BMP4 may also be involved.

Bacterial family II pyrophosphatases (PPases) are homodimeric enzymes, with the active site located between two catalytic domains. Some family II PPases additionally contain regulatory cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains and exhibit positive kinetic cooperativity, which is lost upon CBS domain removal. We report here that CBS domain-deficient family II PPases of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus gordonii also exhibit positive kinetic cooperativity, manifested as an up to a five-fold difference in the Michaelis constants for two active sites. An Asn79Ser replacement in S. gordonii PPase preserved its dimeric structure but abolished cooperativity. The results of our study indicated that kinetic cooperativity is an inherent property of all family II PPase types, is not induced by CBS domains, and is sensitive to minor structural changes. These findings may have inferences for other CBS-proteins, which include important enzymes and membrane transporters associated with hereditary diseases.

BACKGROUND: Jalili syndrome (JS) is a rare cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). The first clinical presentation of JS patients was published in 1988 by Jalili and Smith. Pathogenic mutations in the Cyclin and CBS Domain Divalent Metal Cation Transport Mediator 4 (CNNM4) magnesium transporter protein have been reported as the leading cause of this anomaly.METHODS: In the present study, a clinical and genetic investigation was performed in a consanguineous family of Pakistani origin, showing characteristic features of JS. Sanger sequencing was successfully used to identify the causative variant in CNNM4. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the effect of amino acid change over CNNM4 protein.RESULTS: Sequence analysis of CNNM4 revealed a novel missense variant (c.1220G&gt;T, p.Arg407Leu) in exon-1 encoding cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domain. To comprehend the mutational consequences in the structure, the mutant p.Arg407Leu was modeled together with a previously reported variant (c.1484C&gt;T, p.Thr495Ile) in the same domain. Additionally, docking analysis deciphered the binding mode of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cofactor. Furthermore, 60ns MD simulations were carried out on wild type (p.Arg407/p.Thr495) and mutants (p.Arg407Leu/p.Thr495Ile) to understand the structural and energetic changes in protein structure and its dynamic behavior. An evident conformational shift of ATP in the binding site was observed in simulated mutants disrupting the native ATP-binding mode.CONCLUSION: The novel identified variant in CNNM4 is the first report from the Pakistani population. Overall, the study is valuable and may give a novel insight into metal transport in visual function and biomineralization.

Accurate prediction of the impact of genomic variation on phenotype is a major goal of computational biology and an important contributor to personalized medicine. Computational predictions can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying genetic diseases, including cancer, but their adoption requires thorough and unbiased assessment. Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, from homocysteine to cystathionine, and in which variations are associated with human hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. We have created a computational challenge under the CAGI framework to evaluate how well different methods can predict the phenotypic effect(s) of CBS single amino acid substitutions using a blinded experimental data set. CAGI participants were asked to predict yeast growth based on the identity of the mutations. The performance of the methods was evaluated using several metrics. The CBS challenge highlighted the difficulty of predicting the phenotype of an ex vivo system in a model organism when classification models were trained on human disease data. We also discuss the variations in difficulty of prediction for known benign and deleterious variants, as well as identify methodological and experimental constraints with lessons to be learned for future challenges.

Epidemiological data suggest an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). AD is anatomically associated with an early progressive accumulation of Aß leading to a gradual Tau hyperphosphorylation, which constitute the main characteristics of damaged brain in AD. Apart from these processes, mounting evidence suggests that specific features of diabetes, namely impaired glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in the brain, play a key role in AD. Moreover, several studies report a potential role of Aß and Tau in peripheral tissues such as pancreatic ß cells. Thus, it appears that several biological pathways associated with diabetes overlap with AD. The link between peripheral insulin resistance and brain insulin resistance with concomitant cognitive impairment may also potentially be mediated by a liver/pancreatic/brain axis, through the excessive trafficking of neurotoxic molecules across the blood-brain barrier. Insulin resistance incites inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine activation modulates the homocysteine cycle in T2D patients. Elevated plasma homocysteine level is a risk factor for AD pathology and is also closely associated with metabolic syndrome. We previously demonstrated a strong association between homocysteine metabolism and insulin via cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) activity, the enzyme implicated in the first step of the trans-sulfuration pathway, in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a spontaneous model of T2D, with close similarities with human T2D. CBS activity is also correlated with DYRK1A, a serine/threonine kinase regulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and Tau phosphorylation, which are implicated in a wide range of disease such as T2D and AD. We hypothesized that DYRK1A, BDNF, and Tau, could be among molecular factors linking T2D to AD. In this focused review, we briefly examine the main mechanisms linking AD to T2D and provide the first evidence that certain circulating AD biomarkers are found in diabetic GK rats. We propose that the spontaneous model of T2D in GK rat could be a suitable model to investigate molecular mechanisms linking T2D to AD.

OBJECTIVES: Presymptomatic detection of patients with rare diseases (RD), defined by a population frequency less than 1 : 2,000, is the task of newborn screening (NBS). In the Czech Republic (CZ), currently eighteen RD are screened: phenylketonuria/hyperphenylalaninemia (PKU/HPA), congenital hypothyroidism (CH), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), cystic fibrosis (CF), medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD), very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD), carnitine palmitoyl transferase I and II deficiency (CPTID, CPTIID), carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), glutaric aciduria type I (GA I), isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IVA), argininemia (ARG), citrullinemia (CIT), biotinidase deficiency (BTD), cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient homocystinuria (CBSD HCU), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency homocystinuria (MTHFRD HCU). The aim was to analyze the prevalence of RD screened by NBS in CZ.METHODS: We examined the NBS programme in CZ from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017, which covered 888,891 neonates. Dried blood spots were primarily analyzed using fluorescence immuno-assay, tandem mass spectrometry and fluorimetry.RESULTS: The overall prevalence of RD among the neonate cohort was 1 : 1,043. Individually, 1 : 2,877 for CH, 1 : 5,521 for PKU/HPA, 1 : 6,536 for CF (1 : 5,887 including false negative patients), 1 : 12,520 for CAH, 1 : 22,222 for MCADD, 1 : 80,808 for LCHADD, 1 : 177,778 for GA I, 1 : 177,778 for IVA, 1 : 222,223 for VLCADD, 1 : 296,297 for MSUD, 1 : 8,638 for BTD, and 1 : 181,396 for CBSD HCU.CONCLUSIONS: The observed prevalence of RD, based on NBS, corresponds to that expected, more precisely it was higher for BTD and lower for MSUD, IVA, CBSD HCU, MCADD and VLCADD. Early detection of rare diseases by means of NBS is an effective secondary prevention tool.

Classical homocystinuria is a recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. The highest incidence of CBS deficiency in the world is found in the country of Qatar due to the combination of high rates of consanguinity and the presence of a founder mutation, c.1006C&gt;T (p.R336C). This mutation does not respond to pyridoxine and is considered severe. Here we describe the creation of a mouse that is null for the mouse Cbs gene and expresses human p.R336C CBS from a zinc-inducible transgene (Tg-R336C Cbs <sup>-/-</sup> ). Zinc-treated Tg-R336C Cbs <sup>-/-</sup> mice have extreme elevation in both serum total homocysteine (tHcy) and liver tHcy compared with control transgenic mice. Both the steady-state protein levels and CBS enzyme activity levels in liver lysates from Tg-R336C Cbs <sup>-/-</sup> mice are significantly reduced compared to that found in Tg-hCBS Cbs <sup>-/-</sup> mice expressing wild-type human CBS. Treatment of Tg-R336C Cbs <sup>-/-</sup> mice with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib results in stabilization of liver CBS protein and an increase in activity to levels found in corresponding Tg-hCBS Cbs <sup>-/-</sup> wild type mice. Surprisingly, serum tHcy did not fully correct even though liver enzyme activity was as high as control animals. This discrepancy is explained by in vitro enzymatic studies of mouse liver extracts showing that p.R336C causes reduced binding affinity for the substrate serine by almost 7-fold and significantly increased dependence on pyridoxal phosphate in the reaction buffer. These studies demonstrate that the p.R336C alteration effects both protein stability and substrate/cofactor binding.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata (RRP) is a popular medicinal herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat CVDs. However, the development of this novel therapeutic product has been stagnant, and its molecular mechanism of action remains unclear. This study aims to explore the effective ingredients of RRP against CVDs, especially atherosclerosis (AS). Using the AutoDock Vina software, the RRP's ingredients were docked with the targets which can be collected by RCSB and UniProt. Then the screened ingredients and targets could be used to dispose the pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We used GEO, GCBI and DAVID databases to analyze the microarray data of AS which could be used to verify the results of molecular docking, all of which could show the molecular mechanism of RRP on CVDs. We also constructed a compound-target interaction network of CVD with 85 nodes and 272 edges on the basis of molecular docking analysis through Cytoscape. The network showed that forsythiaside, acteoside and stigmasterol are the most important compounds and 2HRR (ACAT (Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl transferase) protein), 4ATB (MMP13) and 1JBQ (cystathionine beta-synthase) are the most valuable targets in the action of RRP against CVD. We also examined the biological functions involved in the biological process, molecular function and cellular components. In accordance with the analysis of GSE6054 microarray data of AS disease, the 20 most specifically expressed genes (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) and the top 10 pathways of DEGs were discovered. Five key pathways, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway were also explored. Amongst these pathways, the top three were the pathways in cancer, MAPK signalling pathway and human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection. The pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway were found simultaneously in the pathway analysis for CVD on RRP and for AS on microarray data. This study provided a new potential herbal medicine against CVD and has increased the understanding on the molecular mechanisms of RRPmediated protection against CVD, especially AS.

Mental retardation is the most common feature among inborn errors of amino acid metabolism. Patients with homocystinuria/homocysteinemia caused by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency suffer from thromboembolism and mental retardation from early ages; therefore, detection by newborn screening is performed. Furthermore, elevated levels of serum homocysteine during pregnancy are associated with the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in newborns. However, the causes of such central nervous system (CNS) defects are unknown. We found previously impaired learning abilities in Cbs-deficient (Cbs<sup>-/-</sup>) mice (but not NTD births). Here, we investigated the amino acid profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Mice deficient in cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (Cth), a downstream enzyme of CBS in transsulfuration, as well as wild-type mice, were analyzed as controls. Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> and Cth<sup>-/-</sup> mice were smaller than wild-type mice, and CSF yields in Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mice were lower than the others. CSF amino acid levels were generally lower than those in serum, and compared with the dramatic amino acid level alterations in Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mouse serum, alterations in CSF were less apparent. However, marked upregulation (versus wild-type) of aspartic acid/asparagine (Asp/Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), total homocysteine, and citrulline, and downregulation of lysine (Lys) were found in Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mouse CSF. Because similar regulation of total homocysteine/citrulline/Lys was observed in the CSF of Cth<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which are free of CNS dysfunction, the reduced CSF volumes and the level changes of other amino acids could be relevant to Cbs<sup>-/-</sup>-specific CNS defects.

Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway where cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a rate-limiting enzyme. Homocysteine is thought to play a role in bone remodelling and strength. Previous results indicated that some of the difference in bone strength of end-of-lay hens may be associated with CBS expression level. To investigate if differences in the promoter region of the CBS gene might be responsible for observed differences in gene expression between CBS alleles post mortem- and in-vitro expression studies have been undertaken. Transfection of the DF-1 avian cell line with a series of deletion fragments of the 5' promoter, or constructs containing three CBS allele sequences, with a luciferase reporter revealed that a core region of -155 to +131<U+202F>bp in the CBS promoter was essential for mRNA expression. We found that a variable number of short tandem repeats (7 nucleotide motif and 6 nucleotide repeats) in the core region of the promoter affecting the transcriptional activity and a strong effect for gene expression. However, methylation of the 6 nucleotide repeats varied between allelic variants and these maybe responsible for differences in promoter activity. Our findings indicated variable short tandem repeats and the differentially methylated sites in the promoter region may be responsible for CBS expression differences in the bone of laying hens.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of methionine on the activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase.METHODS: A total of 56 male rats of the Wistar were randomly divided into 7 groups: 10% casein(10 C) group, 40% casein(40 C) group, 10 C+0.75% L-methionine(10 CM) group, 10 C+amino acid mixture(10 CAA) group, 10 CAA-methionine(10 CAA-Met) group, 10 C+ essential amino acid(10 C+EAA) group, and 10 C+ non-essential amino acid(10 C+NEAA) group, with 8 rats in each group for 10 days.RESULTS: The plasma homocysteine concentration significantly increased from(17.1±0.3)µmol/L to(50.7±4.8)µmol/L and(40.5±3.9)µmol/L in rats fed 10 CM and 10 C+EAA diets(P&lt;0.01). Supplementation with methionine induced hyperhomocysteinemia. Compared to 10 C, the activity of hepatic cystathionine-ß-synthase(CBS) were significantly increased in the experimental group except for 10 CM(P&lt;0.05). The activity of hepatic CBS was the largest increases in diets with 40 C and the smallest increases in 10 C+NEAA. The activity of hepatic betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase(BHMT) were increased in the experimental group except for 10 CAA-Met and 10 C+NEAA(P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The increased CBS activity induced by high protein diets is determined by high amino acid intake rather than methionine supplemention.

O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) are members of the PLP-II family, and involved in L-cysteine production. OASS produces L-cysteine via a de novo pathway while CBS participates in the reverse transsulfuration pathway. O-acetylserine-dependent CBS (OCBS) was previously identified as a new member of the PLP-II family, which are predominantly seen in bacteria. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori possess only one OASS (hp0107) gene and we showed that the protein coded by this gene actually functions as an OCBS and utilizes L-homocysteine and O-acetylserine (OAS) to produce cystathionine. HpOCBS did not show CBS activity with the substrate L-serine and required OAS exclusively. The HpOCBS structure in complex with methionine showed a closed cleft state, explaining the initial mode of substrate binding. Sequence and structural analyses showed differences between the active sites of OCBS and CBS, and explain their different substrate preferences. We identified three hydrophobic residues near the active site of OCBS, corresponding to one serine and two tyrosine residues in CBSs. Mutational studies were performed on HpOCBS and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CBS. A ScCBS double mutant (Y158F/Y226V) did not display activity with L-serine, indicating indispensability of these polar residues for selecting substrate L-serine, however, did show activity with OAS.

Endogenous gaseous transmitters (nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulphide) form a special neuromodulation system mediating the development and modification of nerve centers. Here, we examined the localization of key gaseous transmitter enzymes: cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2), and constitutive NO synthase (nNOS) in the fetal human retina at different stages of development. The number of CBS- and CSE-positive photoreceptors and intermediate retinal neurons was high in trimester I and gradually decreased to the end of trimester III. The number of HO-2-positive cells followed the same trend. The number of nNOS-positive intermediate retinal neurons and neurons within the ganglion cell layer showed the opposite dynamics with the peak in trimester III. The results are interpreted in terms of the role of gaseous transmitters in retinogenesis and cytoprotection.

BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Whole eggs contain several nutrients known to affect homocysteine regulation, including sulfur amino acids, choline, and B vitamins.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of whole eggs and egg components (i.e., egg protein and choline) with respect to 1) homocysteine balance and 2) the hepatic expression and activity of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) in a folate-restricted (FR) rat model of hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 48; 6 wk of age) were randomly assigned to a casein-based diet (C; n = 12), a casein-based diet supplemented with choline (C + Cho; 1.3%, wt:wt; n = 12), an egg protein-based diet (EP; n = 12), or a whole egg-based diet (WE; n = 12). At week 2, half of the rats in each of the 4 dietary groups were provided an FR (0 g folic acid/kg) diet and half continued on the folate-sufficient (FS; 0.2 g folic acid/kg) diet for an additional 6 wk. All diets contained 20% (wt:wt) total protein. Serum homocysteine was measured by HPLC and BHMT and CBS expression and activity were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and enzyme activity. A 2-factor ANOVA was used for statistical comparisons.RESULTS: Rats fed FR-C exhibited a 53% increase in circulating homocysteine concentrations compared with rats fed FS-C (P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, serum homocysteine did not differ between rats fed FS-C and FR-EP (P = 0.078). Hepatic BHMT activity was increased by 45% and 40% by the EP (P &lt; 0.001) and WE (P = 0.002) diets compared with the C diets, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intervention with egg protein prevented elevated circulating homocysteine concentrations in a rat model of hyperhomocysteinemia, due in part to upregulation of hepatic BHMT. These data may support the inclusion of egg protein for dietary recommendations targeting hyperhomocysteinemia prevention.

BACKGROUND: Regulatory cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains are ubiquitous in proteins, yet their mechanism of regulation remains largely obscure. Inorganic pyrophosphatase which contains regulatory CBS domains as internal inhibitors (CBS-PPase) is activated by ATP and inhibited by AMP and ADP; nucleotide binding to CBS domains and substrate binding to catalytic domains demonstrate positive co-operativity.METHODS: Here, we explore the ability of an AMP analogue (cAMP) and four compounds that mimic the constituent parts of the AMP molecule (adenine, adenosine, phosphate, and fructose-1-phosphate) to bind and alter the activity of CBS-PPase from the bacterium Desulfitobacterium hafniense.RESULTS: Adenine, adenosine and cAMP activated CBS-PPase several-fold whereas fructose-1-phosphate inhibited it. Adenine and adenosine binding to dimeric CBS-PPase exhibited high positive co-operativity and markedly increased substrate binding co-operativity. Phosphate bound to CBS-PPase competitively with respect to a fluorescent AMP analogue.CONCLUSIONS: Protein interactions with the adenine moiety of AMP induce partial release of the internal inhibition and determine nucleotide-binding co-operativity, whereas interactions with the phosphate group potentiate the internal inhibition and decrease active-site co-operativity. The ribose moiety appears to enhance the activation effect of adenine and suppress its contribution to both types of co-operativity.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that regulation of a CBS-protein (inhibition or activation) is determined by a balance of its interactions with different chemical groups of the nucleotide and can be reversed by their modification. Differential regulation by nucleotides is not uncommon among CBS-proteins, and our findings may thus have a wider significance.

BACKGROUND: Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap (ACO) has frequent exacerbations and a poor quality of life and prognosis compared with those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alone. However, the pathogenesis of ACO has not been fully elucidated yet.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate nitrosative stress, which causes a redox imbalance and tissue inflammation in the airways of patients with ACO, and to evaluate the relationship between nitrosative stress and the clinical course in study subjects.METHODS: Thirty healthy subjects and 56 asthmatic patients participated in this study. The asthmatic patients were divided into 33 asthmatic patients and 23 patients with ACO. The study subjects had been followed prospectively for 2 years to evaluate the clinical course. Nitrosative stress was evaluated based on the production of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) in sputum cells.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that greater nitrosative stress occurred in the airways of patients with ACO, and the degree of nitrosative stress was correlated with an impairment in the clinical course. Nitrosative stress might be related to the pathogenesis of ACO.

Although choline requirements for cows are unknown, enhanced postruminal supply may decrease liver triacylglycerol and increase flux through the Met cycle to improve immunometabolic status during a negative nutrient balance (NNB). Our objectives were to investigate the effects of postruminal choline supply during a feed restriction-induced NNB on (1) hepatic activity cystathionine ß-synthase and transcription of enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway and Met cycle; (2) hepatic metabolites in the Met cycle and the transsulfuration pathway, bile acids, and energy metabolism; and 3) plasma biomarkers of liver function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Ten primiparous rumen-cannulated Holstein cows (158 ± 24 d postpartum) were used in a replicated 5 × 5 Latin square design with 4-d treatment periods and 10 d of recovery (14 d/period). Treatments were unrestricted intake with abomasal infusion of water, restricted intake (R; 60% of net energy for lactation requirements) with abomasal infusion of water, or R plus abomasal infusion of 6.25, 12.5, or 25 g/d choline ion. Liver tissue was collected on d 5 after infusions ended, and blood was collected on d 1, 3, and 5. Statistical contrasts were A0 versus R0 (CONT1), R versus the average of choline doses (CONT2), and tests of linear and quadratic effects of choline dose. Activity of cystathionine ß-synthase was lower with R (CONT1) and decreased linearly with choline. Hepatic glutathione was not different with R or choline, but taurine tended to be greater with choline (CONT2). Betaine and carnitine were greater with R (CONT1) and further increased with choline (CONT2). Concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> were greater with choline (CONT2). Cholic and glycol-chenodeoxycholic acids were decreased by R and choline, while taurocholic and tauro-chenodeoxycholic acids were not altered. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin were greater with R (CONT1) but decreased with choline (CONT2). Paraoxonase was lower with R and increased with choline (CONT2). Data suggest that enhanced supply of choline during NNB decreases entry of homocysteine to the transsulfuration pathway, potentially favoring remethylation to Met by acquiring a methyl group from betaine. As such, Met may provide methyl groups for synthesis of carnitine. Along with production data indicating that 12.5 g/d choline ion improved milk yield and liver fatty acid metabolism during NNB, the changes in blood biomarkers also suggest a beneficial effect of choline supply on liver function and oxidative stress.

ClC-1 protein channels facilitate rapid passage of chloride ions across cellular membranes, thereby orchestrating skeletal muscle excitability. Malfunction of ClC-1 is associated with myotonia congenita, a disease impairing muscle relaxation. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human ClC-1, uncovering an architecture reminiscent of that of bovine ClC-K and CLC transporters. The chloride conducting pathway exhibits distinct features, including a central glutamate residue (&quot;fast gate&quot;) known to confer voltage-dependence (a mechanistic feature not present in ClC-K), linked to a somewhat rearranged central tyrosine and a narrower aperture of the pore toward the extracellular vestibule. These characteristics agree with the lower chloride flux of ClC-1 compared with ClC-K and enable us to propose a model for chloride passage in voltage-dependent CLC channels. Comparison of structures derived from protein studied in different experimental conditions supports the notion that pH and adenine nucleotides regulate ClC-1 through interactions between the so-called cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domains and the intracellular vestibule (&quot;slow gating&quot;). The structure also provides a framework for analysis of mutations causing myotonia congenita and reveals a striking correlation between mutated residues and the phenotypic effect on voltage gating, opening avenues for rational design of therapies against ClC-1-related diseases.

Metabolic homeostasis of amino acids is essential for human health. Here, we aimed to investigate a potential role for the clock component reverse erythroblastosis virus a (Rev-erba) in circadian regulation of amino acid metabolism. RNA-seq with Rev-erba<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed expression changes in genes involved in amino acid metabolism, particularly, the urea cycle and methionine metabolism. Rev-erba ablation increased hepatic mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (Bhmt), cystathionine ß-synthase (Cbs), and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (Cth) and decreased the levels of plasma and liver homocysteine in mice. Cell-based assays confirmed negative regulation of these three genes by Rev-erba. Combined luciferase reporter, mobility-shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified Rev-erba as a transcriptional repressor of Bhmt, Cbs, and Cth. Rev-erba ablation or antagonism alleviated chemical-induced hyperhomocysteinemia in mice. This was accompanied by elevated expressions of Bhmt, Cbs, and Cth. Moreover, Rev-erba ablation or antagonism promoted urea production and ammonia clearance. Of urea cycle-related genes, arginase 1 (Arg1), ornithine transcarbamylase (Otc), and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (Cps1) expressions were up-regulated in Rev-erba<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Negative regulation of these urea cycle genes by Rev-erba was validated using cell-based experiments. Mechanistic studies revealed that Rev-erba inhibited CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein a transactivation to repress the transcription of Arg1, Cps1, and Otc. Conclusion: Rev-erba antagonism alleviates hyperhomocysteinemia and promotes ammonia clearance. Targeting Rev-erba represents an approach for the management of homocysteine- and ammonia-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: Methionine is an essential sulfur-containing amino acid. To elucidate the influence of l-methionine on activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2-ARE) antioxidant pathway to stimulate the endogenous antioxidant activity for depressing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-derived oxidative stress, male Wistar rats were orally administered l-methionine daily for 14<U+2009>days.RESULTS: With the intake of l-methionine, Nrf2 was activated by l-methionine through depressing Keap1 and Cul3, resulting in upregulation of ARE-driven antioxidant expression (glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, glutamate cysteine ligase modulatory subunit, glutathione synthase (GS), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), heme oxygenase 1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) with increasing l-methionine availability. Upon activation of Nrf2, glutathione synthesis was increased through upregulated expression of methionine adenosyltransferase, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyse, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and GS, while hepatic expressions of methionine sulfoxide reductases (MsrA, MsrB2, MsrB3) and hepatic enzyme activities (CAT, SOD, GCL, GR, GST, GPx) were uniformly stimulated with increasing consumption of l-methionine. As a result, hepatic content of ROS and MDA were effectively reduced by l-methionine intake.CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that methionine availability plays a critical role in activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway to induce an endogenous antioxidant response for depressing ROS-derived oxidative stress, which is primarily attributed to the stimulation of methionine sulfoxide reductase expression and glutathione synthesis. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

Enhancing the supply of rumen-protected Met (RPM) during the peripartum period alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress status in dairy cows. We tested the hypothesis that RPM could increase abundance of genes and proteins related to glutathione (GSH) metabolism and the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Multiparous Holstein cows were fed a basal diet [control prepartum diet = 1.47 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM) and 15.3% crude protein; control postpartum diet = 1.67 Mcal/kg of DM and 17.7% crude protein] or the control plus ethyl-cellulose RPM at a rate of 0.09 and 0.10% of DM intake before expected calving and after calving, respectively. Sixty cows were assigned to treatments based on parity, previous 305-d milk yield, and body condition score at 28 d from parturition. Diets were fed from -28 to 30 d. Biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue collected on d -10, 10, and 30 relative to parturition from 7 cows in each group were used for measuring concentrations of GSH, reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and mRNA and protein abundance (Western blotting). A repeated-measures ANOVA was used for statistics. The statistical model included the random effect of block and fixed effects of treatment, time, and its interaction. There was a diet × time effect for reactive oxygen species due to lower concentrations in Met versus control cows specifically at d -10. Cows fed Met also had lower concentrations of malondialdehyde in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Compared with controls, overall mRNA abundance of the GSH metabolism-related genes cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), glutathione reductase (GSR), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) was greater in cows fed Met. Furthermore, supply of Met resulted in an overall upregulation of protein abundance of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 1, GPX3, glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1), and glutathione S-transferase a 4 (GSTA4), all related to GSH metabolism. There was a diet × time effect for protein abundance of NFE2L2 and its repressor Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1) due to lower values at 30 d in cows fed Met versus controls. The abundance of phosphorylated NFE2L2 was lower at 30 d in response to Met. Overall, the data suggest that exogenous Met may play a role in activating GSH metabolism and the antioxidant NFE2L2 pathways in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

The dietary requirement for cysteine is not determined in poultry since it is not an essential amino acid. The cysteine need is expected to be met through the transsulfuration pathway where homocysteine, a precursor of methionine, is converted to cysteine. Cysteine is a major component of plumage, and the degree to which cysteine is involved in plumage and other keratized proteins are unknown. We randomly assigned chicks to control and treatment (deficient in cysteine) diets for 49<U+2009>d. The thickness of the skin layers, feather follicle length, and thickness were measured at days 10, 24, 34, and 49. We also measured the hepatic mRNA expressions of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTL), cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), and glutathione synthetase (GSS). Chickens fed the treatment diet had reduced epidermis thickness and shorter feather follicles compared with the controls. The chicken fed the treatment diet also had increased mRNA expression of CBS and CTL indicating a disruption of the transsulfuration pathway. The treatment chickens also had a decreased hepatic CDO and increased GSS mRNA expressions which are in concordance with the homeostatic regulation of cysteine. Compromised cysteine metabolism could affect thermoregulation and subsequently affect feed efficiency and welfare of the birds.

Folate is an essential micronutrient during pregnancy. The differential expression of genes related to folate transport and metabolism during the advancing gestation and pregnancy complications is not well established. Hence, we studied the gene expression of folate metabolism and transport proteins in the placenta with advancing gestation, preeclampsia and neural tube defects (NTD). The expression of folate transporters and enzymes involved in folate metabolism in the placenta with advancing gestation and pregnancy-related disorders were studied by 2-step RT-PCR. Folate levels were estimated by microbiological assay using Lactobacillus casei. Significant changes in levels of placental folate metabolizing enzymes were found in both physiological and pathological pregnancies during advancing gestation. Expression of methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) was decreased while that of methionine synthase (MS) (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) was increased with advancing gestation. A much-reduced expression of MTHFR (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and an abnormally high expression of methionine synthase reductase (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) were observed in the NTD group. In NTDs, there was an adaptive up-regulation of folate transporters mainly reduced folate carrier (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and folate receptor alpha (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). MTHFR expression showed a strong positive correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.96, p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) with folate levels in placenta. Pregnant women with preeclampsia had low expression of MS (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) in association with low folate levels. Placental folate metabolizing enzymes exhibited a differential pattern during advancing gestation. Deficient folate status in association with alteration in expression of enzymes involved in folate metabolism might be associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and NTDs.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the expression changes of the hydrogen sulfide synthases cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), after optic nerve crush (ONC) in rat the retina.METHODS: The rat model of ONC was established. Rats were divided into normal control, ONC, and sham control groups. Histopathologic changes in retina, the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and retinal thickness of inner part (RTIP) were measured. The changes of CSE, CBS and 3-MST mRNA expression were detected with quantitative real-time PCR.RESULTS: The retinal histostructure was normal in normal controls and with minor changes in sham controls, respectively. Compared with sham group, significant retina damages were found in the ONC group: a time-dependent reduction of RGC number and RTIP. Expressions of CSE, CBS and 3-MST mRNA in rat retina were detected in normal control. Compared with normal controls, the expressions of CSE, CBS and 3-MST mRNA did not show any significant changes in the sham controls. Compared with sham controls, CBS mRNA expressions showed a time-dependent increase at 3 d, 7 d and 14 d after crush in the ONC group; CSE mRNA expressions increased to the peak at 3 d and then slightly reduced at 14 d after crush; 3-MST mRNA expressions showed the trend of increase at 3 d and 7 d and then enhanced remarkably at 14 d after crush.CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen sulfide synthases CSE, CBS and 3-MST expressions were up-regulated in rat retina following ONC, which may cause an increase in local endogenous hydrogen sulfide production in the retina and a compensatory protective effect.

Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) functions as a coenzyme in many enzymatic processes, including decarboxylation, deamination, transamination, racemization, and others. Enzymes, requiring PLP, are commonly termed PLP-dependent enzymes, and they are widely involved in crucial cellular metabolic pathways in most of (if not all) living organisms. The chemical mechanisms for PLP-mediated reactions have been well elaborated and accepted with an emphasis on the pure chemical steps, but how the chemical steps are processed by enzymes, especially by functions of active site residues, are not fully elucidated. Furthermore, the specific mechanism of an enzyme in relation to the one for a similar class of enzymes seems scarcely described or discussed. This discussion aims to link the specific mechanism described for the individual enzyme to the same types of enzymes from different species with aminotransferases, decarboxylases, racemase, aldolase, cystathionine ß-synthase, aromatic phenylacetaldehyde synthase, et al. as models. The structural factors that contribute to the reaction mechanisms, particularly active site residues critical for dictating the reaction specificity, are summarized in this review.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: A phase 1/2 clinical trial was performed in individuals with cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) deficient homocystinuria with aims to: (a) assess pharmacokinetics and safety of taurine therapy, (b) evaluate oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular function in CBS deficiency, and (c) evaluate the impact of short-term taurine treatment.METHODS: Individuals with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency with homocysteine &gt;50<U+2009>µM, without inflammatory disorder or on antioxidant therapy were enrolled. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]), and disease-related metabolites obtained at baseline were compared to normal values. While maintaining current treatment, patients were treated with 75<U+2009>mg/kg taurine twice daily, and treatment response assessed after 4 hours and 4 days.RESULTS: Fourteen patients (8-35<U+2009>years; 8 males, 6 females) were enrolled with baseline homocysteine levels 161<U+2009>±<U+2009>67<U+2009>µM. The study found high-dose taurine to be safe when excluding preexisting hypertriglyceridemia. Taurine pharmacokinetics showed a rapid peak level returning to near normal levels at 12<U+2009>hours, but had slow accumulation and elevated predosing levels after 4 days of treatment. Only a single parameter of oxidative stress, 2,3-dinor-8-isoprostaglandin-F2a, was elevated at baseline, with no elevated inflammatory parameters, and no change in FMD values overall. Taurine had no effect on any of these parameters. However, the effect of taurine was strongly related to pretreatment FMD values; and taurine significantly improved FMD in the subset of individuals with pretreatment FMD values &lt;10% and in individuals with homocysteine levels &gt;125<U+2009>µM, pertinent to endothelial function.CONCLUSION: Taurine improves endothelial function in CBS-deficient homocystinuria in patients with preexisting reduced function.

PURPOSE: Homocysteine (Hcy) in humans represents a blood-borne biomarker which predicts the risk of age-related diseases and mortality. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we tested whether feeding betaine-rich sugar beet molasses affects the survival under heat stress in the presence of Hcy, in spite of a gene loss in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase.METHODS: Knockdown of the genes relevant for remethylation or transsulfuration of Hcy was achieved by RNA interference (RNAi). Survival assay was conducted under heat stress at 37 °C and Hcy levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Addition of 500 mg/l betaine-rich sugar beet molasses (SBM) prevented the survival reduction that was caused by exposure to Hcy at 37 °C. Although SBM was no longer capable of reducing Hcy levels under RNAi versus homologues for 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or cystathionine-ß-synthase, it still enabled the survival extension by SBM under exposure to Hcy. In contrast, RNAi for the small heat shock protein hsp-16.2 or the foxo transcription factor daf-16 both prevented the extension of survival by betaine-rich molasses in the presence of Hcy.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that betaine-rich SBM is able to prevent survival reduction caused by Hcy in C. elegans in dependence on hsp-16.2 and daf-16 but independent of the remethylation pathway.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, resulting from a cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency, is an autosomal recessive disease associated with high levels of homocysteine. Such patients can present with severe mental retardation, ectopia lentis and osteoporosis and thromboembolic disease. To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of liver transplantation for CBS deficiency have been published. Here, we report a case of an 8-year-old male with a CBS deficiency that underwent living donor liver transplantation. The postoperative course was uneventful and homocysteine levels remained normal. The liver of this CBS deficiency patient was then successfully used in domino transplantation. The domino liver transplantation recipient was a 41-year-old male diagnosed with acute liver failure following hemi-liver resection due to cholangiocarcinoma. The domino recipient developed acquired hyperhomocysteinemia, which was controlled with a special regimen of medications. No complications relative to CBS deficiency were observed up to 11 months post-transplant. At this time, the patient expired as a result of cholangiocarcinoma recurrence. In conclusion, our data suggest that liver transplantation for CBS deficiency can be effective, safe and beneficial. It is possible to be both safe and beneficial to use a CBS deficiency patient as a domino donor for salvage liver transplantation in a selective category of recipients.

Gasotransmitters are endogenous small gaseous messengers exemplified by nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S or sulfide). Gasotransmitters are implicated in myriad physiologic functions including many aspects of reproduction. Our objective was to comprehensively review basic mechanisms and functions of gasotransmitters during pregnancy from conception to uterine involution and highlight future research opportunities. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases using combinations of keywords nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, sulfide, placenta, uterus, labor, and pregnancy. We included English language publications on human and animal studies from any date through August 2018 and retained basic and translational articles with relevant original findings. All gasotransmitters activate cGMP signaling. NO and sulfide also covalently modify target protein cysteines. Protein kinases and ion channels transduce gasotransmitter signals, and co-expressed gasotransmitters can be synergistic or antagonistic depending on cell type. Gasotransmitters influence tubal transit, placentation, cervical remodeling, and myometrial contractility. NO, CO, and sulfide dilate resistance vessels, suppress inflammation, and relax myometrium to promote uterine quiescence and normal placentation. Cervical remodeling and rupture of fetal membranes coincide with enhanced oxidation and altered gasotransmitter metabolism. Mechanisms mediating cellular and organismal changes in pregnancy due to gasotransmitters are largely unknown. Altered gasotransmitter signaling has been reported for preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm labor. However, in most cases specific molecular changes are not yet characterized. Nonclassical signaling pathways and the crosstalk among gasotransmitters are emerging investigation topics.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The presence of CBS in mouse vascular endothelium was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The relaxant activity of L-serine (0.1-300 µM) and L-cysteine (0.1-300 µM) was estimated on mouse aorta rings, with or without endothelium. A pharmacological modulation study evaluated NO and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) involvement. Levels of NO and S1P were also measured following incubation of aorta tissue with either L-serine (1, 10, and 100 µM) or L-cysteine (10, 100 µM, and 1 mM).KEY RESULTS: L-serine relaxed aorta rings in an endothelium-dependent manner. The vascular effect was reduced by L-NG-nitro-arginine methyl ester and wortmaninn. A similar pattern was obtained with L-cysteine. The S1P1 receptor antagonist (W146) or the SPT inhibitor (myriocin) reduced either L-serine or L-cysteine relaxant effect. L-serine or L-cysteine incubation increased NO and S1P levels in mouse aorta.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: L-serine, a by-product formed within the transsulfuration pathway starting from L-cysteine via CBS, contributes to the vasodilator action of L-cysteine. The L-serine effect involves both NO and S1P. This mechanism could be involved in the marked dysregulation of vascular tone in hyperhomocysteinemic patients (CBS deficiency) and may represent a feasible therapeutic target.

AIM: Abnormally high levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with autism spectrum disorder. Betaine is a methyl group donor in Hcy metabolism, and is known to prevent noxious Hcy accumulation. This study explored whether betaine could influence Hcy metabolism in a mouse model of autism and ameliorate behavioral abnormalities.METHODS: Pregnant ICR mice were administered valproic acid (VPA) intraperitoneally on Embryonic Day 12.5. Serum Hcy concentrations in the offspring were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expressions of Hcy-metabolism-related enzymes, betaine-Hcy methyltransferase, cystathionine ß-synthase, and methionine synthase, were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Offspring were treated by either betaine or saline at the age of 8<U+2009>weeks and serum Hcy concentrations were measured. Social behaviors were assessed by sniff-duration test and three-chamber test. Repetitive behavior was evaluated by marble-burying test. Tail-flick test was performed to measure nociceptive sensitivity.RESULTS: Prenatal VPA-exposed mice showed significantly elevated Hcy concentrations and decreased betaine-Hcy methyltransferase expression. Treatment with betaine could reduce Hcy level in VPA-exposed mice, attenuate social impairment and repetitive behavior, and normalize nociceptive sensitivity in this model.CONCLUSION: Betaine could ameliorate autism-like features and play a beneficial role in a mouse autism model induced by prenatal VPA exposure.

Hyperhomocysteinemia/Homocysteinuria is characterized by an increased level of toxic homocysteine in the plasma. The plasma concentration of homocysteine is 5-15<U+2009>µmol/L in healthy individuals, while in hyperhomocysteinemic patients, it can be as high as 500<U+2009>µmol/L. While increased homocysteine levels can cause symptoms such as osteoporosis and eye lens dislocation, high homocysteine levels are most closely associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent advances have shown that increased plasma Hcy is also a fundamental cause of neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia), diabetes, Down syndrome, and megaloblastic anemia, among others. In recent years, increased plasma homocysteine has also been shown to be closely related to cancer. In this review, we discuss the relation between elevated plasma Hcy levels and cancer, and we conclude that disturbed homocysteine metabolism is associated with cancer. Future clinical perspectives are also discussed.

The regulatory loop between long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs has a dynamic role in transcriptional and translational regulation, and is involved in cancer. However, the regulatory circuitry between lncRNAs and microRNAs in tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that a nuclear lncRNA LINC00336 is upregulated in lung cancer and functions as an oncogene by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs). LINC00336 bound RNA-binding protein ELAVL1 (ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1) using nucleotides 1901-2107 of LINC00336 and the RRM interaction domain and key amino acids (aa) of ELAVL1 (aa 101-213), inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, ELAVL1 increased LINC00336 expression by stabilizing its posttranscriptional level, whereas LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase) increased ELAVL1 expression through the p53 signaling pathway, further supporting the hypothesis that LSH promotes LINC00336 expression. Interestingly, LINC00336 served as an endogenous sponge of microRNA 6852 (MIR6852) to regulate the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), a surrogate marker of ferroptosis. Finally, we found that MIR6852 inhibited cell growth by promoting ferroptosis. These data show that the network of lncRNA and ceRNA has an important role in tumorigenesis and ferroptosis.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are idiopathic autoimmune diseases that are characterized by inflammation of both the small and large intestine. Although IBD is common in the general population, the pathophysiology remains ambiguous. Clear understanding of IBD pathophysiology would be a major step toward curative treatment in the future. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases including IBD, but homocystinuria has not been associated with IBD before. We report a 9-year-old girl with Crohn's disease and homocystinuria. Her gastrointestinal symptoms improved significantly upon classical homocystinuria treatment, and her last colonoscopy showed a pronounced remission. This case supports the inflammatory role of homocysteine in the gastrointestinal tract and the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and IBD manifestations.

Uterine vasodilation dramatically increases during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle and pregnancy, which are estrogen-dominant physiological states. Uterine vasodilation is believed to be mainly controlled by local uterine artery (UA) production of vasodilators and angiogenic factors. The extremely potent vasodilator and proangiogenic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized via metabolizing L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). This study was designed to determine if UA H2S production increases with augmented expression and/or activity of CBS and/or CTH during the ovarian cycle and pregnancy in sheep. Uterine arteries from intact nonpregnant (NP) luteal and follicular phase and late (130-135 days, term  145 days) pregnant (P) ewes were collected; endothelium-enriched proteins (UAendo) and endothelium-denuded smooth muscle (UAvsm) were mechanically prepared for accessing CBS and CTH proteins by immunoblotting; their cellular localization was determined by semi-quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy. H2S production was measured by the methylene blue assay. Immunoblotting revealed that CBS but not CTH protein was greater in P &gt; &gt; &gt; NP follicular &gt; luteal UAendo and UAvsm (P &lt; 0.001). H2S production was greater in P &gt; &gt; &gt; NP UAendo and UAvsm (P &lt; 0.01). Pregnancy-augmented UAendo and UAvsm H2S production was inhibited by the specific CBS but not CTH inhibitor. CBS and CTH proteins were localized to both endothelium and smooth muscle; however, only CBS protein was significantly greater in P vs NP UA endothelium and smooth muscle. Thus, ovine UA H2S production is significantly augmented via selectively upregulating endothelium and smooth muscle CBS during the follicular phase and pregnancy in vivo.

Dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been reported to extend lifespan, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce adiposity and inflammation response, and in particular, increase endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. H2S is a critical anti-inflammatory molecule in the central nervous system and a gaseous signal molecule that mediates learning and memory function. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate whether MR can ameliorate the impairment of learning and memory function induced by obesity, and to clarify its possible mechanisms. C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet or a high-fat (HF) diet to induce obesity, and were then fed a control diet (CON group, 4.2% fat, 0.86% methionine), a HF diet (HF group, 24% fat, 0.86% methionine), or an MR diet (MR group, 24% fat, 0.17% methionine) for 16 consecutive weeks. Our results showed that HF-induced obesity impaired learning and memory function, reduced H2S production in the hippocampus, cortex, and plasma, and increased plasma and hippocampal inflammation response in the mice. MR improved the impairment of learning and memory function accompanied by selective modulation of the expression of multiple related genes, reduced plasma and hippocampal inflammatory response, normalized H2S levels in the hippocampus, cortex, and plasma, up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of cystathionine ß-synthase in the hippocampus, and reduced hippocampal homocysteine level. These findings suggest that MR can ameliorate the impairment of learning and memory function, likely by increasing H2S production in the hippocampus.

To improve NBS, decision limits should be revised considering the population median. Relevant markers should be combined; use of the postanalytical tools offered by the CLIR project (Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports, which considers, for example, birth weight and gestational age) is recommended. tHcy and methylmalonic acid should be implemented as second-tier markers.</AbstractText>: Due to the favorable outcome of early treated patients, NBS for homocystinurias is recommended.

RATIONALE: Risk factors of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) are usually divided into acquired risks (e.g., trauma and pregnancy) and genetic risks (inherited thrombophilia). It is essential but not easy to identify the exact one for each patient.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 14-year-old male patient was admitted in our hospital because of progressively exacerbated severe headache and vomiting for 3 days, accompanied by transient weakness once in his right leg.DIAGNOSIS: CVST due to hyperhomocysteinemia with cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) gene mutation.INTERVENTIONS: Persistent oral anticoagulant therapy.OUTCOMES: Follow-ups at 4 months and 1 year showed that the patient's symptoms alleviated and did not recur, accompanied with improved MRV image; however, the cranial MRV image did not display as a completely normal one.LESSONS: We recommend that in case of thrombophilic state, serum homocysteine (Hcy), folic acid, and vitamin B12 levels should be routinely screened; when serum Hcy level is extremely high, congenital diseases caused by gene mutations should be considered. We firstly discovered a new mutation of CBS c.949A&gt;G which had not been reported before.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endogenous H2S regulates multiple physiological and pathological processes in colon epithelial tissues. The current study investigated the role of cystathionine ß-synthase [CBS], a major producer of H2S in colon epithelial cells, in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis [UC]-related intestinal barrier injury. The expression and DNA methylation level of CBS were investigated in inflamed and non-inflamed colon tissues collected from UC patients, and the effect of decreased CBS levels on Caco-2 monolayer barrier injury and altered status of tight junctions elicited by tumour necrosis factor/interferon [TNF/IFN] was determined.METHODS: The expression of CBS and the methylation level of the CBS promoter were assessed in non-inflamed and inflamed colon epithelial tissue samples collected from UC patients. Barrier function, status of tight junction proteins and activation of the NF-<U+03BA>B p65-mediated MLCK-P-MLC signalling pathway were further investigated in Caco-2 monolayers.RESULTS: Decreased expression of CBS and elevated methylation levels of the CBS promoter were observed in inflamed sites compared with in non-inflamed sites in the colon epithelial samples from UC patients. In Caco-2 monolayers, decreased expression of CBS exacerbated TNF/IFN-induced barrier injury and altered localization of tight junction proteins. Decreased expression of CBS predisposed Caco-2 monolayers to injury elicited by TNF/IFN via augmentation of the NF-<U+03BA>B p65-mediated MLCK-P-MLC signalling pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased expression of CBS propagates the pathogenesis of UC by exacerbating inflammation-induced intestinal barrier injury. Elevated methylation of the CBS promoter might be one of the mechanisms underlying the decreased expression of CBS in inflamed sites of colon epithelial tissues from UC patients.

OBJECTIVE: Vitiligo is a multifactorial polygenic disorder with a complex pathogenesis. It is related to both genetic and no genetic factors. The role of genetics is currently studied with several analytical approaches, such as genetic linkage, candidate gene association studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), deep DNA re-sequencing and gene expression studies. To date, there are no genetic traits directly related to vitiligo pathogenesis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 43 cases of vitiligo patients and 30 healthy donors recruited as control, were screened by assaying the biochemical molecules involved in the self-cells cytotoxicity (haptoglobin and homocysteine) and candidate genes involved in the regulatory process of the re-methylation cycles and transsulfuration. Candidate genes and their polymorphisms screened are methylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C; cystathionine-beta-synthase enzyme (CBS) I278T and Ins68bp; and methionine-synthase-reductase (MTRR) A66G.RESULTS: A peculiar genetic profile in vitiligo patients are defined: 11.6% of vitiligo patients shown polymorphic variant MTHFR 677TT vs. 3.3% of healthy donor MTHFR 677CC profile (p=0.0017); 14.0% of vitiligo patients shown CBS polymorphic variant 278TT vs. 3.3% of healthy donor 278II profile (p=0.0012); and 11.6% of vitiligo patients shown MTRR 66GG vs. 3.3% of healthy donor MTRR 677AA profile (p&gt;0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the correlation between the polymorphic status of MTHFR C677T, CBS I278T, and MTRR A66G and vitiligo. The genetic screening of these polymorphisms could be useful for early detection of the inheritance risk factor in a subject carrying relatives with vitiligo. Although these data could suggest a kind of dysregulation, genetically based, of thiols production mechanisms. Based on these results, we have not been able to get hypothesis about the putative pathogenesis of vitiligo, and the precise cause remains unclear.

Identifying dosage-sensitive genes is a key to understand the mechanisms underlying intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS). The Dp(17Abcg1-Cbs)1Yah DS mouse model (Dp1Yah) shows cognitive phenotypes that need to be investigated to identify the main genetic driver. Here, we report that three copies of the cystathionine-beta-synthase gene (Cbs) in the Dp1Yah mice are necessary to observe a deficit in the novel object recognition (NOR) paradigm. Moreover, the overexpression of Cbs alone is sufficient to induce deficits in the NOR test. Accordingly, overexpressing human CBS specifically in Camk2a-expressing neurons leads to impaired objects discrimination. Altogether, this shows that Cbs overdosage is involved in DS learning and memory phenotypes. To go further, we identified compounds that interfere with the phenotypical consequence of CBS overdosage in yeast. Pharmacological intervention in Tg(CBS) mice with one selected compound restored memory in the NOR test. In addition, using a genetic approach, we demonstrated an epistatic interaction between Cbs and Dyrk1a, another human chromosome 21-located gene (which encodes the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1a) and an already known target for DS therapeutic intervention. Further analysis using proteomic approaches highlighted several molecular pathways, including synaptic transmission, cell projection morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton, that are affected by DYRK1A and CBS overexpression. Overall, we demonstrated that CBS overdosage underpins the DS-related recognition memory deficit and that both CBS and DYRK1A interact to control accurate memory processes in DS. In addition, our study establishes CBS as an intervention point for treating intellectual deficiencies linked to DS.

The combination of traditional Chinese medicines can improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. Furthermore, the combination of the traditional Chinese medicine curcuma zedoary and kelp was used to enhance the effect of the dissipation of blood stasis in pediatrics during the Song Dynasty. Curcumenol and laminarin, the main components of curcuma zedoary and kelp, are also reported to have a wide range of biological activities. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp may prevent the development of cancer. The aim of this research was to confirm whether a combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of hepatoma cells and consequently improve prognosis. In this study, we firstly found in H22-bearing mice that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp inhibited tumor growth and the expression of metastasis-related proteins (MMPs, VEGF, pAkt, pERK1/2). Meanwhile, the decreased cystathionine beta synthase (CBS, an endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthetase) level was also observed in H22-bearing mice admistrated with the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp. It was also observed that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the potential inhibiting mechanism of the combination of curcumenol and laminarin on HepG2 cell proliferation and metastasis. Our previous research showed that a CBS/H2S system was vital for maintaining the proliferation in hepatoma cells. Here, we found that the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 were decreased in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells and the combination of curcumenol and laminarin significantly decreased the H2S level in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 in HepG2 cells. Angiogenesis, positively regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is essential for human cancer metastasis. In the present study, we found that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin could significantly down-regulate the expression levels of VEGF and its downstream key genes pAkt and pERK1/2. Furthermore, previous research showed that hydrogen sulfide could stimulate angiogenesis. Here, we also observed the reduction of the VEGF, Akt, pAkt, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 proteins levels and the inhibition of proliferation and metastasis in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells. Moreover, exogenous H2S rescued the cytological results caused by the combination of curcumenol and laminarin. Taken together, the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting endogenous H2S production and down-regulating the pSTAT3/BCL-2 and VEGF pathway, which provides strong evidence for the application of curcuma zedoary and kelp in treatments of liver cancer.

KEY MESSAGE: Here, we used a hxk1 mutant in the Col-0 background. We demonstrated that HXK1 regulates cell proliferation and expansion early during leaf development, and that HXK1 is involved in sucrose-induced leaf growth stimulation independent of GPT2. Furthermore, we identified KIN<U+03B3> as a novel HXK1-interacting protein. In the last decade, extensive efforts have been made to unravel the underlying mechanisms of plant growth control through sugar availability. Signaling by the conserved glucose sensor HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1) has been shown to exert both growth-promoting and growth-inhibitory effects depending on the sugar levels, the environmental conditions and the plant species. Here, we used a hxk1 mutant in the Col-0 background to investigate the role of HXK1 during leaf growth in more detail and show that it is affected in both cell proliferation and cell expansion early during leaf development. Furthermore, the hxk1 mutant is less sensitive to sucrose-induced cell proliferation with no significant increase in final leaf growth after transfer to sucrose. Early during leaf development, transfer to sucrose stimulates expression of GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE/PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER2 (GPT2) and represses chloroplast differentiation. However, in the hxk1 mutant GPT2 expression was still upregulated by transfer to sucrose although chloroplast differentiation was not affected, suggesting that GPT2 is not involved in HXK1-dependent regulation of leaf growth. Finally, using tandem affinity purification of protein complexes from cell cultures, we identified KIN<U+03B3>, a protein containing four cystathionine ß-synthase domains, as an interacting protein of HXK1.

Cysteine (Cys) is the first identified molecule in plant metabolism which includes both sulfur and nitrogen. It can be synthesized in three cellular compartments, containing chloroplast, cytoplasm and mitochondrion. The final step of cysteine biosynthesis is catalyzed by the O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase enzyme (OASTL, E.C. 4.2.99). In the present study, seven members of the OASTL gene family in the sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genome were identified at a genome-wide scale and comparative bioinformatics analyses were performed between sorghum and Arabidopsis OASTLs. In all OASTL proteins, a pyridoxal-phosphate dependent domain structure (PALP, PF00291) was identified. The gene ontology annotations also revealed that all sorghum OASTL genes have KOG1252 (Cystathionine beta-synthase and related enzyme) and K01738 (cysteine synthase A) activities. In promotor sequences of OASTL genes, diverse cis-acting elements were found, including hormone and light responsiveness, abiotic stress responsiveness, and tissue-specific ones (meristem and endosperm). Sorghum OASTL genes demonstrated medium or high level expressions in anatomical parts and developmental stages based on the digital expression data. Expression of OASTL genes were also analyzed under cadmium (Cd) stress in sorghum by Real Time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The results exclusively showed that OASTL A1-2 gene was 1.12 fold up-regulated in roots, whereas cysteine synthase 26 was 2.25 fold down-regulated in leaves. The predicted 3D structure of OASTLs indicated some structural diversities as well as variations in the secondary structures.

Homocystinuria is a rare inborn error of methionine metabolism caused by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency. The prevalence of homocystinuria in Qatar is 1:1,800 births, mainly due to a founder Qatari missense mutation, c.1006C&gt;T; p.R336C (p.Arg336Cys). We characterized the structure-function relationship of the p.R336C-mutant protein and investigated the effect of different chemical chaperones to restore p.R336C-CBS activity using three models: in silico, <U+0394>CBS yeast, and CRISPR/Cas9 p.R336C knock-in HEK293T and HepG2 cell lines. Protein modeling suggested that the p.R336C induces severe conformational and structural changes, perhaps influencing CBS activity. Wild-type CBS, but not the p.R336C mutant, was able to restore the yeast growth in <U+0394>CBS-deficient yeast in a complementation assay. The p.R336C knock-in HEK293T and HepG2 cells decreased the level of CBS expression and reduced its structural stability; however, treatment of the p.R336C knock-in HEK293T cells with betaine, a chemical chaperone, restored the stability and tetrameric conformation of CBS, but not its activity. Collectively, these results indicate that the p.R336C mutation has a deleterious effect on CBS structure, stability, and activity, and using the chemical chaperones approach for treatment could be ineffective in restoring p.R336C CBS activity.



#### Evidence that regulation of intramembrane proteolysis is mediated by substrate gating during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.

During the morphological process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis two adjacent daughter cells (called the mother cell and forespore) follow different programs of gene expression that are linked to each other by signal transduction pathways. At a late stage in development, a signaling pathway emanating from the forespore triggers the proteolytic activation of the mother cell transcription factor sK. Cleavage of pro-sK to its mature and active form is catalyzed by the intramembrane cleaving metalloprotease SpoIVFB (B), a Site-2 Protease (S2P) family member. B is held inactive by two mother-cell membrane proteins SpoIVFA (A) and BofA. Activation of pro-sK processing requires a site-1 signaling protease SpoIVB (IVB) that is secreted from the forespore into the space between the two cells. IVB cleaves the extracellular domain of A but how this cleavage activates intramembrane proteolysis has remained unclear. Structural studies of the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii S2P homolog identified closed (substrate-occluded) and open (substrate-accessible) conformations of the protease, but the biological relevance of these conformations has not been established. Here, using co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy, we show that stable association between the membrane-embedded protease and its substrate requires IVB signaling. We further show that the cytoplasmic cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domain of the B protease is not critical for this interaction or for pro-sK processing, suggesting the IVB-dependent interaction site is in the membrane protease domain. Finally, we provide evidence that the B protease domain adopts both open and closed conformations in vivo. Collectively, our data support a substrate-gating model in which IVB-dependent cleavage of A on one side of the membrane triggers a conformational change in the membrane-embedded protease from a closed to an open state allowing pro-sK access to the caged interior of the protease.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the role of miR-191 in apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells and in the involvement of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Renal transplantation rat model was established. miR-191 and Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The regulation of miR-191 on CBS was detected by luciferase reporter assay. We found miR-191 expression in platelets and platelet microvesicles (P-MVs) of patients and model rats was significantly upregulated than that of health and normal rats. Also, mRNA and protein levels of CBS in renal tissues of patients were significantly downregulated than that of health and normal rats. We also found that P-MVs could transfer miR-191 to HK-2 cells. Luciferase reporter assay showed that CBS was a direct target of miR-191. In addition, we proved that P-MVs-secreted miR-191 inhibited CBS expression in HK-2 cells, and P-MVs-secreted miR-191 promoted HK-2 cell apoptosis via CBS. Finally, we verified the trends of CBS expressions, HK-2 cell apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins in vivo were similar as the trends in vitro. Therefore, CBS was a direct target of miR-191, and miR-191 could transfer to HK-2 cells via P-MVs to decrease the expression of CBS, thus to promote cell apoptosis and renal IR injury.

The d-isomer of Met cannot be used directly by the mammary gland in dairy cows; instead, it is transformed into l-Met, the proteogenic isomer, in the liver and other extramammary tissues. It remains unclear whether different Met forms and a Met hydroxy analog, 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (HMB), are metabolized and function similarly in the liver. The objective of the present study was to examine the regulation of key genes in Met regeneration, transulfuration, and transmethylation pathways in response to increasing doses of different Met forms. Hepatocytes isolated from 4 calves between 4 and 7 d old were maintained as monolayer cultures for 24 h before addition of treatments. Treatments of (0, 10, 20, 40 µM) d-Met, l-Met, dl-Met, dl-HMB, or a 1:1 mixture of dl-Met and dl-HMB were added to Met-free medium in triplicate. After 24 h, cell lysates were collected for quantification of gene expression by quantitative PCR, and mRNA abundance was normalized to the mean of 3 reference genes. Data were analyzed with PROC MIXED of SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Analyses of covariance confirmed equivalent slopes of Met form, and the final model included form, dose, and random effect of calf within form. Data are reported as least squares means ± standard error. No main effect of Met form was observed for any genes examined. The enzymes encoded by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase use betaine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, respectively, to regenerate Met from homocysteine. Increasing concentration of Met did not alter 5-methyltetrahydrofolate expression, but decreased BHMT expression. Expression of glycine N-methyltransferase, the enzyme that controls transmethylation flux from S-adenosyl-methionine, was not affected by Met concentration. Methionine concentration had no effect on expression of cystathionine ß-synthase, a key enzyme for the transulfuration pathway. The decrease in BHMT expression indicates a decreased need for cellular Met regeneration with increasing Met concentration, independent of Met form. The lack of differences among Met forms on regulating genes examined indicates that all Met forms similarly reduced genes controlling Met regeneration and metabolism in primary bovine hepatocytes.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy disorder that increases maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. High plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are a risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) plays an important role in Hcy homeostasis catalyzing the irreversible degradation of Hcy to cystathionine, protecting the endothelium from injury caused by hypoxia. Several mutations and polymorphisms may alter the expression of the CBS gene, resulting in variable levels of Hcy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of CBS gene polymorphisms with PE in Mexican women. A case-control study consisting of 129 pregnant women with PE (37 severe and 92 mild) and 173 women with uncomplicated pregnancies was performed. Polymorphisms, such as G797A, C785T, T833C, G919A, T959C, C1105T, and 844ins68 base pair, in the CBS gene were genotyped. The polymorphism G797A was monomorphic in cases with the presence of only G797A-G allele. Allele C785T-T and genotype C785T-C/T were associated with susceptibility in severe and mild PE. Alleles G797A-G and T959C-T were associated with susceptibility only in severe PE. Haplotype TGTWGTC was of susceptibility for severe PE and of protection for mild PE. Haplotypes CGTWGCC and CATWGTC seem to be protective for severe PE, but the latter is related to susceptibility in mild PE. The results suggest that C785T, G797A, and T959C mutations are contributing in different ways in severe and mild PE in our population and could be count as another related factor for this disease.

We evaluated whether the marmoset, a nonhuman primate, can serve as a good model to study aging-related changes in the kidney by employing healthy young and aged marmosets of both sexes. Aging was associated with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and arteriolosclerosis in both sexes; correspondingly, the content of matrix proteins was increased. Functionally, aging resulted in an increase in urinary albumin and protein excretion. There was a robust correlation between markers of fibrosis and functional changes. We explored signaling pathways as potential mechanistic events. Aging in males, but not in females, was associated with reduced renal cortical activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and a trend toward activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); upstream of AMPK and mTORC1, Akt and IGF-1 receptor were activated. In both sexes, aging promoted kidney activation of transforming growth factor ß-1 signaling pathway. While the expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), an enzyme involved hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis, was reduced in both aged males and females, decreased H2S generation was seen in only males. Our studies show that the marmoset is a valid model to study kidney aging; some of the signaling pathways involved in renal senescence differ between male and female marmosets.

Insufficient supply of Met and choline (Chol) around parturition could compromise hepatic metabolism and milk protein synthesis in dairy cows. Mechanistic responses associated with supply of Met or Chol in primary liver cells enriched with hepatocytes (PHEP) from cows have not been thoroughly ascertained. Objectives were to isolate and culture PHEP to examine abundance of genes and proteins related to transmethylation, transsulfuration, and cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) pathways in response to Met or Chol. The PHEP were isolated from liver biopsies of Holstein cows (160 d in lactation). More than 90% of isolated cells stained positively for the hepatocyte marker cytokeratin 18. Cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) mRNA abundance was only detectable in the PHEP and liver tissue compared with mammary tissue. Furthermore, in response to exogenous Met (80 µM vs. control) PHEP secreted greater amounts of albumin and urea. Subsequently, PHEP were cultured with Met (40 µM) or Chol (80 mg/dL) for 24 h. Compared with control or Chol, mRNA and protein abundance of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) were greater in PHEP treated with Met. The mRNA abundance of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), and sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) was greater in Met-treated PHEP compared with control or Chol. Compared with control, greater expression of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH), and choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) was observed in cells supplemented with Met and Chol. However, Chol led to the greatest mRNA abundance of CHDH. Abundance of choline kinase a (CHKA), choline kinase ß (CHKB), phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1 a (PCYT1A), and choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1) in the CDP-choline pathway was greater in PHEP treated with Chol compared with control or Met. In the transsulfuration pathway, mRNA and protein abundance of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) was greater in PHEP treated with Met compared with control or Chol. Similarly, abundance of cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC), and glutathione reductase (GSR) was greater in response to Met compared with control or Chol. Overall, these findings suggest that transmethylation and transsulfuration in dairy cow primary liver cells are more responsive to Met supply, whereas the CDP-choline pathway is more responsive to Chol supply. The relevance of these data in vivo merit further study.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent vasodilator and proangiogenic second messenger synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). Estrogens are potent vasodilators that stimulate H2S biosynthesis in uterine arteries (UA) in vivo; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that estrogens stimulate H2S biosynthesis in UA endothelial cells (UAEC) via specific estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent mechanisms. In cultured primary UAEC, treatment with estradiol-17ß (E2ß) stimulated CBS and CTH mRNAs and proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. As little as 0.1 nM E2ß was effective in increasing CBS and CTH expressions and these stimulatory effects maximized with 10-100 nM E2ß at 48-72 h. E2ß also activated CBS and CTH promoters in UAEC, leading to CBS and CTH expression. Treatment with E2ß stimulated H2S production, which was blocked by specific inhibitors of either CBS or CTH and their combination and the ER antagonist ICI 182780. Treatment with either specific agonist of ERa or ERß stimulated both CBS and CTH mRNA and protein expressions and H2S production to levels similar to that of E2ß. Specific antagonist of either ERa or ERß blocked E2ß-stimulated CBS and CTH mRNA and protein expressions and H2S production. Combinations of either ERa or ERß agonists or their antagonists had no additive effects. Thus, E2ß stimulates H2S production by upregulating CBS and CTH mRNA and protein expressions through specific ERa or ERß-dependent CBS and CTH transcription in UAEC in vitro.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is responsible for the first enzymatic reaction in the transsulfuration pathway of sulfur amino acids. The molecular function and mechanism of CBS as well as that of transsulfuration pathway remain ill-defined in cell proliferation and death. In the present study, we designed, synthesized and obtained a bioactive inhibitor CH004 for human CBS, which functions in vitro and in vivo. CH004 inhibits CBS activity, elevated the cellular homocysteine and suppressed the production of hydrogen sulfide in a dose-dependent manner in cells or in vivo. Chemical or genetic inhibition of CBS demonstrates that endogenous CBS is closely coupled with cell proliferation and cell cycle. Moreover, CH004 substantially retarded in vivo tumor growth in a xenograft mice model of liver cancer. Importantly, inhibition of CBS triggers ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, the study provides several clues for studying the interplays amongst transsulfuration pathway, ferroptosis and liver cancer.

AIMS: The induction of excessive autophagy by increased levels of oxidative stress is one of the main mechanisms underlying unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to have an anti-oxidative effect, but its mode of action on excessive autophagy in vascular endothelial cells is unclear.METHODS: Surgery was used to induce UUO in male C57BL/6 mice as an in vivo model. Human renal epithelial cells (HK-2) were treated with H2O2 as an in vitro model. NaHS was used as an exogenous H2S donor. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to observe the structure of renal autophagosomes. The expression of proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis was detected by western blot analysis in vivo and in vitro. Flow cytometry (DCFH-DA) was used to examine the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to detect cell apoptosis. Compound C was used to analyze the association of AMPK with autophagy.RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, in which the ureter was exposed but not ligated, the cell apoptosis index, number of autophagosomes, protein expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (LC3)-II/I, beclin-1, and p-AMPK/AMPK were significantly increased in the UUO group. On the other hand, p62, cystathionine ß-synthase, and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase protein expression levels and H2S concentration were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). These alterations were ameliorated by the addition of NaHS (p &lt; 0.05). Similar results were observed in vitro. By using the AMPK inhibitor compound C, it was indicated that AMPK was involved in ROS-induced autophagy. In addition, using tissue from patients with obstructive nephropathy, excessive autophagy was observed by an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.CONCLUSION: NaHS-treatment may exert a protective effect on mouse kidney against UUO by suppressing the ROS-AMPK pathway. ROS-AMPK-mediated autophagy may represent a promising therapeutic target for obstructive nephropathy.

Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is one of the 225 genes on chromosome 21 (HSA 21) that are triplicated in persons with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Although most triplicate HSA21 genes have their orthologous genes on murine chromosome 16, the murine ortholog of hCBS is on murine chromosome 17 and thus is not present in the well-studied Ts65Dn mouse model of trisomy 21. Persons with trisomy 21 (T21) present deficits in neurotransmission and exhibit early brain aging that can partially be explained by monoamine neurotransmitter alterations. We used transgenic mice for the hCBS gene, which overexpress the CBS protein in various brain regions, to study if CBS overexpression induces modifications in the monoamine neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and striatum from transgenic and control female and male mice aged 3-4 months and 11-12 months. Sex, age, and brain area each influenced neurotransmitter levels. Briefly, the serotonin pathway was modified by CBS overexpression in various brain areas in female mice but not in male mice. The dopamine pathway was modified in brain regions according to sex and age. These results may allow us to better understand the role of the transsulfuration pathway and especially CBS overexpression in the metabolism of biogenic amines and the catecholamine catabolism in persons with trisomy 21.

RESULTS: We found that hippocampal RSS level increased significantly in response to learning. We further demonstrated that the activity-triggered RSS signal controlled memory formation by using pharmacological and genetic approaches. The RSS-supporting memory was primarily conferred by enzymes that were mainly located in astrocytes, including cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), and the memory-promoting effects were mostly dependent on sulfration of the NR2A subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Further, RSS were demonstrated to buffer the strong inhibitory effect of synaptically released zinc on NR2A-containing NMDARs. Innovation and Conclusion: These results suggest that glial-derived RSS signals can serve as direct gliotransmitters that regulate memory formation through the redox modulation of postsynaptic receptors; this conclusion will enrich the gliotransmission hypothesis.

PURPOSE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gaseous molecule with important physiological roles. It is synthesized from cysteine by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). The present study examined the benefits of exogenous H2S on renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury, as well as the effects of CGL or CBS inhibition. Furthermore, we elucidated the mechanism underlying the action of H2S in the kidneys.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: a sham, renal IR control, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) treatment, H2S donor, and CGL or CBS inhibitor administration group. Levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), renal tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were estimated. Histological changes, apoptosis, and expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38) were also evaluated.RESULTS: NaHS attenuated serum BUN and Cr levels, as well as histological damage caused by renal IR injury. Administration of NaHS also reduced oxidative stress as evident from decreased MDA, preserved SOD, and reduced apoptotic cells. Additionally, NaHS prevented renal IR-induced MAPK phosphorylation. The CGL or CBS group showed increased MAPK family activity; however, there was no significant difference in the IR control group.CONCLUSION: Exogenous H2S can mitigate IR injury-led renal damage. The proposed beneficial effect of H2S is, in part, because of the anti-oxidative stress associated with modulation of the MAPK signaling pathways.

Hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency is associated with diverse cognitive dysfunction. Considering the role of the serine/threonine kinase DYRK1A, not only in developmental defects with life-long structural and functional consequences, but also in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, its protein expression and kinase activity has been analyzed in brain of heterozygous CBS deficient mice and found to be increased. We previously demonstrated that specific liver treatment with an adenovirus expressing Dyrk1A normalizes hepatic DYRK1A level and decreases hyperhomocysteinemia in mice with moderate to intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia. We here use a hepatocyte-specific recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) serotype 8-mediated DYRK1A gene therapy (AAV2/8-DYRK1A) to analyze the effect of hepatic Dyrk1A gene transfer on some altered molecular mechanisms in brain of mice with intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia. Our selective hepatic treatment alleviates altered DYRK1A protein level and signaling pathways in brain of mice, the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways initiated by receptor tyrosine kinase, the BDNF dependent TrkB pathway, and NFkB pathway. These results demonstrate the positive effect of AAV2/8-DYRK1A gene transfer on neuropathological and inflammatory processes in brain of mice with intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia.

Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder with a population frequency of approximately 1 in 10,000. The most common epigenetic defect in BWS is a loss of methylation (LOM) at the 11p15.5 imprinting centre, KCNQ1OT1 TSS-DMR, and affects 50% of cases. We hypothesised that genetic factors linked to folate metabolism may play a role in BWS predisposition via effects on methylation maintenance at KCNQ1OT1 TSS-DMR.</AbstractText>: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder with a population frequency of approximately 1 in 10,000.

We hypothesised that genetic factors linked to folate metabolism may play a role in BWS predisposition via effects on methylation maintenance at KCNQ1OT1 TSS-DMR.Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the folate pathway affecting methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (MTR), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT1A) were examined in 55 BWS patients with KCNQ1OT1 TSS-DMR LOM and in 100 unaffected cases. MTHFR rs1801133: C&gt;T was more prevalent in BWS with KCNQ1OT1 TSS-DMR LOM (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.017); however, the relationship was not significant when the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied (significance, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0036). None of the remaining 13 SNVs were significantly different in the two populations tested. The DNMT1 locus was screened in 53 BWS cases, and three rare missense variants were identified in each of three patients: rs138841970: C&gt;T, rs150331990: A&gt;G and rs757460628: G&gt;A encoding NP_001124295 p.Arg136Cys, p.His1118Arg and p.Arg1223His, respectively. These variants have population frequencies of less than 1 in 1000 and were absent from 100 control cases. Functional characterization using a hemimethylated DNA trapping assay revealed a reduced methyltransferase activity relative to wild-type DNMT1 for each variant ranging from 40 to 70% reduction in activity.</AbstractText>: Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the folate pathway affecting methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (MTR), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT1A) were examined in 55 BWS patients with KCNQ1OT1 TSS-DMR LOM and in 100 unaffected cases.

Our data suggests that reduced DNMT1 activity could affect maintenance of methylation at KCNQ1OT1 TSS-DMR in some cases of BWS, possibly via a maternal effect in the early embryo.

DL-2-hydroxy-4(methylthio) butanoic acid (DL-HMTBA) exhibits a higher antioxidant capability in vitro as compared to DL-Met, but the mechanism is still not known. A total of 400 8-day-old broiler chicks were allotted to a 2 [low (12 to 14°C) vs. control temperature (thermoneutral, 24 to 26°C)] × 2 (0.17% or 0.51% of DL-HMTBA) factorial arrangement to investigate effects of DL-HMTBA on antioxidant capacity and its related gene expression in lung and liver of broilers exposed to low temperature. The hepatic glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were decreased, whereas protein carbonyl and malodndialdehyde contents in lung were increased in low temperature (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 0.51% DL-HMTBA increased (P &lt; 0.05) GSH and GSH-Px activity in liver and SOD activity in lung in spite of the temperature. The greater gene expression of GSH reductase and lower expression of GSH synthetase (P &lt; 0.01) were observed in lung of broilers that were maintained at low temperature. Higher DL-HMTBA supplementation induced greater (P &lt; 0.05) mRNA expression of glutathione-S transferase in lung, GSH synthetase in liver and lung, as well as lower expression of GSH reductase in lung, and this effect were more obvious for the chicks exposed to low temperature (interaction, P &lt; 0.05). Chicks that were maintained under low temperature had the lower expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS), whereas those fed 0.51% DL-HMTBA increased the CßS expression in liver under low temperature (interaction, P = 0.05). The <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthetase and Met adenosyltransferase 1 (MAT1) gene expression were downregulated (P &lt; 0.05) by low temperature and the higher (P = 0.02) expression of MAT1 was observed in lung of chicks fed 0.51% DL-HMTBA. It indicated that under low temperature, DL-HMTBA supplementation at 0.51% upregulated gene expression of GSH synthesis and Met transsulfuration pathway in liver and lung to increase the antioxidant capacity, and then mitigate the negative effects of cold stress for broilers.

Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) display puzzling inter-individual phenotypic heterogeneity, conceivably related to inherent differences in antioxidant protection, hemoglobin binding, bilirubin catabolism and methyl group handling. Therefore, we explored putative associations between clinically important phenotypic measures and functional polymorphisms within specific candidate genes encoding glutathione S-transferase, haptoglobin, uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, and cystathionine beta-synthase. Two-hundred and thirty SCD participants (mean age 25.1<U+202F>±<U+202F>2.8) were recruited from Jamaica's Annual Sickle Cell Unit Cohort Review - two-hundred and five had homozygous hemoglobin SS (HbSS) disease, twenty-five had hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease. Regression analyses revealed some novel genotype-phenotype associations. HbSC participants had significantly lower mean lactate dehydrogenase (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.01) and glutathione (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.001) values than HbSS participants. Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) was significantly associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration using univariate (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.044) and multivariable regression (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.012). 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) was significantly associated with hemoglobin F % using univariate (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.010) and multivariable regression (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.009). In conclusion, this exploratory cross-sectional study generated novel, useable, and informative genotype-phenotype estimates of association, but larger studies are needed to determine whether these specific variants are related to inter-individual phenotypic variability in SCD.

Homocystinuria is a congenital metabolic disorder in which cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency results in a prominent increase in homocysteine (serum levels &gt;<U+2009>100 µM), causing mental retardation, atherosclerotic cerebral infarction, and osteoporosis accompanied by fragility fractures. Encountering a case with excessive homocysteinemia such as that seen in hereditary homocystinuria is unlikely during usual medical examinations. However, in individuals who have vitamin B or folate deficiency, serum homocysteine concentrations are known to increase. These individuals may also have a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, MTHFR (C677T: TT type), which regulates homocysteine metabolism. These changes in homocysteine levels may elicit symptoms resembling those of homocystinuria (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis).</AbstractText>: Homocystinuria is a congenital metabolic disorder in which cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency results in a prominent increase in homocysteine (serum levels &gt;<U+2009>100 µM), causing mental retardation, atherosclerotic cerebral infarction, and osteoporosis accompanied by fragility fractures.

Homocysteine is also known to increase oxidative stress, disrupt cross-linking of collagen molecules, and increase levels of advanced glycation end products, which results in reduced bone strength through a mechanism that goes beyond low bone density and increased bone resorption. Therefore, high serum homocysteine may be regarded as a factor that can reduce both bone mass and impair bone quality.

The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of deficiency or high level addition of methionine (Met) in diet on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and hepatic lipid metabolism in broiler. A completely random design was used with 3 dietary treatments with the addition of Met from DL-methionine (DLM) at 0%, 0.22%, and 0.32% in a basal diet. The analyzed dietary Met was 0.271%, 0.485%, and 0.584% respectively for the Met-deficient, sufficient, and excessive diet. A total of 360 one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to the treatments. The trial was last for 21 d. Compared to the Met-sufficient diet, the Met-deficient diet significantly resulted the decrease of 1 to 21 d growth performance and the increase of liver ether extract (EE). Compared to the Met-sufficient group, the expression of lipid transport gene apolipoprotein B (APOB) in both Met-deficient and Met-excessive group was decreased (P &lt; 0.05). However, compared to the Met-sufficient group, a decreased of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) was only shown in birds fed a Met-deficient diet (P &lt; 0.05). Although the plasma Hcy content was decreased, the expression of Cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS) and hepatic inflammatory cytokines included interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) was significantly decreased in birds fed the Met-deficient diet when compared to those in Met-sufficient group (P &lt; 0.05). When compared to the Met-sufficient group, the broilers in high dietary Met group had increased levels of catabolic enzyme genes expression especially acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (CHREBP) (P &lt; 0.05), and a decreased content of liver EE. In conclusion, dietary Met deficiency decreased the hepatic lipid export and subsequently increased the hepatic lipid accumulation. High dietary Met addition increased the hepatic lipid catabolism and subsequently decreased the liver lipid accumulation.

Enteromorpha prolifera is an edible alga and previous studies have indicated that E. prolifera polysaccharide (EP) attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-fat diet rats. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been found to exert many physiological effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether EP prevents NAFLD via regulation of H2S production. EP was orally administered to high-fat diet rats for 5 weeks. Treatment with EP (200 mg per kg body weight per d) significantly increased the serum H2S level and reduced the serum triglyceride level (p &lt; 0.05) in rats fed a high-fat diet. These effects were similar to those observed with NaHS, a H2S donor. Real-time PCR and western blotting analysis revealed that EP significantly upregulated hepatic mRNA and protein expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase, which is the enzyme responsible for H2S production. These results indicate that EP decreases the serum TG level by increasing H2S production, suggesting that EP may be beneficial for the treatment of NAFLD and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an essential neuromodulator, generates by cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) or 3-mecaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) in the brain. H2S can mediate paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neuron activity, and regulate neuroendocrine hormones secretion. On the other hand, CBS deficiency caused metabolic disorder and body weight reduction. However, whether CBS/H2S of PVN regulates neuroendocrine hormones to mediate energy metabolism is unknown. Here, we first identified the CBS co-localization with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) positive neurons. In HFD induced obese rats, CBS protein of hypothalamus decreased. By contrast, overexpression CBS in PVN via lentivirus, lowered food uptake, body weight and fat mass, and reduced blood glucose, lipid disorders and insulin resistance. Intriguingly, CBS overexpression increased the pre-TRH expression, slightly elevated plasma thyroxine and thyrotropin level, but decreased the plasma ACTH and corticosterone level. Then, we found that mTOR activation contributed to pre-TRH up-regulation by CBS/H2S system. In db/db obese mice, hypothalamus CBS/H2S system also down-regulated association with reduction pre-TRH expression; in contrast, CBS overexpression in PVN slightly elevated plasma leptin. Next, leptin stimulated FOXO3a nuclear translocation, increased FOXO3a binding activity to two binding sites of CBS promoter, and then enhanced CBS protein expression. In conclusion, leptin activates neuron CBS-H2S system by FOXO3a, regulates neuroendocrine hormones to modulate the energy homeostasis, thus highlights a new brain-adipose feedback axis in energy metabolism.

Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is an essential vitamin playing a crucial role in amino acid metabolism. Pyridoxine is used for isoniazid side-effects prevention, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy treatment and cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (homocystinuria) treatment. However, vitamin B6 hypervitaminosis is neurotoxic and may provoke a progressive sensory neuronopathy (sensory ganglionopathy), usually when daily uptake is above 50<U+2009>mg. We describe the case of a 30-year-old patient with homocystinuria who was treated with pyridoxine 1250-1750<U+2009>mg/day for 20 years and developed progressive sensory neuropathy with ataxia and impaired sensation in the extremities. Electrodiagnostic testing demonstrated non-length-dependent abnormalities of sensory nerve potentials, and sensory ganglionopathy was diagnosed. Pyridoxine dosage was reduced to 500<U+2009>mg/day, resulting in the disappearance of sensory symptoms and ataxia, and the normalisation of sensory nerve potentials. Our case indicates that pyridoxine-induced sensory ganglionopathy may be reversible, even after prolonged ingestion of high doses of vitamin B6 for more than 20 years.

Homocystinuria is a genetic inborn error of metabolism due to the deficiency of cystathionine ß-synthase resulting in increased serum homocysteine and methionine and decreased cysteine which predisposes affected individuals to arterial and venous thromboembolic phenomena. We present a case of homocystinuria who presented to us as a calcified right atrial mass during the evaluation for lower respiratory tract infection. Our case reveals an unusual mix of findings using imaging with multiple detector computed tomography and radiographs.

Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disorder most commonly caused by cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency. Severe cases can cause white matter abnormalities that can mimic other vascular, toxic and metabolic disorders on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We present such a case which demonstrates not only extensive white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging, but also previously unreported basal ganglia signal abnormalities and imaging manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, likely caused by elevated methionine and betaine therapy. We also review the literature and discuss the potential underlying biologic mechanisms of these imaging findings.



#### Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase Deficiency Deregulates Regional Brain Amyloid-ß Protein Precursor Expression and Phosphorylation Levels.

Deregulation of the amyloid-ß protein precursor (AßPP) plays a critical role in the neurodegenerative cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Significantly, common functional polymorphisms in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene are a risk factor for the development of late-onset AD. Reduced MTHFR activity is associated with alterations in folate and homocysteine metabolism. Here, we first show that in young MTHFR knockout mice, mild and severe MTHFR deficiency markedly increase cortical and hippocampal AßPP phosphorylation at the regulatory Thr668 site. However, the hippocampus is especially vulnerable to the effects of aging and mild MTHFR deficiency. Notably, the effects of severe MTHFR deficiency in young mice are recapitulated by prolonged dietary folate deficiency in old mice, which leads to regional brain accumulation of cystathionine due to impaired methylation of homocysteine. The incremental AßPP phosphorylation at Thr668 mediated by severe genetic-or diet-induced impairment of the folate cycle correlates with enhanced accumulation of demethylated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK-3ß). Lastly, we show that severe disturbances in folate metabolism can also affect AßPP expression levels in a brain region specific manner. Together our findings identify a novel link between genetic MTHFR deficiency, activation of GSK-3ß, demethylation of PP2A, and enhanced phosphorylation of AßPP at Thr668, which is known to critically influence neuronal AßPP function and pathological amyloidogenic processing. Deregulation of AßPP provides a novel mechanism by which common human MTHFR polymorphisms may interact with dietary folate deficiency to alter neuronal homeostasis and increase the risk for sporadic AD.



#### Oxidative stress in autoimmune rheumatic diseases.

The management of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains a significant challenge. Often the rheumatologist is restricted to treating and relieving the symptoms and consequences and not the underlying cause of the disease. Oxidative stress occurs in many autoimmune diseases, along with the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The sources of such reactive species include NADPH oxidases (NOXs), the mitochondrial electron transport chain, nitric oxide synthases, nitrite reductases, and the hydrogen sulfide producing enzymes cystathionine-ß synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3> lyase. Superoxide undergoes a dismutation reaction to generate hydrogen peroxide which, in the presence of transition metal ions (e.g. ferrous ions), forms the hydroxyl radical. The enzyme myeloperoxidase, present in inflammatory cells, produces hypochlorous acid, and in healthy individuals ROS and RNS production by phagocytic cells is important in microbial killing. Both low molecular weight antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxiredoxin remove ROS. However, when ROS production exceeds the antioxidant protection, oxidative stress occurs. Oxidative post-translational modifications of proteins then occur. Sometimes protein modifications may give rise to neoepitopes that are recognized by the immune system as 'non-self' and result in the formation of autoantibodies. The detection of autoantibodies against specific antigens, might improve both early diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity. Promising diagnostic autoantibodies include anti-carbamylated proteins and anti-oxidized type II collagen antibodies. Some of the most promising future strategies for redox-based therapeutic compounds are the activation of endogenous cellular antioxidant systems (e.g. Nrf2-dependent pathways), inhibition of disease-relevant sources of ROS/RNS (e.g. isoform-specific NOX inhibitors), or perhaps specifically scavenging disease-related ROS/RNS via site-specific antioxidants.

Classical homocystinuria, also known as cystathionine beta synthase deficiency, is a rare disorder of methionine metabolism, leading to an abnormal accumulation of homocysteine and its metabolites in blood and urine. A young child with homocystinuria is discussed, who presented with behavioral abnormalities, involuntary movement, mental retardation, and decreased vision since birth. The diagnosis of homocystinuria was not made at initial presentation. Subtle phenotypic features with developmental delay and MRI brain finding of bilateral medially dislocated lens, eventually provided the first indication at five years of age. Laboratory screening with plasma amino acid profile by ion exchange chromatography (IEC) showed elevated homocystine and methionine, and low cystine in plasma in the absence of vitamin B12, and folate deficiency; giving the diagnosis of classical homocysteinuria.

Crops are often subjected to a combination of stresses in the field. To date, studies on the physiological and molecular responses of common wheat to a combination of osmotic and cold stresses, however, remain unknown. In this study, wheat seedlings exposed to osmotic-cold stress for 24 h showed inhibited growth, as well as increased lipid peroxidation, relative electrolyte leakage, and soluble sugar contents. iTRAQ-based quantitative proteome method was employed to determine the proteomic profiles of the roots and leaves of wheat seedlings exposed to osmotic-cold stress conditions. A total of 250 and 258 proteins with significantly altered abundance in the roots and leaves were identified, respectively, and the majority of these proteins displayed differential abundance, thereby revealing organ-specific differences in adaptation to osmotic-cold stress. Yeast two hybrid assay examined five pairs of stress/defense-related protein-protein interactions in the predicted protein interaction network. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that abiotic stresses increased the expression of three candidate protein genes, i.e., TaGRP2, CDCP, and Wcor410c in wheat leaves. Virus-induced gene silencing indicated that three genes TaGRP2, CDCP, and Wcor410c were involved in modulating osmotic-cold stress in common wheat. Our study provides useful information for the elucidation of molecular and genetics bases of osmotic-cold combined stress in bread wheat.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a disorder of unknown etiology characterized by widespread, chronic abdominal pain associated with altered bowel movements. Increasing amounts of evidence indicate that stressors presented during gestational periods could have long-term effects on the offspring's tissue structure and function, which may predispose to gastrointestinal diseases. The aim of the present study is to determine whether prenatal maternal stressis a adverse factor affecting gastrointestinal sensitivity and to investigate possible mechanisms underlying prenatal maternal stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity in adult offspring. Prenatal maternal stress was induced in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats by exposure to heterotypic intermitent stress from gestational day 7 to delivery. Prenatal maternal stress significantly increased visceromotor response to colorectal distention in adult offspring from the age of 6 weeks to 10 weeks. Prenatal maternal stress also enhanced neuronal excitability including depolarization of resting membrane potentials, reduction in rheobase, and an increase in the number of action potentials evoked by 2× and 3× rheobase current stimultion of colon-specific dorsal root ganglion neurons. Prenatal maternal stress remarkably enhanced expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase and Nav1.7 in T13-L2 thoracolumbar dorsal root ganglions both at protein and mRNA levels. Intraperitoneal injection of aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of cystathionine-ß-synthase, attenuated prenatal maternal stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. A consecutive seven-day administration of aminooxyacetic acid reversed the hyperexcitability of colon-specific dorsal root ganglion neurons and markedly reduced Nav1.7 expression. These results indicate that the presence of multiple psychophysical stressors during pregnancy is associated with visceral hypersensitivity in offspring, which is likely mediated by an upregualtion of cystathionine-ß-synthase and Nav1.7 expression. Prenatal maternal stress might be a significant contributor to irritable bowel syndrome, and cystathionine-ß-synthase might be a potential target for treatment for chronic visceral hypersensitivity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

Cysteine is a nonessential amino acid in poultry nutrition. Poultry diets are deficient in cysteine, but the bird's cysteine need is met through the transsulfuration pathway (TSP) where homocysteine is converted to cysteine: a process catalyzed by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). Cysteine is also a major component of keratinized protein found in feathers, but the extent to which cysteine is involved in feather and skin development in poultry is unknown. We randomly assigned chicks to control and treatment (control diet plus 100<U+2009>mg/kg body weight of propargylglycine which is an inhibitor of CTH) diets. The thickness of skin layers, primary feather follicle parameters, growth, and mRNA expression of CBS and CTH were measured. Inhibition of TSP corresponded with the upregulation of liver mRNA of both CBS and CTH and reduction in growth from 35 to 40 days of age. The epidermis thickness, feather follicle length, and diameter were reduced from 10 to 40 days of age. Incorporation of cysteine into keratinized protein may be more sensitive to the level of available cysteine than into nonkeratinized proteins. Thus, disruption of the TSP could affect the thermoregulatory ability of the bird.

Despite huge advances in lung cancer treatment, resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains one of the major obstacles, and the elucidation of cisplatin resistance remains challenging. As an important biological and pharmacological mediator, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) performs a variety of homeostatic functions related to cancer formation and development. However, the effects of H2S on cisplatin-resistance lung cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects and relevant mechanisms of NaHS (an exogenous donor of H2S) on A549/DDP cells (cisplatin-resistant). The intracellular H2S was first evaluated using a fluorescence probe in A549 (cisplatin-sensitive) and A549/DDP cells. We found that H2S production was markedly decreased in A549/DDP cells compared with that in A549 cells, accomplished by the downregulation of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), an endogenous H2S-producing enzyme. In view of these findings, we then observed the effects of NaHS treatment on A549/DDP cells. The results showed that NaHS exposure exhibited an inhibitory effect on cell viability and the IC50 of cisplatin in A549/DDP cells decreased markedly during NaHS treatment (800 µmol/l). In addition, our data revealed that NaHS treatment of A549/DDP cells resulted in the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Finally, we demonstrated that the marked changes in the A549/DDP cell response to NaHS may be triggered by the activation of p53, and overexpression of p21, caspase-3, Bax and MMP-2, as well as the downregulation of Bcl-xL. The findings of the present study provide novel evidence that NaHS administration may represent a new strategy for the treatment of cisplatin-resistant lung cancer.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder and the quintessential disorder of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) dysregulation. Loss of either causative gene, TSC1 or TSC2, leads to constitutive mTORC1 kinase activation and a pathologically anabolic state of macromolecular biosynthesis. Little is known about the organ-specific metabolic reprogramming that occurs in TSC-affected organs. Using a mouse model of TSC in which Tsc2 is disrupted in radial glial precursors and their neuronal and glial descendants, we performed an unbiased metabolomic analysis of hippocampi to identify Tsc2-dependent metabolic changes. Significant metabolic reprogramming was found in well-established pathways associated with mTORC1 activation, including redox homeostasis, glutamine/tricarboxylic acid cycle, pentose and nucleotide metabolism. Changes in two novel pathways were identified: transmethylation and polyamine metabolism. Changes in transmethylation included reduced methionine, cystathionine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-the major methyl donor), reduced SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio (cellular methylation potential), and elevated betaine, an alternative methyl donor. These changes were associated with alterations in SAM-dependent methylation pathways and expression of the enzymes methionine adenosyltransferase 2A and cystathionine beta synthase. We also found increased levels of the polyamine putrescine due to increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-determining enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Treatment of Tsc2+/- mice with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor a-difluoromethylornithine, to reduce putrescine synthesis dose-dependently reduced hippocampal astrogliosis. These data establish roles for SAM-dependent methylation reactions and polyamine metabolism in TSC neuropathology. Importantly, both pathways are amenable to nutritional or pharmacologic therapy.

Three index patients with hyperhomocysteinemia and ocular anomalies were screened for cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms. Genotyping of hyperhomocysteinemia associated MTHFR polymorphisms C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Sanger sequencing was performed for CBS exonic sequences along with consensus splice sites. In the case of MTHFR polymorphisms, all the patients were heterozygous CT for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C677T and were therefore carriers of the risk allele (T), while the patients were homozygous CC for the risk genotype of the SNP A1298C. CBS sequencing resulted in the identification of two novel mutations, a missense change (c.467T&gt;C; p.Leu156Pro) in exon 7 and an in-frame deletion (c.808_810del; p.Glu270del) in exon 10. In addition, a recurrent missense mutation (c.770C&gt;T; p.Thr257Met) in exon 10 of the gene was also identified. The mutations were present homozygously in the patients and were inherited from the carrier parents. This is the first report from Pakistan where novel as well as recurrent CBS mutations causing hyperhomocysteinemia and lens dislocation in three patients from different families are being reported with the predicted effect of the risk allele of the MTHFR SNP in causing hyperhomocysteinemia.

Selenoprotein P (SelenoP) functions as a plasma transporter of selenium (Se) from liver to other tissues via incorporation into multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues. Selenocysteine lyase (Scly) is an intracellular enzyme that decomposes Sec into selenide, providing Se for the synthesis of new selenoproteins. Both SelenoP and Scly are mostly produced by the liver. Previous studies demonstrated that male mice lacking SelenoP (SelenoP KO) or Scly (Scly KO) had increased or decreased total hepatic Se, respectively. While SelenoP regulation by Se is well-studied, Scly regulation by Se has not been reported. We hypothesize that Scly is negatively regulated by Se levels, and that absence of SelenoP jeopardizes Scly-dependent Se recycling. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we unveiled a tissue-specific Se regulation of Scly gene expression. We also determined that SelenoP, a considered source of intracellular Se, affects Scly expression and activity in vitro but not in vivo, as in the absence of SelenoP, Scly levels and activity remain normal. We also showed that absence of SelenoP does not increase levels of transsulfuration pathway enzymes, which would result in available selenocompounds being decomposed by the actions of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL or CTH) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Instead, it affects levels of thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1), an enzyme that can reduce selenite to selenide to be used in selenoprotein production. This study evaluates a potential interplay between SelenoP and Scly, providing further insights into the regulation of selenium metabolism.

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a thiol group containing the amino acid, which naturally occurs in all humans. Hcy is degraded in the body through two metabolic pathways, while a minor part is excreted through kidneys. The chemical reactions that are necessary for degradation of Hcy require the presence of folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12. Consequently, the level of the total Hcy in the serum is influenced by the presence or absence of these vitamins. An elevated level of the Hcy, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and homocystinuria is connected with occlusive artery disease, especially in the brain, the heart, and the kidney, in addition to venous thrombosis, chronic renal failure, megaloblastic anemia, osteoporosis, depression, Alzheimer's disease, pregnancy problems, and others. Elevated Hcy levels are connected with various pathologies both in adult and child population. Causes of HHcy include genetic mutations and enzyme deficiencies in 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) methionine synthase (MS), and cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS). HHcy can be caused by deficiencies in the folate, vitamin B12 and to a lesser extent, deficiency in B6 vitamin what influences methionine metabolism. Additionally, HHcy can be caused by the rich diet and renal impairment. This review presents literature data from recent research related to Hcy metabolism and the etiology of the Hcy blood level disorder. In addition, we also described various pathological mechanisms induced by hereditary disturbances or nutritional influences and their association with HHcy induced pathology in adults and children and treatment of these metabolic disorders.

AIMS: PEGylated human truncated cystathionine beta-synthase, lacking the C-terminal regulatory domain (PEG-CBS), is a promising preclinical candidate for enzyme replacement therapy in homocystinuria (HCU). It was designed to function as a metabolic sink to decrease the severely elevated plasma and tissue homocysteine concentrations. In this communication, we evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and sub-chronic toxicity of PEG-CBS in homocystinuric mice, wild type rats and monkeys to estimate the minimum human efficacious dose for clinical trials.MAIN METHODS: Animal models received single or multiple doses of PEG-CBS. Activity of PEG-CBS and sulfur amino acid metabolites were determined in plasma and used to determine PK and PD.KEY FINDINGS: The plasma half-lives of PEG-CBS after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection were approximately 20, 44 and 73<U+202F>h in mouse, rat and monkey, respectively. The SC administration of PEG-CBS resulted in a significant improvement or full correction of metabolic imbalance in both blood and tissues of homocystinuric mice. The PD of PEG-CBS in mouse was dose-dependent, but less than dose-proportional, with the maximal efficacy achieved at 8<U+202F>mg/kg. PEG-CBS was well-tolerated in mice and monkeys, but resulted in dose-dependent minimal-to-moderate inflammation at the injection sites and vacuolated macrophages in rats. Allometric scaling of animal data was linear and the estimated human efficacious dose was determined as 0.66<U+202F>mg/kg administered once a week.SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide critical preclinical data for the design of first-in-human PEG-CBS clinical trial.

Deregulation of mitochondrial morphogenesis, a dynamic equilibrium between mitochondrial fusion and fission processes, is now evolving as a key metabolic event that fuels tumor growth and therapy resistance. However, fundamental knowledge underpinning how cancer cells reprogram mitochondrial morphogenesis remains incomplete. Here, we report that cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) reprograms mitochondrial morphogenesis in ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells by selectively regulating the stability of mitofusin 2 (MFN2). Clinically, high expression of both CBS and MFN2 implicates poor overall survival of OvCa patients, and a significant association between CBS and MFN2 expression exists in individual patients in the same data set. The silencing of CBS by small interfering RNA or inhibition of its catalytic activity by a small molecule inhibitor creates oxidative stress that activates JNK. Activated JNK phosphorylates MFN2 to recruit homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus' domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase for its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Supplementation with hydrogen sulfide or glutathione (the catalytic products of CBS enzymatic activity), anti-oxidants, or a JNK inhibitor restores MFN2 expression. In CBS-silenced orthotopic xenograft tumor tissues, MFN2 but not MFN1 is selectively downregulated. In summary, this report reveals a role for deregulated mitochondrial morphogenesis in OvCa, suggests one of the mechanisms for this deregulation, and provides a way to correct it through modulation of the metabolic enzyme CBS.-Chakraborty, P. K., Murphy, B., Mustafi, S. B., Dey, A., Xiong, X., Rao, G., Naz, S., Zhang, M., Yang, D., Dhanasekaran, D. N., Bhattacharya, R., Mukherjee, P.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains have been identified in a wide range of proteins of unrelated functions such as, metabolic enzymes, kinases and channels, and usually occur as tandem re-peats, often in combination with other domains. In plants, CBS Domain-Containing Proteins (CDCPs) form a multi-gene family and only a few are so far been reported to have a role in development via regu-lation of thioredoxin system as well as in abiotic and biotic stress response. However, the function of majority of CDCPs still remains to be elucidated in plants. Here, we report the cloning, characterization and functional validation of a CBS domain containing protein, OsCBSCBSPB4 from rice, which pos-sesses two CBS domains and one PB1 domain. We show that OsCBSCBSPB4 encodes a nucleo-cytoplasmic protein whose expression is induced in response to various abiotic stress conditions in salt-sensitive IR64 and salt-tolerant Pokkali rice cultivars. Further, heterologous expression of OsCBSCB-SPB4 in E. coli and tobacco confers marked tolerance against various abiotic stresses. Transgenic tobac-co seedlings over-expressing OsCBSCBSPB4 were found to exhibit better growth in terms of delayed leaf senescence, profuse root growth and increased biomass in contrast to the wild-type seedlings when subjected to salinity, dehydration, oxidative and extreme temperature treatments. Yeast-two hybrid stud-ies revealed that OsCBSCBSPB4 interacts with various proteins. Of these, some are known to be in-volved in abiotic stress tolerance. Our results suggest that OsCBSCBSPB4 is involved in abiotic stress response and is a potential candidate for raising multiple abiotic stress tolerant plants.

Apoptosis plays pivotal role in the pathogenesis of degenerative disc diseases, which is the primary contributor to low back pain. Although the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in cell apoptosis is well appreciated, the effects and mechanism that H2S regulates the program death of intervertebral disc cell are not yet elucidated. In this study, we utilized the nucleus pulposus (NP) from patients with lumbar disc herniation to investigate the relationship between endogenous H2S and NP cells apoptosis in human. Furthermore, we analyzed primary rat NP cells to study the effects of exogenous H2S on hypoxia induced cell apoptosis. Human NP samples were obtained from patients with lumbar disc herniation and were divided into uncontained and contained herniation groups. Using immunohistochemistry staining and sulphur-sensitive electrode, we detected the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), as well as the production of endogenous H2S in human NP. Tunel staining showed increased apoptosis in NP from herniated disc; and there was significant correlation between H2S generation and apoptosis in human NP. CoCl2 was then used to induce hypoxia in cultured primary rat NP cells. Annexin V staining indicated that exogenous NaHS attenuated hypoxia induced apoptosis in rat NP cells. Furthermore, hypoxia significantly increased the levels of multiple apoptosis associated proteins (Fas, Cytochromes C, Caspase 9 and cleaved-Caspase-3) in cells, which were eliminated by NaHS. Our study demonstrates the presence of endogenous H2S in human intervertebral disc; and the endogenous H2S generation rate is associated with NP apoptosis in herniated disc. In vitro study showes exogenous H2S donor attenuates hypoxia induced apoptosis in primary rat NP cells. Thus, our work provides insights that H2S may have beneficial effects in treating degenerative disc diseases.

The equilibrium between C2'- and C3'-endo conformations of nucleotides in solution, as well as their polymers DNA and RNA, has been well studied in previous work. However, this equilibrium of nucleotides in their binding state remains unclear. We observed two AMP molecules, in C3'- and C2'-endo conformations respectively, simultaneously bound to a cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) domain dimer of the magnesium and cobalt efflux protein CorC in the crystallographic study. The C2'-endo AMP molecule assumes the higher sugar pucker energy and one more hydrogen bond with the protein than the C3'-endo molecule does. The balance between the high sugar pucker energy and the low binding energy suggests an equilibrium or switch between C2'- and C3'-endo conformations of the bound nucleotides. Our work challenge the previous hypothesis that the ribose of the bound nucleotides would be locked in a fixed conformation.

Elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels have been reported to be involved in liver injury, and autophagy plays an important role in normal hepatic physiology and pathophysiology, but the mechanism underlying Hcy regulated autophagy is currently unknown. In this study, CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice were fed with regular diet for 12 weeks to establish a hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) model and HL-7702 cells were treated with Hcy, we found that Hcy increases autophagy and aggravates liver injury by downregulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of CFTR inhibited the formation of autophagosomes and the expression of autophagy-related proteins BECN1, LC3-II/I and Atg12, while the expression of p62 increased in Hcy-treated hepatocytes and CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice injected with lentivirus expressing CFTR. Further study showed that CFTR expression is regulated by the interaction of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which, respectively, regulate DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). In conclusion, our study showed that Hcy activates autophagy by inhibition of CFTR expression via interaction between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in the mouse liver. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of Hcy-induced autophagy in liver injury.

Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) belongs to a large family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, responsible for the sulfur metabolism. The heme-dependent protein CBS is part of regulatory pathways also involving the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide. Malfunction of CBS can lead to pathologic conditions like cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Truncation of residues 1-40, absent in X-ray structures of CBS, reduces but does not abolish the activity of the enzyme. Here we report the NMR resonance assignment and heme interaction studies for the N-terminal peptide stretch of CBS. We present NMR-spectral evidence that residues 1-40 constitute an intrinsically disordered region in CBS and interact with heme via a cysteine-proline based motif.

Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is the most common inherited disorder of sulfur amino acid metabolism caused by deficiency in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity and characterized by severe elevation of homocysteine in blood and tissues. Treatment with dietary methionine restriction is not optimal, and poor compliance leads to serious complications. We developed an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and studied its efficacy in a severe form of HCU in mouse (the I278T model). Treatment was initiated before or after the onset of clinical symptoms in an effort to prevent or reverse the phenotype. ERT substantially reduced and sustained plasma homocysteine concentration at around 100 µM and normalized plasma cysteine for up to 9 months of treatment. Biochemical balance was also restored in the liver, kidney, and brain. Furthermore, ERT corrected liver glucose and lipid metabolism. The treatment prevented or reversed facial alopecia, fragile and lean phenotype, and low bone mass. In addition, structurally defective ciliary zonules in the eyes of I278T mice contained low density and/or broken fibers, while administration of ERT from birth partially rescued the ocular phenotype. In conclusion, ERT maintained an improved metabolic pattern and ameliorated many of the clinical complications in the I278T mouse model of HCU.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), the key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, links methionine metabolism to the biosynthesis of cellular redox controlling molecules. CBS catalyzes the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine, which is subsequently converted into cysteine. Besides maintaining cellular sulfur amino acid homeostasis, CBS also catalyzes multiple hydrogen sulfide-generating reactions using cysteine and homocysteine as substrates. In mammals, CBS is activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), where it can adopt two different conformations (basal and activated), but exists as a unique highly active species in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present the crystal structure of CBS from honeybey Apis mellifera, which shows a constitutively active dimeric species and let explain why the enzyme is not allosterically regulated by AdoMet. In addition, comparison of available CBS structures unveils a substrate-induced closure of the catalytic cavity, which in humans is affected by the AdoMet-dependent regulation and likely impaired by the homocystinuria causing mutation T191M.

Hydrogen sulfide is produced from l-cysteine by the action of both cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and increasingly has been found to play a profound regulatory role in a range of physiological processes. Mounting evidence suggests that upregulation of hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis occurs in several disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, ischemic injury, and sleep-disordered breathing. In addition to being critical tools in our understanding of hydrogen sulfide biology, inhibitors of CSE hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases in which increased levels of this gasotransmitter play a role. We describe the discovery and development of a novel series of potent CSE inhibitors that show increased activity over the benchmark inhibitor and, importantly, display high selectivity for CSE versus CBS.

Chorionic NAD-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) plays a pivotal role in controlling the amount of prostaglandins in the uterus and has been implicated in the process of labor. Prior studies identified hydrogen sulfide-generating enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in fetal membranes. We investigated whether hydrogen sulfide is involved in the regulation of PGDH expression in the chorion during labor. The chorionic tissues were obtained from pregnant women at preterm in labor and at term in labor or not in labor at term. Levels of CSE and CBS and hydrogen sulfide production rate were down-regulated in term in labor and preterm in labor groups compared with not in labor at term group. The CBS level correlated to PGDH expression in the chorion. Hydrogen sulfide donor NaHS and precursor l-cysteine dose-dependently stimulated PGDH expression and activity in cultured chorionic trophoblasts. The effect of l-cysteine was blocked by CBS inhibitor and CBS siRNA but not by CSE inhibitor and CSE siRNA. Hydrogen sulfide treatment suppressed miR-26b and miR-199a expression in chorionic trophoblasts. miR-26b and miR-199a mimics blocked hydrogen sulfide upregulation of PGDH expression. Our results indicate that hydrogen sulfide plays pivotal roles in maintenance of PGDH expression in the chorion during human pregnancy. Reduced expression of hydrogen sulfide-generating enzymes contributes to an increased amount of prostaglandins in the uterus during labor.

OBJECTIVES: To observe the changes of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) expression in the cerebral cortex after brain contusion at different times.METHODS: An experimental model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice was established by an improved weight-drop device. Then Western blotting and immunohistochemical examination were used to detect the CBS expression in cerebral cortex around injury at different time points (1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, 7 d).RESULTS: The results of Western blotting revealed that the expression level of CBS was down-regulated and reached its lowest level at the 3rd days after injury, and then restored to normal level after 7 days. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that CBS was present in the normal brain cortex. CBS expression gradually decreased at the 3rd days after injury, and then restored to normal level after 7 days.CONCLUSIONS: CBS has the potential to be a reference index for time estimation after brain contusion in forensic practice.

Zinc plays a role in alleviating oxidative stress. However, the related mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. The present study was conducted to investigate whether the recovery of oxidative stress in high-fat-diet (HFD)-pretreated mice was affected by zinc. Male mice received either an HFD or a low-fat-diet (LFD) for 8 weeks. Then, the mice fed with HFD and LFD were both assigned to either a control diet (30 mg zinc, ZD) or a no-added zinc diet (NZD) for an additional 4 weeks. The results showed that after feeding with NZD for 4 weeks, the HFD-pretreated mice had the highest plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, while had the lowest CuZn-SOD and glutathione concentrations. Moreover, after feeding with NZD for 4 weeks, the HFD-pretreated mice had the highest hepatic ROS and homocysteine concentrations, while had the lowest glutathione and methionine concentrations. Furthermore, the HFD-pretreated mice fed with NZD for 4 weeks had the lowest gene and protein expression of betaine homocysteine-S-methyltransferase (BHMT), cystathionine ß-synthase, and Sp1. The results suggested that zinc was critical for oxidative stress alleviation and homocysteine clearance in HFD-pretreated mice. It was further elucidated that improved Sp1 and BHMT expression are involved in the effects of zinc on oxidative stress.

Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is the most common loss-of-function inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism. HCU is caused by a deficiency in enzymatic degradation of homocysteine, a toxic intermediate of methionine transformation to cysteine, chiefly due to missense mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. As with many other inherited disorders, the pathogenic mutations do not target key catalytic residues, but rather introduce structural perturbations leading to an enhanced tendency of the mutant CBS to misfold and either to form nonfunctional aggregates or to undergo proteasome-dependent degradation. Correction of CBS misfolding would represent an alternative therapeutic approach for HCU. In this review, we summarize the complex nature of CBS, its multi-domain architecture, the interplay between the three cofactors required for CBS function [heme, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)], as well as the intricate allosteric regulatory mechanism only recently understood, thanks to advances in CBS crystallography. While roughly half of the patients respond to treatment with a PLP precursor pyridoxine, many studies suggested usefulness of small chemicals, such as chemical and pharmacological chaperones or proteasome inhibitors, rescuing mutant CBS activity in cellular and animal models of HCU. Non-specific chemical chaperones and proteasome inhibitors assist in mutant CBS folding process and/or prevent its rapid degradation, thus resulting in increased steady-state levels of the enzyme and CBS activity. Recent interest in the field and available structural information will hopefully yield CBS-specific compounds, by using high-throughput screening and computational modeling of novel ligands, improving folding, stability, and activity of CBS mutants.

Cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient homocystinuria (HCU) is a poorly understood, life-threatening inborn error of sulfur metabolism. Analysis of hepatic glutathione (GSH) metabolism in a mouse model of HCU demonstrated significant depletion of cysteine, GSH, and GSH disulfide independent of the block in trans-sulfuration compared with wild-type controls. HCU induced the expression of the catalytic and regulatory subunits of <U+03B3>-glutamyl ligase, GSH synthase (GS), <U+03B3>-glutamyl transpeptidase 1, 5-oxoprolinase (OPLAH), and the GSH-dependent methylglyoxal detoxification enzyme, glyoxalase-1. Multiple components of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant-response regulatory axis were induced without any detectable activation of Nrf2. Metabolomic analysis revealed the accumulation of multiple <U+03B3>-glutamyl amino acids and that plasma ophthalmate levels could serve as a noninvasive marker for hepatic redox stress. Neither cysteine, nor betaine treatment was able to reverse the observed enzyme inductions. Taurine treatment normalized the expression levels of <U+03B3>-glutamyl ligase C/M, GS, OPLAH, and glyoxalase-1, and reversed HCU-induced deficits in protein glutathionylation by acting to double GSH levels relative to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that the perturbation of the <U+03B3>-glutamyl cycle could contribute to multiple sequelae in HCU and that taurine has significant therapeutic potential for both HCU and other diseases for which GSH depletion is a critical pathogenic factor.-Maclean, K.

Hyper- and hypothyroidism are some of the most common endocrinopathies that cause many metabolic disorders including amino acids metabolism. However, a specific molecular mechanism of thyroid hormones influence on sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism has not been established. The aim of our research was to investigate experimentally the influence of thyroid gland functional state on the main enzymatic systems of sulphur-containing amino acids metabolism in liver and kidneys, the content of homocysteine, cysteine and H2S in blood. The rats were administered with L-thyroxine and mercazolil to simulate the states of hyper- and hypothyroidism, which were confirmed by the content of fT3, fT4 and TSH in the blood. In liver and kidneys of the animals with hypothyroidism we observed the decrease in the activity of enzymes of remethylation cycle of S-adenosylmethioninsyntase, S-adenosylhomocysteinhyhdrolase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. Suppression of transsulfuration transformation of homocysteine to cysteine in hypothyroidism was mainly due to the inhibition of cystathionine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase, wherein cystathionase activity of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase was not changed. In animals with hypothyroidism we also noticed the inhibition of cysteine desulfunation reactions: the activity of enzymes of cystathionine-ß-synthase, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase and cysteine aminotransferase significantly decreased in liver and kidneys. Experimental hyperthyroidism was accompanied by increase in activity of remethylation cycle enzymes, increase in cystationine synthase activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase in liver and activity of these enzymes in kidneys. The simulation of hyperthyroidism led to the decrease of homocysteine concentration, and of hypothyroidism - to the increase of homocysteine and cysteine concentrations and reduced H2S content in blood of the animals. Thus, the significant risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulation in hypothyroid conditions may be the disorders in the processes of remethylation, transsulfuration, and desulfuration of sulphur-containing amino acids in organs.

Skeletal and connective tissue defects are the most striking symptoms in patients suffering from classical homocystinuria (HCU). Here, we determined body composition and bone mass in three mouse models of HCU and assessed whether a long-term administration of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) corrected the phenotype. The mouse models of HCU were analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the data were complemented by plasma biochemical profiles. Both the mouse model lacking CBS (KO) and the one expressing human CBS mutant transgene on a mouse CBS null background (I278T) showed marked bone loss and decreased weight mostly due to a lower fat content compared with negative controls. In contrast, the HO mouse expressing the human CBS WT transgene on a mouse CBS null background showed no such phenotype despite similar plasma biochemical profile to the KO and I278T mice. More importantly, administration of ERT rescued bone mass and changes in body composition in the KO mice treated since birth and reversed bone loss and improved fat content in the I278T mice injected after the development of clinical symptoms. Our study suggests that ERT for HCU may represent an effective way of preventing the skeletal problems in patients without a restricted dietary regime.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the result and follow-up data of screening for newborn amino acid metabolic disorders in Zhejiang province.METHODS: A total of 1 861 262 newborns were screened for amino acid metabolic disorders during January 2009 and December 2016 in Zhejiang province. The screening results and the follow-up data were analyzed retrospectively.RESULTS: One hundred and sixty four cases were diagnosed as amino acid metabolic disorders with a prevalence of 1:11 349, including 83 with hyperphenylalaninaemia (1:22 400), 29 with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (1:64 138), 16 with methionine S-adenosyltransferase deficiency (1:116 250), 9 with maple syrup urine disease (1:206 667), 8 with argininemia (1:232 500), 7 with citrullinemia type <U+2160> (1:265 700), 6 with hyperprolinemia type <U+2160> (1:310 000), and 2 with carbamylphosphate synthetase <U+2160> deficiency(1:930 000). In addition, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency, argininosucoinate aciduria and tyrosinemia type <U+2160> were detected in one patient for each, respectively. Two patients had developmental delay, 7 patients were dead, and 2 cases of maple syrup urine disease were lost to follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Hyperphenylalaninaemia is the most common amino acid metabolic disease in newborns in Zhejiang province. Patients with amino acid metabolic disorders identified in newborn screening program can have chance for normal growth development by intervention.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains discovered 20 years ago can bind different adenosine derivatives (AMP, ADP, ATP, S-adenosylmethionine, NAD, diadenosine polyphosphates) and thus regulate the activities of numerous proteins. Mutations in CBS domains of enzymes and membrane transporters are associated with several hereditary diseases. The regulatory unit is a quartet of CBS domains that belong to one or two polypeptides and usually form a conserved disk-like structure. CBS domains function as &quot;internal inhibitors&quot; in enzymes, and their bound ligands either amplify or attenuate the inhibitory effect. Recent studies have opened a way to understanding the structural basis of enzyme regulation via CBS domains and widened the list of their bound ligands.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mainly synthesized by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH), has been implicated in regulating placental angiogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This study was to test a hypothesis that trophoblasts synthesize H2S to promote placental angiogenesis. Human choriocarcinoma-derived BeWo cells expressed both CBS and CTH proteins, while the first trimester villous trophoblast-originated HTR-8/SVneo cells expressed CTH protein only. The H2S producing ability of BeWo cells was significantly inhibited by either inhibitors of CBS (carboxymethyl hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride, CHH) or CTH (ß-cyano-L-alanine, BCA) and that in HTR-8/SVneo cells was inhibited by CHH only. H2S donors stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in ovine placental artery endothelial cells (oFPAECs) as effectively as vascular endothelial growth factor. Co-culture with BeWo and HTR-8/SVneo cells stimulated oFPAEC migration, which was inhibited by CHH or BCA in BeWo but CHH only in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Primary human villous trophoblasts (HVT) were more potent than trophoblast cell lines in stimulating oFPAEC migration that was inhibited by CHH and CHH/BCA combination in accordance with its H2S synthesizing activity linked to CBS and CTH expression patterns. H2S donors activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), and extracellular signal-activated kinase 1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1, MAPK3/1) in oFPAECs. H2S donor-induced NOS3 activation was blocked by AKT1 but not MAPK3/1 inhibition. In keeping with our previous studies showing a crucial role of AKT1, MAPK3/1, and NOS3/NO in placental angiogenesis, these data show that trophoblast-derived endogenous H2S stimulates placental angiogenesis, involving activation of AKT1, NOS3/NO, and MAPK3/1.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is associated with primary causes of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. Several studies have been carried out to evaluate the effects of a diet inducing cystathionine-ß-synthase, methyltetrafolate, folic acid, and vitamin B supplemented with methionine on the homocysteine metabolism and in lowering the plasma total homocysteine levels. A large number of molecular and biomedical studies in numerous animals, such as mice, rabbits, and pigs, have sought to elevate the plasma total homocysteine levels and to identify a disease model for human hyperhomocysteinemia. However, a specific animal model is not suitable for hyperhomocysteinemia in terms of all aspects of cardiovascular disease. In this review article, the experimental progress of animal models with plasma total homocysteine levels is examined to identify a feasible animal model of hyperhomocysteinemia for different aspects.

This study examined the molecular mechanisms of methionine pathways in meat-type chickens where birds were provided with a diet deficient in methionine from 3 to 5 weeks of age. The birds on the deficient diet were then provided with a diet supplemented with either D,L-methionine or D,L-HMTBA from 5 to 7 weeks. The diet of the control birds was supplemented with L-methionine from hatch till 7 weeks of age. We studied the mRNA expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1, alpha, methionine adenosyltransferase 1, beta, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, glycine N-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase and cystathionine beta synthase genes in the liver, duodenum, Pectoralis (P.) major and the gastrocnemius muscle at 5 and 7 weeks. Feeding a diet deficient in dietary methionine affected body composition. Birds that were fed a methionine-deficient diet expressed genes that indicated that remethylation occurred via the one-carbon pathway in the liver and duodenum; however, in the P. major and the gastrocnemius muscles, gene expression levels suggested that homocysteine received methyl from both folate and betaine for remethylation. Birds who were switched from a methionine deficiency diet to one supplemented with either D,L-methionine or D,L-HMTBA showed a downregulation of all the genes studied in the liver. However, depending on the tissue or methionine form, either folate or betaine was elicited for remethylation. Thus, mRNA expressions show that genes in the remethylation and transsulphuration pathways were regulated according to tissue need, and there were some differences in the methionine form.

Anticoagulant therapy is prescribed to millions of patients worldwide for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis. Evidence has indicated that edoxaban is a potential drug of oral anticoagulant in the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism. Hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine plasma concentration are indicators of cardiovascular and neurovascular disease risk factors that have attracted considerable attention for regulation of vascular health and homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanism of edoxaban-mediated differences of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine has not been investigated in the progression of venous thrombosis. In the present study, the authors analyzed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in the vein endothelial cells and expression levels of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine. Homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism through transsulfuration and that transsulfuration capacity and hydrogen sulfide availability have been investigated both in vitro and in vivo following treatment with edoxaban. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) levels were studied in a cell model and rat model of vein thrombosis prior and post treatment of edoxaban. The therapeutic effects of edoxaban for rats with vein thrombosis were determined by clinical diagnose scores. The results demonstrated that edoxaban increased expression levels of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine in microvascular endothelial cells. It was observed that the transsulfuration enzymes, CBS and CGL levels were upregulated in murine microvascular endothelial cells. The MMP-9 expression level and activity and homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism were increased in murine microvascular endothelial cells following edoxaban treatment. In addition, CBS and CGL activities were upregulated in murine microvascular endothelial cells and a rat model of venous thrombosis following treatment with edoxaban. Furthermore, it was observed that edoxaban increased PI3K and AKT expression both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, edoxaban significantly improved endothelial injury and inhibited thrombosis factors expression in rat model of venous thrombosis. In conclusion, these findings suggested that edoxaban can improve venous thrombosis by decreasing hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with several human visual disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is linked to vision loss in DR and AMD. Our previous work revealed that HHcy altered BRB in retinal endothelial cells in vivo. Here we hypothesize that homocysteine (Hcy) alters retinal endothelial cell barrier function and angiogenic potential via activation of oxidative stress. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) treated with and without different concentrations of Hcy showed a reduction of tight junction protein expression, increased FITC dextran leakage, decreased transcellular electrical resistance and increased angiogenic potential. In addition, HRECs treated with Hcy showed increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduced ROS formation and decreased FITC-dextran leakage in Hcy treated HRECs. A mouse model of HHcy, in which cystathionine-ß-synthase is deficient (cbs <sup>-/-</sup>), was evaluated for oxidative stress by dichlolorofluorescein (DCF), dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. There was a marked increase in ROS production and augmented GSH reductase and antioxidant regulator NRF2 activity, but decreased antioxidant gene expression in retinas of hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Our results suggest activation of oxidative stress as a possible mechanism of HHcy induced retinal endothelial cell dysfunction.

Protein-depleted states generate allosteric inhibition of liver cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), which governs the first enzymatic step of the transsulfuration cascade, resulting in upstream accretion of homocysteine (Hcy) in body fluids. A similar Hcy increase may arise from normal hepatocytes undergoing experimentally-induced impairment of betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHTM) activity or from components of lean body mass (LBM) submitted to any inflammatory disorder. LBM comprises a composite agglomeration of extrarenal tissues characterized by naturally occurring BHTM inactivity. As a result of cellular injury, LBM releases high concentrations of Hcy into the extracellular space, contrasting with the disruption of normal remethylation pathways. Hyperhomocysteinemia acts as a biomarker, reflecting the severity of insult and operating as an alarm signal. Elevated Hcy levels constitute a precursor pool recognized by a CBS coding region that reacts to meet increased methionine requirements in LBM tissues, using its enhanced production in hepatocytes. Preservation of methionine homeostasis benefits from its high metabolic priority and survival value.

Drug resistance is a major impediment to effective treatment of breast cancer. Compared to normal cells, cancer cells have an increased antioxidant potential due to an increased ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG). This is known to confer therapeutic resistance. Here, we have identified a mechanism, unique to breast cancer cells, whereby cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) promotes elevated GSH/GSSG. Lentiviral silencing of CBS in human breast cancer cells attenuated GSH/GSSG, total GSH, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and processes downstream of Nrf2 that promote GSH synthesis and regeneration of GSH from GSSG. Carbon monoxide (CO) reduced GSH/GSSG in three breast cancer cell lines by inhibiting CBS. Furthermore, CO sensitized breast cancer cells to doxorubicin. These results provide insight into mechanism(s) by which CBS increases the antioxidant potential and the ability for CO to inhibit CBS activity to alter redox homeostasis in breast cancer, increasing sensitivity to a chemotherapeutic.

Congenital heart defects are structural cardiovascular malformations that arise from abnormal formation of the heart or major blood vessels during the fetal period. To investigate the association of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MTHFD1, eNOS, CBS and ACE genes, we evaluated their relationship with CHD in Iranian patients. In this case-control study, a total of 102 children with CHD and 98 control children were enrolled. Four SNPs including MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T, CBS C-4673G and ACE A2350G were genotyped by PCR-SSCP, Multiplex ARMS PCR and PCR-RFLP methods and confirmed by direct sequencing. We genotyped 102 patients and 98 controls for four polymorphisms by statistically analysis. There were three SNPs including MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T and ACE A2350G which might increase the risk of CHD, but CBS C-4673G was not significantly different between patients and controls. (P = 0.017, P = 0.048, P = 0.025 and P = 0.081 respectively). The allele frequencies of three SNPs for MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T and ACE A2350G in CHD are higher than that in control. Our results show that there is a significant relationship between MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T and ACE A2350G polymorphisms with CHD. Therefore, The AA and GA genotypes of MTHFD1 G1958A, TT and GT genotypes of eNOS G894T and the AA and GA genotypes of ACE A2350G are susceptible factors for CHD and may increase the risk of CHD.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the transsulfuration pathway and contributes, among other functions, to the generation of hydrogen sulfide. In view of the exceptionally high expression of CBS in the liver and the common interleukin-6 pathway used in the regulatory systems of hydrogen sulfide and hepcidin, we speculate that CBS is involved in body iron homeostasis. We found that CBS knockout (CBS<sup>-/-</sup> ) mice exhibited anemia and a significant increase in iron content in the serum, liver, spleen, and heart, along with severe damage to the liver, displaying a hemochromatosis-like phenotype. A high level of hepatic and serum hepcidin was also found. A major cause of the systemic iron overload is the reduced iron usage due to suppressed erythropoiesis, which is consistent with an increase in interleukin-6 and reduced expression of erythropoietin. Importantly, in the liver, absence of CBS caused both a reduction in the transcriptional factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and an up-regulation of hepcidin that led to a decrease in the iron export protein ferroportin 1. The resulting suppression of iron export exacerbates iron retention, causing damage to hepatocytes. Finally, administration of CBS-overexpressing adenovirus into CBS mutant mice could partially reverse the iron-related phenotype.Our findings point to a critical role of CBS in iron homeostasis of the body, and the liver in particular; it is likely that a hemochromatosis-like phenotype in patients can be induced by aberration not only in the expression of key molecules in the hepcidin pathway but also of those related to CBS. (Hepatology 2018;67:21-35).</AbstractText>: Our findings point to a critical role of CBS in iron homeostasis of the body, and the liver in particular; it is likely that a hemochromatosis-like phenotype in patients can be induced by aberration not only in the expression of key molecules in the hepcidin pathway but also of those related to CBS.

Sodium azide (NaN3) is a chemical of rapidly growing commercial importance. It is very acutely toxic and inhibits cytochrome oxidase (COX) by binding irreversibly to the heme cofactor. A previous study from our group demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator identified, had protective effects against neuronal damage induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is well-known that TBI can reduce the activity of COX and have detrimental effects on the central nervous system metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, it was hypothesized that H2S may provide neuroprotection against NaN3 toxicity. The current results revealed that NaN3 treatment induced non-apoptotic cell death, namely autophagic cell death, in PC12 cells. Expression of the endogenous H2S-producing enzymes, cystathionine-ß-synthase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, decreased in a dose-dependent manner following NaN3 treatment. Pretreatment with H2S markedly attenuated the NaN3-induced cell viability loss and autophagic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The present study suggests that H2S-based strategies may have future potential in the prevention and/or therapy of neuronal damage following NaN3 exposure.

Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is an inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism caused by deficient activity of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), resulting in an accumulation of homocysteine and a concomitant decrease of cystathionine and cysteine in blood and tissues. In mice, the complete lack of CBS is neonatally lethal. In this study, newborn CBS-knockout (KO) mice were treated with recombinant polyethyleneglycolylated human truncated CBS (PEG-CBS). Full survival of the treated KO mice, along with a positive impact on metabolite levels in plasma, liver, brain, and kidneys, was observed. The PEG-CBS treatment prevented an otherwise fatal liver disease characterized by steatosis, death of hepatocytes, and ultrastructural abnormalities of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Furthermore, treatment of the KO mice for 5 mo maintained the plasma metabolite balance and completely prevented osteoporosis and changes in body composition that characterize both the KO model and human patients. These findings argue that early treatment of patients with HCU with PEG-CBS may prevent clinical symptoms of the disease possibly without the need of dietary protein restriction.-Majtan, T., Hulková, H., Park, I., Krijt, J., Koich, V., Bublil, E.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of the rs6586282 polymorphism of the cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) gene, and of the intake of B vitamins on anthropometric parameters, tHcy levels, and lipoprotein levels in women over 60 years of age. 122 volunteers were supplemented with 400 µg/day folic acid for 8 weeks. The intake of B vitamins above the median value was associated with lower levels of blood biomarkers: folate with tHcy post supplementation (6.21 ± 0.24 µM vs 7.11 ± 0.32 µM; p &lt; 0.05), vitamin B6 with baseline triacylglycerol (TAG, 107.3 ± 5.5 mg/dL vs 127.2 ± 6.4 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.05) and glucose (82.3 ± 1.1 mg/dL vs 86.9 ± 1.5 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.05); and vitamin B12 with baseline TAG (106.8 ± 5.5 mg/dL vs 127.7 ± 6.3 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.01). Women with a T allele consuming lower amounts of folate had higher body weight (72.3 ± 2.3 kg vs 64.0 ± 1.7 kg; p &lt; 0.05), body mass index (28.7 ± 0.8 vs 25.2 ± 0.7; p &lt; 0.05), waist (0.90 ± 0.02 m vs 0.82 ± 0.01 m; p &lt; 0.01), and hip circumference (1.08 ± 0.02 vs 1.02 ± 0.01 m; p &lt; 0.01) than the CC homozygotes. Intake of vitamin B6 or B12 may infl uence blood TAG and glucose concentrations in elderly women, but the rs6586282 polymorphism of the CBS gene does not alter either tHcy or the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation. The CBS SNP at rs6586282 may infl uence anthropometric parameters, though only in case of low folate intake.

The results showed that hepatic glutathione anti-oxidant systems were impaired and reactive oxygen species and homocysteine were increased in diquat-induced mice and hepatocytes, while such disadvantageous changes were diminished by serine supplementation both in vivo and in vitro. However, when cystathionine ß-synthase expression was inhibited by interference RNA in hepatocytes, the effects of serine supplementation on the improvement of glutathione synthesis and the alleviation of oxidative stress were diminished.

AIMS: Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) is the common pathway of progressive chronic kidney disease. Inflammation has been widely accepted as the major driving force of TIF. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway. CBS is considered to play protective role in liver and pulmonary fibrosis, but its role in TIF remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role and mechanism of CBS in renal inflammation and TIF.METHODS: Renal function, tubulointerstitium damage index score, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and the expressions of collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, CD3, CD68, IL-1ß, TNF-a were measured in sham operation and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) rats. Proteomics and gene array analysis were performed to screen differentially expressed molecules in the development of renal inflammation and TIF in UUO rats. The expression of CBS was detected in patients with obstructive nephropathy and UUO rats. We confirmed the expression of CBS using western blot and real-time PCR in HK-2 cells. Overexpression plasmid and siRNA were transfected specifically to study the possible function of CBS in HK-2 cells.RESULTS: Abundant expression of CBS, localized in renal tubular epithelial cells, was revealed in human and rat renal tissue, which correlated negatively with the progression of fibrotic disease. Expression of CBS was dramatically decreased in the obstructed kidney from UUO rats as compared with the sham group (SHM). In addition, knocking down CBS exacerbated extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, whereas CBS overexpression attenuated TGF-ß1-induced ECM deposition in vitro. Inflammatory and chemotactic factors were also increased in CBS knockdown HK-2 cells stimulated by IL-1ß.CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish CBS as a novel inhibitor in renal fibrosis and as a new therapeutic target in patients with chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE: Hirschsprung associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in Hirschsprung Disease (HSCR). The pathogenesis of HAEC is poorly understood. In recent years, there is increasing evidence that a compromised intestinal barrier function plays a major role in the pathogenesis of HAEC. Hydrogen sulfide, synthesized from L-cysteine by two key enzymes, cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lysase (CSE) is reported to play a key role in regulating gastrointestinal motility and promoting resolution of inflammation. We designed this study to test the hypothesis that CBS and CSE expression is altered in the colon of patients with HSCR.METHODS: We investigated CBS and CSE protein expression in both the aganglionic and ganglionic regions of HSCR patients (n=10) versus healthy control colon (n=10). Protein distribution was assessed by using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Gene and protein expression was quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot analysis, and densitometry.MAIN RESULTS: qPCR and Western blot analysis revealed that CBS and CSE are expressed in the normal human colon. CBS and CSE expression was significantly decreased (p&lt;0.003) in the ganglionic and aganglionic bowel in HSCR compared to controls. Confocal microscopy revealed that CBS and CSE expression in smooth muscles, interstitial cells of Cajal, platelet-derived growth factor-alpha receptor-positive cells, enteric neurons and colonic epithelium was markedly decreased in HSCR specimens compared to controls.CONCLUSION: We demonstrate for the first time the expression and distribution of CBS/CSE in patients with HSCR. The observed decreased expression of CBS and CSE may affect mucosal integrity and colonic contractility and thus render HSCR patients more susceptible to develop HAEC.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, particularly during pathological processes. Experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), which is caused by vascular leakage into the brain, is characterized by inflammation, neurological deficits and cerebral hemorrhage. The present study investigated the correlation between ECM genesis and the levels of H2S. The results indicated that the levels of H2S derived from the brain decreased over time following ECM infection, and that the low H2S bioavailability was partially caused by decreased expression of the H2S generating enzyme, cystathionine-ß-synthase. Administration of NaHS (an exogenous donor of H2S) provided protection against ECM. NaHS inhibited the destruction of the blood brain barrier and the secretion of proinflammatory biomarkers, including interluekin-18, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and serum cluster of differentiation 40 into the brain during ECM. In conclusion, these results suggested that low levels of H2S in brain contributed to the progression of ECM, and that H2S donor administration may represent a potential protective therapy against ECM.

Hypoxic-ischemia stress causes severe brain injury, leading to death and disability worldwide. Although it has been reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an essential step in the progression of hypoxia or ischemia-induced brain injury, the underlying molecular mechanisms are and have not yet been fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence has indicated that both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) play an important role in the development of cerebral ischemic injury. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the association between NO signaling and the cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)/H2S system on ER stress in a cell model of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia injury. We found that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) markedly increased the NO level and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activity. 3-Bromo-7-nitroindazole (3-Br-7-NI), a relatively selective nNOS inhibitor, abolished the OGD-induced inhibition of cell viability and the increased expression of ER stress-related proteins, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase-12 in PC12 cells, indicating the contribution of excessive nNOS/NO signaling to OGD-induced ER stress. Furthermore, we found that OGD increased the phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK)/AMPK ratio, and the AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ß-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), attenuated the effects on OGD-induced ER stress, suggesting that OGD-induced NO overproduction results in AMPK activation in PC12 cells. We also found that OGD induced the downregulation of the CBS/H2S system, as indicated by the decreased H2S level in the culture supernatant and CBS activity in PC12 cells. In addition, we found that treatment with NaHS (a H2S donor) or S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, a CBS agonist) mitigated OGD-induced ER stress, as well as the NO level, nNOS activity and AMPK phosphorylation in PC12 cells. On the whole, these results suggest that the inhibition of the CBS/H2S system, which facilitated excessive nNOS/NO/AMPK activation, contributes to OGD-induced ER stress.

Cysteamine is a small aminothiol endogenously derived from coenzyme A degradation. For some decades, synthetic cysteamine has been employed for the treatment of cystinosis, and new uses of the drug continue to emerge. In this review, we discuss the role of cysteamine in cellular and extracellular homeostasis and focus on the potential use of aminothiols to reconstitute the function of proteins harboring arginine (Arg) to cysteine (Cys) mutations, via repair of the Cys residue into a moiety that introduces an amino group, as seen in basic amino acid residues Lys and Arg. Cysteamine has been utilized in vitro and ex vivo in four different genetic disorders, and thus provides &quot;proof of principle&quot; that aminothiols can modify Cys residues. Other aminothiols such as mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG) with closer structural resemblance to the guanidinium moiety of Arg are under examination for their predicted enhanced capacity to reconstitute loss of function. Although the use of aminothiols holds clinical potential, more studies are required to refine specificity and treatment design. The efficacy of aminothiols to target proteins may vary substantially depending on their specific extracellular and intracellular locations. Redox potential, pH, and specific aminothiol abundance in each physiological compartment are expected to influence the reactivity and turnover of cysteamine and analogous drugs. Upcoming research will require the use of suitable cell and animal models featuring Arg to Cys mutations. Since, in general, Arg to Cys changes comprise about 8% of missense mutations, repair of this specific mutation may provide promising avenues for many genetic diseases.

Alterations in sulfur amino acid metabolism are associated with an increased risk of a number of common late-life diseases, which raises the possibility that metabolism of sulfur amino acids may change with age. The present study was conducted to understand the age-related changes in hepatic metabolism of sulfur amino acids in 2-, 6-, 18- and 30-month-old male C57BL/6 mice. For this purpose, metabolite profiling of sulfur amino acids from methionine to taurine or glutathione (GSH) was performed. The levels of sulfur amino acids and their metabolites were not significantly different among 2-, 6- and 18-month-old mice, except for plasma GSH and hepatic homocysteine. Plasma total GSH and hepatic total homocysteine levels were significantly higher in 2-month-old mice than those in the other age groups. In contrast, 30-month-old mice exhibited increased hepatic methionine and cysteine, compared with all other groups, but decreased hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine and homocysteine, relative to 2-month-old mice. No differences in hepatic reduced GSH, GSH disulfide, or taurine were observed. The hepatic changes in homocysteine and cysteine may be attributed to upregulation of cystathionine ß-synthase and down-regulation of <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine ligase in the aged mice. The elevation of hepatic cysteine levels may be involved in the maintenance of hepatic GSH levels. The opposite changes of methionine and SAM suggest that the regulatory role of SAM in hepatic sulfur amino acid metabolism may be impaired in 30-month-old mice.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 236,200) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by mutations in the CBS gene. It is the most common inborn error of sulfur metabolism and is the cause of classical homocystinuria, a condition characterized by very high levels of plasma total homocysteine and methionine. Although recognized as an inborn error of metabolism over 60years ago, these is still much we do not understand related to how this specific metabolic defect gives rise to its distinct phenotypes. To try and answer these questions, several groups have developed mouse models on CBS deficiency. In this article, we will review various mouse models of CBS deficiency and discuss how these mouse models compare to human CBS deficient patients.

Mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene are the cause of classical homocystinuria, the most common inborn error in sulfur metabolism. The c.797 G&gt;A (p.R266K) mutation in CBS was originally described in several Norwegian pyridoxine responsive CBS deficient patients, and heterologous gene expression studies have shown that the protein has near wild-type levels of enzyme activity. Here, we characterize a transgenic mouse lacking endogenous Cbs and expressing p.R266K human CBS protein from a zinc inducible metallothionein promoter (Tg-R266K Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> ). Unlike mice expressing other mutant CBS alleles, the Tg-R266K transgene is unable to efficiently rescue neonatal lethality of Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> on a C57BL/6J background. On a C3H/HeJ background, zinc-induced Tg-R266K Cbs<sup>-/-</sup> mice express CBS mRNA, but have very low levels of CBS protein and enzyme activity, resulting in extreme elevations in serum total homocysteine (tHcy). Treatment with pyridoxine did not have any appreciable effect on tHcy, indicating this allele is not pyridoxine responsive in mice. However, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib resulted in an 97% reduction in tHcy and a 2381% increase in liver CBS activity. These studies show that the p.R266K mutation causes increased proteasomal degradation in vivo, and that treatments that stabilize the protein can be used to reverse its effect.

Homocysteine (Hcy) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are important molecules produced during the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. Hcy metabolism is central to the supply of methyl groups that are essential for biological function. Hcy can be either regenerated to methionine or metabolized to cysteine, a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) play a crucial role in metabolizing Hcy to cysteine through the transsulfuration pathway. These two enzymes are also responsible for H2S generation through desulfuration reactions. H2S, at physiological levels serves as a gaseous mediator and has multifaceted effects. Metabolic imbalance of Hcy and H2S has been implicated in pathological conditions including oxidative stress, inflammation, cardiovascular and cerebral dysfunction, fatty liver disease and ischemiareperfusion injury. Organs such as liver, kidney, gut and pancreas contain all the enzymes that are required for Hcy metabolism. The kidney plays an important role in removing Hcy from the circulation. Hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition of elevated blood Hcy level, is a common clinical finding in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI), the latter is often caused by ischemia-reperfusion. This paper reviews exiting literatures regarding (1) the role of kidney in regulating Hcy and H2S metabolism; (2) disruption of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism during ischemiareperfusion; (3) impact of metabolic imbalance of Hcy and H2S on kidney function. Better understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate Hcy and H2S metabolism under physiological and pathophysiological conditions will help improve therapeutic strategies for patients with kidney disease or other organ injuries.

The results of multi-center trials of B vitamin supplementation reveal that, whereas moderately elevated homocysteine predicts increased risk for coronary disease, it does not play a mediating role in this regard. This essay proposes that interleukin-1beta can act on hepatocytes to suppress expression of the hepatocyte-specific forms of methionine adenosyltransferase; this in turn can be expected to decrease hepatic activity of cystathionine-ß-synthase, leading to an increase in plasma homocysteine. It is further proposed that interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß) is a true mediating risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and that elevated homocysteine predicts coronary disease because it can serve as a marker for increased IL-1ß activity. Potent statin therapy may decrease IL-1ß production by suppressing inflammasome activation - thereby accounting for the marked protection from cardiovascular events observed in the classic JUPITER study, in which the enrolled subjects had low-normal Low Density Lipoprotein cholesterol but elevated C-reactive protein.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third gasotransmitter, plays important roles in cancer biological processes. As endogenous H2S exerts pro-cancer functions, inhibition of its production in cancer cells may provide a new cancer treatment strategy and be achieved via regulation of the function of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), one of the main metabolic enzymes synthesizing H2S. This enzyme plays important roles in the development and progression of colon and ovarian cancer, primarily regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics and accelerating cell cycle progression. In the present study, we firstly investigated the role of the CBS/H2S system in human hepatoma cells, and then the inhibitory effect of a quinolone-indolone conjugate QIC2 on this system. When CBS was overexpressed in human hepatoma HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, inhibition of endogenous CBS/H2S significantly reduced their viability and growth rate, as well as the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells. Meanwhile, CBS knockdown caused multiple effects, including apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells, an increase in the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/B cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl-2) ratio, activation of caspase-3 and polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), when compared with the scramble siRNA (Sc siRNA)-transfected groups. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; a microsomal enzyme) expression was significantly decreased while the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was increased in the CBS siRNA-transfected SMMC-7721 cells. QIC2 significantly reduced SMMC-7721 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and showed a lower toxicity in human normal liver HL-7702 cells relative to the positive controls sunitinib and doxorubicin (DOX). The compound also inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. Further analysis indicated that QIC2 downregulated the CBS/H2S system, decreased both HO-1 protein and glutathione (GSH) levels while increased the ROS level and activated the caspase-3 cascade. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the CBS/H2S system plays important roles in human hepatoma cells and QIC2 significantly inhibited cell growth via downregulation of the system.

Homocystinuria due to loss of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) causes accumulation of homocysteine and depletion of cysteine. Current treatments are suboptimal, and thus the development of an enzyme replacement therapy based on PEGylated human truncated CBS (PEG-CBS) has been initiated. Attenuation of potency was observed, which necessitated a screen of several PEG-CBS conjugates for their efficacy to correct and maintain the plasma metabolite profile of murine homocystinuria after repeated administrations interrupted with washouts. We found that CBS coupling with maleimide PEG inconsistently modified the enzyme. In contrast, the PEG-CBS conjugate with 20 kDa N-hydroxysuccinimide-PEG showed very little loss of potency likely due to a reproducible PEGylation resulting in species modified with five PEGs per subunit on average. We developed assays suitable for monitoring the extent of CBS PEGylation and demonstrated a sustainable partial normalization of homocystinuria upon continuous PEG-CBS administration via osmotic pumps. Taken together, we identified the PEG-CBS conjugate suitable for manufacturing and clinical development.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation patterns play a major role in tumorigenesis and the effects of nutrients, especially folate in the diet, on methylation changes is of great importance in colorectal cancer (CRC). Folate deficiency would disrupt methylation patterns; however, its exact effects on DNA methylation patterns in CRC are unclear. This study was performed to gain insight into the methylation changes induced by folate deficiency and the putative role of methylation pattern diversities of related genes in the clinical outcome of CRC.METHODS: The NimbleGen MeDIP chip (Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation chip) assay was used in high-resolution mapping of DNA methylation patterns in the normal human colon mucosal epithelial cell line, NCM460 cultured with or without folate. Aberrant CpG island methylation patterns in the promoter of genes were identified by chip assay and then were confirmed in paired colorectal tissues and corresponding non-malignant tissues obtained from patients by bisulfate sequencing PCR (BSP). Of the total, the expression of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) involved in methyl metabolism and its important substrate, homocysteine, were all detected by realtime RT-PCR and immunostaining. We also analyzed the data of its hypermethylation level statistically correlated with pathological parameters and the clinical outcome in malignant tissues.RESULTS: The chip assay showed that there are 17 genes with hyper or hypomethylation in CpG islands of promoter on chromosome 21, and 8 of them seemed to be associated with tumorigenesis. Among the total, a hypermethylation patterns existed in the promoter of CBS in CRC (p &lt; 0.001), and the hypermethylation is related with the down-regulation of CBS and the accumulation of homocysteine in vitro and vivo (p &lt; 0.001). Univariate analysis showed CBS hypermethylation level is correlated with age (p &lt; 0.001), pT stage (p = 0.008), pN stage (p = 0.038), liver metastasis (p = 0.017), pTNM stage (p = 0.032), Dukes' stage (p = 0.022), recurrence (p = 0.041), five-year survival (p = 0.034), recurrence-free probability (p = 0.011), and overall survival (p = 0.018). Multivariate analysis showed that CBS hypermethylation level significantly correlated with recurrence rate (p = 0.039) and overall survival (p = 0.012) independent of pT stage, pN stage, and liver metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: Folate deficiency could induce aberrant DNA methylation patterns and gene expressions in CRC. CBS plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and could serve as a prognostic marker for tumor progression.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) is implicated in certain retinal neurovascular diseases, although whether it is causative remains uncertain. In isolated ganglion cells (GCs), mild Hhcy induces profound death, whereas retinal phenotypes in Hhcy mice caused by mutations in remethylation (methylene tetrahydrofolatereductase [Mthfr+/-]) or transsulfuration pathways (cystathionine ß-synthase [Cbs+/-]) demonstrate mild GC loss and mild vasculopathy. The current work investigated compensation in vivo of one pathway for the other, and, because the transsulfuration pathway yields cysteine necessary for formation of glutathione (GSH), taurine, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), they were analyzed also.</AbstractText>: Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) is implicated in certain retinal neurovascular diseases, although whether it is causative remains uncertain.

High prevalence of premature coronary heart disease in Pakistanis compared to other populations points towards the genetic predisposition of this population to develop this disease. Since no investigations have been carried out in Pakistan to study the relationship of polymorphisms in genes involved in homocysteine cycle, the objective of the present study was to find out if there is any association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, A1298C; methionine synthase (MS) A2756G; cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) 844ins68, G919A polymorphisms with premature acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a population of Pakistani patients with this disease. In a cross-sectional study, DNA samples of 143 AMI patients (age &lt;45 years) and 153 healthy controls were genotyped for the above mentioned polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP methods. Plasma/serum samples of both patients and healthy controls were screened for homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12. One way ANOVA and chi-squared test were used for analysis of data. Mean plasma homocysteine levels in premature AMI patients and healthy controls were found to be 23±17.2 and 23±13.4 µmol/l, respectively which are higher than the upper normal limit of this biomarker (15µmol/l). MTHFR 677 CT genotype in healthy controls and MTHFR 677 TT genotype in AMI patients were found to have significantly increased levels of plasma homocysteine (p value &lt;0.05), while all other polymorphisms did not show any significant difference in mean levels of homocysteine between AMI patients and healthy controls. Moreover, no association was observed between MTHFR C677T, A1298C; MS A2756C; CBS844ins68 polymorphisms and premature AMI in this population. This indicates that common polymorphisms in MTHFR, MS and CBS genes have no role in premature AMI in Pakistani population.

Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is produced endogenously via two enzymes dependent on pyridoxal phosphate (PLP): cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS, EC 4.2.1.22), cystathionase <U+03B3>-liase (CTH, EC 4.4.1.1), and a third, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST, EC 2.8.1.2). H2S strengthens the defence mechanisms of the gastric mucosal barrier, and plays an important role in gastroprotection, including the increased resistance to damage caused by various irritants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The study was conducted to determine the role of H2S in ulcerated gastric mucosa of rats caused by immobilization in cold water (WRS). The activity and expression of <U+03B3>-cystathionase, cystathionine ß-synthase, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, and rhodanese was compared with healthy mucosa, together with H2S generation, and cysteine, glutathione, and cystathionine levels. The results showed that the defence mechanism against stress is associated with stimulation of the production of H2S in the tissue and confirmed the observed advantageous effect of H2S on healing of gastric ulcers. In case of animals pretreated with exogenous sources of H2S and NaHS, and some changes observed in the ulcerated gastric mucosa tend to return to values found in the healthy tissue, a finding that is in accordance with the previously determined gastroprotective properties of H2S. The results presented in this paper point to the possible role of rhodanese in H2S production in the gastric mucosa of rats, together with the earlier mentioned three enzymes, which are all active in this tissue.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesized via metabolizing L-cysteine by cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) is a potent vasodilator and angiogenic factor. The objectives of this study were to determine if human uterine artery (UA) H2S production increases with augmented expression and/or activity of CBS and/or CSE during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy and whether exogenous H2S dilates UA. Uterine arteries from nonpregnant (NP) premenopausal proliferative (pPRM) and secretory (sPRM) phases of the menstrual cycle and pregnant (P) women were studied. H2S production was measured by the methylene blue assay. CBS and CSE mRNAs were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, and proteins were assessed by immunoblotting and semiquantitative immunofluorescence microscopy. Effects of H2S on rat UA relaxation were determined by wire myography ex vivo. H2S production was greater in NP pPRM and P than NP sPRM UAs and inhibited by the specific CBS but not CSE inhibitor. CBS but not CSE mRNA and protein were greater in NP pPRM and P than NP sPRM UAs. CBS protein was localized to endothelium and smooth muscle and its levels were in a quantitative order of P &gt;NP UAs of pPRM&gt;sPRM. CSE protein was localized in UA endothelium and smooth muscle with no difference among groups. A H2S donor relaxed P &gt; NP UAs but not mesentery artery. Thus, human UA H2S production is augmented with endothelium and smooth muscle CBS upregulation, contributing to UA vasodilation in the estrogen-dominant physiological states in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was identified as the third gasotransmitter in 1996 following the discoveries of the biological importance of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Although H2S has long been considered a highly toxic gas, the discovery of its presence and enzymatic production in mammalian tissues supports a critical role for this physiological signaling molecule. H2S is synthesized endogenously by three enzymes: cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. H2S plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular function as H2S has been shown to modulate: vasodilation, angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Perturbation of endogenous production of H2S has been associated with many pathological conditions of the cardiovascular system such as diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension. As such, modulation of the endogenous H2S signaling pathway or administration of exogenous H2S has been shown to be cytoprotective. This review article will provide a summary of the current body of evidence on the role of H2S signaling in the setting of myocardial ischemia and heart failure. © 2017 American Physiological Society.

METHODS: Anesthetized and instrumented FBM &quot;familial hypercholesterolemia Bretoncelles Meishan&quot; pigs with high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were subjected to polymicrobial septic shock, or sham procedure, and subsequent intensive care therapy for 24 h. Young German domestic pigs were used as naïve controls. CSE, CBS, 3-MST, HO-1, eNOS, and nitrotyrosine expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin sections.RESULTS: FBM pigs, in the absence of septic shock, showed decreased CSE expression in the media. This decrease became more pronounced after sepsis. The expression pattern of HO-1 resembled the pattern of CSE expression. CBS protein was not detected in the media of any of the CA examined but was localized to the adventitia and only in the atheromatous plaques containing foam cells of the CA, in regions that also displayed abundant nitrotyrosine formation. The CBS expression in the adventitia was not associated with nitrotyrosine formation. 3-MST expression was not found in any of the CA samples.CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that (i) the reduced CSE expression in FBM pigs may contribute to their cardiovascular disease phenotype and moreover (ii) the further decrease in CA CSE expression in sepsis may contribute to the sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction.

Classical homocystinuria (HCU) due to inactivating mutation of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a poorly understood life-threatening inborn error of sulfur metabolism. A previously described cbs-/- mouse model exhibits a semi-lethal phenotype due to neonatal liver failure. The transgenic HO mouse model of HCU exhibits only mild liver injury and recapitulates multiple aspects of the disease as it occurs in humans. Disruption of the methionine cycle in HCU has the potential to impact multiple aspect of phospholipid (PL) metabolism by disruption of both the Kennedy pathway and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) mediated synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). Comparative metabolomic analysis of HO mouse liver revealed decreased levels of choline, and choline phosphate indicating disruption of the Kennedy pathway. Alterations in the relative levels of multiple species of PL included significant increases in PL degradation products consistent with enhanced membrane PL turnover. A significant decrease in PC containing 20:4n6 which primarily formed by the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to PC was consistent with decreased flux through PEMT. Hepatic expression of PEMT in both the cbs-/- and HO models is post-translationally repressed with decreased levels of PEMT protein and activity that inversely-correlates with the scale of liver injury. Failure to induce further repression of PEMT in HO mice by increased homocysteine, methionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine or depletion of glutathione combined with examination of multiple homocysteine-independent models of liver injury indicated that repression of PEMT in HCU is a consequence rather than a cause of liver injury. Collectively, our data show significant alteration of a broad range of hepatic PL and choline metabolism in HCU with the potential to contribute to multiple aspects of pathogenesis in this disease.

Altered homocysteine metabolism defined as hyperhomocysteinemia is implicated as pathogenic factor in several cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of prune extract, a good source of phenolic antioxidants, on lowering plasma homocysteine level in male hyperhomocysteinemic mice from average weight of 28 g. The administration of lyophilized prune extract was carried out by intraperitoneal injection one day preceding and one hour before sacrifice of mice. Prune extract decreased significantly plasma homocysteine level, correlated with an increased activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase and NAD(P)H: quinone oxydoreductase-1 activities. Our results suggest a beneficial effect of prune extract on hyperhomocysteinemia with reduction of homocysteine level by its conversion on to SAH by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which is activated by NAD<sup>+</sup>, a by-product of NAD(P)H: quinone oxydo reductase-1.

Extreme hyperhomocysteinemia with low cystathionine and cysteine is virtually diagnostic of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency since remethylation defects and hypermethioninemia due to other inborn errors cause elevated serum cystathionine. However, a pregnant CBS deficient patient was found to have elevated cystathionine in addition to elevated total homocysteine and methionine at 23 weeks of gestation and post-delivery cystathionine decreased to the lower level of normal. A second patient with cystathionine values during gestation also showed a rise from the low pre-pregnant value to massive elevation by delivery. Her infant had severe hyperhomocysteinemia in cord blood with a massive elevation of cystathionine, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine. The infant corrected her homocysteine value by 2 months and is not affected. This data demonstrates that the fetus when exposed to high homocysteine and methionine has increased synthesis of cystathionine which cannot be cleared because the fetus lacks cystathionine gamma-lyase, and thus cystathionine is returned to the mother's circulation. This situation could lead to a misdiagnosis of the cause of hyperhomocysteinemia in a previously undiagnosed pregnant CBS deficient patient. Assays combining homocysteine with cystathionine measurements are commonly available from commercial laboratories in the USA. The recognition of CBS deficiency vs. remethylation disorders is important in order to maximize treatment. The cord blood values revealed a major disturbance in methionine metabolism including a potential for impaired transmethylation reactions in the fetus due to the buildup of S-adenosylhomocysteine. It is possible that monitoring maternal cystathionine during gestation could provide another measure of fetal exposure to homocysteine.

Homocystinuria is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism caused by deficiency of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) activity, biochemically characterized by homocysteine (Hcy) and methionine (Met) accumulation in biological fluids and high urinary excretion of homocystine. Clinical manifestations include thinning and lengthening of long bones, osteoporosis, dislocation of the ocular lens, thromboembolism, and mental retardation. Although the pathophysiology of this disease is poorly known, the present review summarizes the available experimental findings obtained from patients and animal models indicating that oxidative stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of homocystinuria. In this scenario, several studies have shown that enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses are decreased in individuals affected by this disease. Furthermore, markers of lipid, protein, and DNA oxidative damage have been reported to be increased in blood, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle in animal models studied and in homocystinuric patients, probably as a result of increased free radical generation. On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Hcy induces reactive species formation in brain, so that this major accumulating metabolite may underlie the oxidative damage observed in the animal model and human condition. Taken together, it may be presumed that the disruption of redox homeostasis may contribute to the tissue damage found in homocystinuria. Therefore, it is proposed that the use of appropriate antioxidants may represent a novel adjuvant therapy for patients affected by this disease.

High plasma homocysteine (Hcy) <U+200B><U+200B>levels may be responsible for vaso-occlusive episodes and may have acquired and/or genetic causes. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the role of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; C677T; A1298C) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS; T833C/844ins68, G919A) polymorphisms in serum levels of folic acid, vitamin B12 and Hcy, and to verify a possible association between these polymorphisms and the clinical variability. Blood samples of Brazilian patients with a diagnosis of thrombosis were submitted to genotyping by PCR-based methods and serum dosages of folic acid, vitamin B12 and Hcy. Except for the CBS G919A polymorphism, all other genetic markers were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. An increased risk for venous thrombosis was found for the MTHFR 1298CC carriers (OR = 1.688; 95%CI = 0.839-3.398, P = 0.018) and those homozygously mutant for the CBS haplotype 844ins68/T833C (OR = 2.488; 95%CI = 0.501-12.363, P = 0.031), while heterozygous for this CBS haplotype showed an increased risk for higher Hcy levels (OR = 5.900; 95%CI = 1.003-34.691, P = 0.030). Significant interactions were observed among the MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C and CBS haplotype 844ins68/T833C polymorphisms in the results for Hcy levels (P = 0.000), where heterozygous had higher values. Interactions among these polymorphisms can affect serum Hcy levels, where multiple heterozygosis could be a risk factor for vaso-occlusive episodes.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to analyze the relative antioxidant effects of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in mouse liver and brain.RESULTS: Both ASA and SNP show a statistically significant increase of sulfurtransferases activities in liver. The mechanism of action of sodium nitroprusside appears to consist in liberation of nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule in the mammalian body. SNP also releases cyanide ions, which are converted in the liver to thiocyanate by the enzyme rhodanese and/or MPST and/or <U+03B3>-cystathionase - the activities of all the enzymes were elevated in reaction to SNP. The action of <U+03B3>-cystathionase is dependent upon converting cystathionine to cysteine, a precursor of the major cellular antioxidant, glutathione. Under oxidizing conditions, an increase in cystathionine ß-synthase activity might indirectly result in an increase in the antioxidant glutathione level; this was reflected by the increased GSH/GSSG ratio in the liver, but not in the brain, where a trace activity of <U+03B3>-cystathionase is normally detected.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous mediator, synthesized from l-cysteine by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). The mechanism(s) involved in H2S-gastroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) lesions and their time-dependent progression into deeper gastric ulcerations have been little studied. We determined the effect of l-cysteine, H2S-releasing NaHS or slow H2S releasing compound GYY4137 on gastric blood flow (GBF) and gastric lesions induced by 30 min of I followed by 3, 6, 24 and 48 h of R. Role of endogenous prostaglandins (PGs), afferent sensory nerves releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the gastric expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1a and anti-oxidative enzymes were examined. Rats with or without capsaicin deactivation of sensory nerves were pretreated i.g. with vehicle, NaHS (18-180 µmol/kg) GYY4137 (90 µmol/kg) or l-cysteine (0.8-80 µmol/kg) alone or in combination with (1) indomethacin (14 µmol/kg i.p.), SC-560 (14 µmol/kg), celecoxib (26 µmol/kg); (2) capsazepine (13 µmol/kg i.p.); and (3) CGRP (2.5 nmol/kg i.p.). The area of I/R-induced gastric lesions and GBF were measured by planimetry and H2-gas clearance, respectively. Expression of mRNA for CSE, CBS, 3-MST, HIF-1a, glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-2 and sulfide production in gastric mucosa compromised by I/R were determined by real-time PCR and methylene blue method, respectively. NaHS and l-cysteine dose-dependently attenuated I/R-induced lesions while increasing the GBF, similarly to GYY4137 (90 µmol/kg). Capsaicin denervation and capsazepine but not COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors reduced NaHS- and l-cysteine-induced protection and hyperemia. NaHS increased mRNA expression for SOD-2 and GPx-1 but not that for HIF-1a. NaHS which increased gastric mucosal sulfide release, prevented further progression of acute I/R injury into deeper gastric ulcers at 6, 24 and 48 h of R. We conclude that H2S-induced gastroprotection against I/R-injury is due to increase in gastric microcirculation, anti-oxidative properties and afferent sensory nerves activity but independent on endogenous prostaglandins.

This work aimed at studying a possible influence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; c. 677C&gt;T) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS; 844ins68) polymorphisms on overall oxidative status of sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients and on routine markers, correlating them with hydroxycarbamide (HC) treatment. We evaluated 95 unrelated and diagnosed SCA patients. All patients received a prophylactic treatment with folic acid of 5mg/day, while 41 (43.2%) of them were under hydroxycarbamide (HC) treatment (average dose: 22mg/kg/day). MTHFR and CBS polymorphisms were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction. Biochemical parameters were measured using spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods. Routine markers were developed by specialized laboratory. We did not find any effect of 677T and &quot;I&quot; allele combination on the biomarkers evaluated. On the other hand, MTHFR 677T mutation was related to a depletion of antioxidant capacity, according to the decreased catalase activity and a reduction about 30% of glutathione levels. Moreover, the presence of the insertion was related to about 23% less biomolecule oxidation levels and lower monocytes count, but about 14% higher lactate dehydrogenase activity. These findings may contribute to highlight that the MTHFR and CBS polymorphisms involvement in SCA pathophysiology is likely to be far more complex than it was explored to date.

An important mechanism of nutritional &quot;programming&quot; induced by supplementation with methyl donors during pregnancy is the alteration of mRNA abundance in the offspring. We investigated the effects of rumen-protected Met (RPM) on abundance of 17 genes in the 1-carbon, Met, and transsulfuration pathways in calf liver from cows fed the same basal diet without (control, CON) or with RPM at 0.08% of diet dry matter/d (MET) from -21 through +30 d around calving. Biopsies (n = 8 calves per diet) were harvested on d 4, 14, 28, and 50 of age. Cows fed RPM had greater plasma concentration of Met (17.8 vs. 28.2 µM) at -10 d from calving. However, no difference was present in colostrum yield and free AA concentrations. Greater abundance on d 4 and 14 of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2), adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY; also known as SAHH), and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) in MET calves indicated alterations in Met, choline, and homocysteine metabolism. Those data agree with the greater abundance of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) in MET calves. Along with CBS, the greater abundance of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC) and glutathione reductase (GSR) on d 4 in MET calves indicated a short-term postnatal alteration in the use of homocysteine for taurine and glutathione synthesis (both are potent intracellular antioxidants). The striking 7-fold upregulation at d 50 versus 4 of cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), catalyzing the last step of taurine synthesis, in MET and CON calves underscores an important role of taurine during postnatal calf growth. The unique role of taurine in the young calf is further supported by the upregulation of CBS, GCLC, and GSR at d 50 versus 14 and 28 in MET and CON. Although betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) activity did not differ in MET and CON, it increased ~50% at d 14 and 28 versus 4. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.79) was present between BHMT abundance and BHMT activity regardless of treatment. The gradual upregulation over time of BHMT2 and SAHH coupled with the gradual upregulation of MAT1A and the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) in MET and CON calves was indicative of adaptations potentially driven by differences in intake of milk replacer and starter feed as calves grew. In that context, the ~2.5-fold increase in abundance of DNMT3B at d 50 versus 4 in MET and CON indicate that DNA methylation might be an important component of the physiologic adaptations of calf liver. The data indicate that calves from MET-supplemented cows underwent alterations in Met, choline, and homocysteine metabolism partly to synthesize taurine and glutathione, which would be advantageous for controlling metabolic-related stress. Whether the effects in MET calves were directly related to increased Met supply in utero remains to be determined.

The molecular mechanisms leading to and responsible for age-related, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely unknown. It is well documented that aging patients with elevated levels of the amino acid metabolite homocysteine (Hcy) are at high risk of developing AD. We investigated the impact of Hcy on molecular clearance pathways in mammalian cells, including in vitro cultured induced pluripotent stem cell-derived forebrain neurons and in vivo neurons in mouse brains. Exposure to Hcy resulted in up-regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, one of the major kinases in cells that is tightly linked to anabolic and catabolic pathways. Hcy is sensed by a constitutive protein complex composed of leucyl-tRNA-synthetase and folliculin, which regulates mTOR tethering to lysosomal membranes. In hyperhomocysteinemic human cells and cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient mouse brains, we find an acute and chronic inhibition of the molecular clearance of protein products resulting in a buildup of abnormal proteins, including ß-amyloid and phospho-Tau. Formation of these protein aggregates leads to AD-like neurodegeneration. This pathology can be prevented by inhibition of mTORC1 or by induction of autophagy. We conclude that an increase of intracellular Hcy levels predisposes neurons to develop abnormal protein aggregates, which are hallmarks of AD and its associated onset and pathophysiology with age.-Khayati, K., Antikainen, H., Bonder, E. M., Weber, G. F., Kruger, W. D., Jakubowski, H., Dobrowolski, R.

A 30-year-old woman presented with severe headache, dysarthria and right hemiparesis. She was treated for suspected viral encephalopathy and recovered over the following weeks although the headaches persisted. Two months later she was treated in-hospital for pulmonary embolism. The following year she was readmitted for increased frequency of headaches and was given a diagnosis of migraine. A subsequent MRI head scan was suggestive of longstanding venous sinus infarcts and neuroradiology review concluded that encephalitis had been the incorrect initial diagnosis. Subsequent investigations for an underlying cause of the two episodes of venous thrombosis revealed a total homocysteine level of &gt;350 µmol/L (&lt;15 µmol/L). An underlying diagnosis of homocystinuria secondary to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency was made although this metabolic condition is normally recognised in childhood. Treatment with pyridoxine and betaine normalised her homocysteine levels and she has had no further thrombotic event since.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)is a novel gastrotransmitter, and plays a protective role in many diseases. Adipocyte endogenously produces H2S by cystathionine ß synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST).The endogenous H2S in adipocyte plays an essential role in glucose uptake activity and utilization, lipolysis and adipocyte differentiation, and then takes part in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.H2S regulates adipocyte energy metabolism by activation activating insulin receptor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) or potassium channel. H2S acts as an &quot;energy switch&quot; in regulation of metabolic diseases.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are key players in the repair or regeneration of the damaged bone tissue. However, heterogeneity exists between MSCs derived from different donors in their bone formation ability both in vitro and in vivo. The identification of markers defining MSCs with different functional phenotypes is fundamental to maximize their clinical potential. In our previous in vivo study, impaired expression in MSCs of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), the two key enzymes in the catabolic pathway of homocysteine, was associated to decreased bone formation and to the onset of osteoporosis in mice. Here, we investigated whether osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs (hMSCs) modulates the expression of CBS and CSE. The expression of CBS and CSE was also assessed during chondrogenesis to confirm the specificity of their expression during osteogenesis. hMSCs displayed a heterogeneous mineralizing capacity between donors (70% of the samples mineralized, while 30% did not mineralize). Inducible expression of CBS and CSE was found to be associated with a mineralizing phenotype in hMSCs. In particular, up-regulation of CSE was restricted to hMSCs undergoing mineralization. During chondrogenesis, CBS was significantly up-regulated while CSE expression was not affected. Ex-vivo findings confirmed that mature h-osteoblasts (hOBs) show consistently higher expression of CBS and CSE than hMSCs. Our data provide the first evidence that the expression of CBS and CSE in hMSCs closely correlates with the transition of hMSCs toward the osteoblastic phenotype and that CSE may constitute a novel marker of osteogenic differentiation.

We tested the hypothesis that the neuromodulator hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus modulates the febrigenic signaling differently in sedentary and trained rats. Besides H2S production rate and protein expressions of H2S-related synthases cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MPST) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the POA, we also measured deep body temperature (Tb), circulating plasma levels of cytokines and corticosterone in an animal model of systemic inflammation. Rats run on a treadmill before receiving an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 µg/kg) or saline. The magnitude of changes of Tb during the LPS-induced fever was found to be similar between sedentary and trained rats. In sedentary rats, H2S production was not affected by LPS. Conversely, in trained rats LPS caused a sharp increase in H2S production rate that was accompanied by an increased CBS expression profile, whereas 3-MPST and CSE expressions were kept relatively constant. Sedentary rats showed a significant LPS-induced release of cytokines (IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a) which was virtually abolished in the trained animals. Correlation between POA H2S and IL-6 as well as TNF-a was observed. Corticosterone levels were augmented after LPS injection in both groups. We found correlations between H2S and corticosterone, and corticosterone and IL-1ß. These data are consistent with the notion that the responses to systemic inflammation are tightly regulated through adjustments in POA H2S production which may play an anti-inflammatory role downmodulating plasma cytokines levels and upregulating corticosterone release.

Cadmium is an environmental electrophile that modifies reactive thiols in proteins, indicating that this heavy metal may modulate redox-signal transduction pathways. The current consensus is that reactive persulfides and polysulfides produced by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase are highly nucleophilic and thus cadmium may be captured by these reactive sulfur species. It has previously been found that electrophile-mediated covalent modifications of the heat shock protein (HSP) are involved in the activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) pathway. The effects of cadmium on the activation of HSP/HSF1 pathway were investigated in this study. Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells to cadmium resulted in modification of HSP90 and HSF1 activation, thereby up-regulating the downstream protein HSP70. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of HSF1 enhanced the cytotoxicity induced by cadmium, suggesting that the HSP90/HSF1 pathway contributes to protection against cadmium toxicity. The knockdown of CSE and/or cystathionine ß-synthase decreased the levels of reactive sulfur species in the cells and increased the degree of HSP70 induction and cytotoxicity caused by exposure to cadmium. Overexpression of CSE diminished cadmium-mediated up-regulation of HSP70 and cytotoxicity. These results suggest that cadmium activates HSF1 by modifying HSP90 and that reactive sulfur species regulate the redox signal transduction pathway presumably via capture of cadmium, resulting in protection against cadmium toxicity under toxic conditions.

Intra-erythrocytic growth of malaria parasite is known to induce redox stress. In addition to haem degradation which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), the parasite is also thought to efflux redox active homocysteine. To understand the basis underlying accumulation of homocysteine, we have examined the transsulphuration (TS) pathway in the parasite, which is known to convert homocysteine to cysteine in higher eukaryotes. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed absence of key enzymes in the biosynthesis of cysteine namely cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase in the parasite. Using mass spectrometry, we confirmed the absence of cystathionine, which is formed by enzymatic conversion of homocysteine thereby confirming truncation of TS pathway. We also quantitated levels of glutathione and homocysteine in infected erythrocytes and its spent medium. Our results showed increase in levels of these metabolites intracellularly and in culture supernatants. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the long-known occurrence of hyperhomocysteinemia in malaria. Most importantly we find that homocysteine induces the transcription factor implicated in gametocytogenesis namely AP2-G and consequently triggers sexual stage conversion. We confirmed this observation both in vitro using Plasmodium falciparum cultures, and in vivo in the mouse model of malaria. Our study implicates homocysteine as a potential physiological trigger of gametocytogenesis.

Natural products have demonstrated utility in the clinic and can also act as probes to understand complex cellular pathways. Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a mixed polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthase natural product with sub-nano-molar affinity for its receptor cyclophilin A (PPIA). It has been shown to behave in vitro as an immune suppressant. Here, we identify inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) as an intracellular target of the PPIA-SFA binary complex. The formation of this ternary complex does not inhibit the enzymatic activity of IMPDH2. Rather, ternary complex formation modulates cell growth through interaction with the cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domain of IMPDH2. We further demonstrate that the SFA complex is highly isoform selective for IMPDH2 (versus IMPDH1). This work reveals a role for the CBS domains of IMPDH2 in cellular proliferation, suggesting a more complex role than previously suspected for IMPDH2 in T cell activation and proliferation.

Lanthionine is a nonproteinogenic amino acid, composed of two alanine residues that are crosslinked on their ß-carbon atoms by a thioether linkage. It is biosynthesized from the condensation of two cysteine molecules, while the related compound homolanthionine is formed from the condensation of two homocysteine molecules. The reactions can be carried out by either cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) independently, in the alternate reactions of the transsulfuration pathway devoted to hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis. Low plasma total hydrogen sulfide levels, probably due to reduced CSE expression, are present in uremia, while homolanthionine and lanthionine accumulate in blood, the latter several fold. Uremic patients display a derangement of sulfur amino acid metabolism with a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia. Uremia is associated with a high cardiovascular mortality, the causes of which are still not completely explained, but are related to uremic toxicity, due to the accumulation of retention products. Lanthionine inhibits hydrogen sulfide production in hepatoma cells, possibly through CBS inhibition, thus providing some basis for the biochemical mechanism, which may significantly contribute to alterations of metabolism sulfur compounds in these subjects (e.g., high homocysteine and low hydrogen sulfide). We therefore suggest that lanthionine is a novel uremic toxin.

A major reason for vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting is neointimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. Elevated serum levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, but homocysteine levels also tend to increase during the first weeks or months after cardiac surgery. To investigate this further, C57BL/6J mice (WT) and cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygous knockout mice (CBS+/-), a mouse model for hyperhomocysteinaemia, underwent interposition of the vena cava of donor mice into the carotid artery of recipient mice. Two experimental groups were examined: 20 mice of each group underwent bypass surgery (group 1: WT donor and WT recipient; group 2: CBS+/- donor and CBS+/- recipient). After 4 weeks, the veins were harvested, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, stained and analysed by histomorphology and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, serum Hcy levels in CBS knockout animals and in WT animals before and after bypass surgery were measured. At 4 weeks postoperatively, group 2 mice showed a higher percentage of thrombosis compared to controls, a threefold increase in neointima formation, higher general vascularization, a lower percentage of elastic fibres with shortage and fragmentation in the neointima, a lower percentage of acid mucopolysaccharides in the neointima and a more intense fibrosis in the neointima and media. In conclusion, hyperhomocysteinaemic cystathionine-beta-synthase knockout mice can play an important role in the study of mechanisms of vein graft failure. But further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to answer the question whether or not homocysteine itself or a related metabolic factor is the key aetiologic agent for accelerated vein graft disease.

For decades, reactive persulfide species including cysteine persulfide (CysSSH) have been known to exist endogenously in organisms. However, the physiological significance of endogenous persulfides remains poorly understood. That cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase produced CysSSH from cystine was recently demonstrated. An endogenous sulfur transfer system involving CysSSH evidently generates glutathione persulfide (GSSH) that exists at concentrations greater than 100 µM in vivo. Because reactive persulfide species such as CysSSH and GSSH have higher nucleophilicity than parental cysteine (Cys) and glutathione do, these reactive species exhibit strong scavenging activities against oxidants, e.g., hydrogen peroxide, and electrophiles, which contributes to redox signaling regulation. Also, several papers indicated that various proteins and enzymes have Cys polysulfides including CysSSH at their specific Cys residues, which is called protein polysulfidation. Apart from the redox signaling regulatory mechanism, another plausible function of protein polysulfidation is providing protection for protein thiol residues against irreversible chemical modification caused by oxidants and electrophiles. Elucidation of the redox signaling regulatory mechanism of reactive persulfide species including small thiol molecules and thiol-containing proteins should lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies and drug discoveries for oxidative and electrophilic stress-related diseases.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia and no preventive or effective treatment has been established to date. The etiology of AD is poorly understood, but genetic and environmental factors seem to play a role in its onset and progression. In particular, factors affecting the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) are thought to be important and elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, indicating impaired OCM, have been associated with AD. We aimed at evaluating the role of polymorphisms of key OCM enzymes in the etiology of AD, particularly when intakes of relevant B-vitamins are inadequate. Our review indicates that a range of compensatory mechanisms exist to maintain a metabolic balance. However, these become overwhelmed if the activity of more than one enzyme is reduced due to genetic factors or insufficient folate, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and/or vitamin B12 levels. Consequences include increased Hcy levels and reduced capacity to synthetize, methylate and repair DNA, and/or modulated neurotransmission. This seems to favor the development of hallmarks of AD particularly when combined with increased oxidative stress e.g., in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 carriers. However, as these effects can be compensated at least partially by adequate intakes of B-vitamins, achieving optimal B-vitamin status for the general population should be a public health priority.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter, is generated from L-cysteine by mainly 3 enzymes, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-ß-synthase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in cooperation with cysteine aminotransferase. The H2S-forming enzymes, particularly CSE, are overexpressed under the pathological conditions such as inflammation, neuronal or neuroendocrine differentiation and cancer development. Given that Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels mediate some of the biological activity of H2S, we focus on the role of the H2S/Cav3.2 pathway in regulating the neuronal and neuroendocrine function.SUMMARY: In the neuronal system, H2S regulates the activity of various ion channels including Cav3.2. Exogenous and endogenous H2S enhances the Cav3.2 channel activity, promoting somatic and visceral pain signaling. The H2S/Cav3.2 pathway also facilitates neuritogenesis or neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, endogenous H2S formed by CSE regulates secretory function by enhancing Cav3.2 channel activity in neuroendocrine-differentiated prostate cancer cells or carotid glomus cells. Key Messages: The H2S/Cav3.2 pathway may serve as therapeutic targets for treatment of intractable pain, neuronal injury, androgen-independent prostate cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc.

5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly used for the treatment of human cancers; however drug resistance represents a major challenge for its clinical application. In the present study, we reporte that rpL3 induced by 5-FU treatment in Calu-6 cells represses CBS transcription and reduces CBS protein stability leading to a decrease of CBS protein levels. rpL3 also regulates negatively the activation of NF<U+03BA>B by preventing NF<U+03BA>B nuclear translocation through I<U+03BA>B-a up-regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that rpL3 significantly enhances the apoptosis of 5-FU treated Calu-6 cells promoting the overexpression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. We finally demonstrate that rpL3 potentiates 5-FU efficacy inhibiting cell migration and invasion. Our results suggest that combination of rpL3 and 5-FU is a promising strategy for chemotherapy of lung cancers lacking functional p53 that are resistant to 5-FU.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) plays a key role in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. CBS is a multidomain tetrameric enzyme allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Recent crystallographic analyses of engineered CBS lacking the loop made up of residues 516-525 revealed discrepancies in AdoMet binding compared to previous biophysical studies on a full-length CBS. Here, we show that removal of the loop 516-525 functionally eliminates the high affinity sites responsible for kinetic stabilization of the full-length enzyme and yields a dimeric AdoMet-inducible enzyme, in which kinetic stabilization is now exerted by AdoMet binding to the remaining low affinity sites.

Eukaryotic CLC anion channels and transporters are homodimeric proteins composed of multiple a-helical membrane domains and large cytoplasmic C-termini containing two cystathionine-ß-synthase domains (CBS1 and CBS2) that dimerize to form a Bateman domain. The Bateman domains of adjacent CLC subunits interact to form a Bateman domain dimer. The functions of CLC CBS and Bateman domains are poorly understood. We utilized the Caenorhabditis elegans CLC-1/2/Ka/Kb anion channel homolog CLH-3b to characterize the regulatory roles of CLC cytoplasmic domains. CLH-3b activity is reduced by phosphorylation or deletion of a 14-amino-acid activation domain (AD) located on the linker connecting CBS1 and CBS2. We demonstrate here that phosphorylation-dependent reductions in channel activity require an intact Bateman domain dimer and concomitant phosphorylation or deletion of both ADs. Regulation of a CLH-3b AD deletion mutant is reconstituted by intracellular perfusion with recombinant 14-amino-acid AD peptides. The sulfhydryl reactive reagent 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) alters in a phosphorylation-dependent manner the activity of channels containing single cysteine residues that are engineered into the short intracellular loop connecting membrane a-helices H and I (H-I loop), the AD, CBS1, and CBS2. In contrast, MTSET has no effect on channels in which cysteine residues are engineered into intracellular regions that are dispensable for regulation. These studies together with our previous work suggest that binding and unbinding of the AD to the Bateman domain dimer induces conformational changes that are transduced to channel membrane domains via the H-I loop. Our findings provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the roles of CLC Bateman domains and the structure-function relationships that govern the regulation of CLC protein activity by diverse ligands and signaling pathways.

Alcohol is the most socially accepted addictive drug. Alcohol consumption is associated with some health problems such as neurological, cognitive, behavioral deficits, cancer, heart, and liver disease. Mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity are presently not yet clear. One of the mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity has to do with its interaction with amino acid homocysteine (Hcy), which has been linked with brain neurotoxicity. Elevated Hcy impairs with various physiological mechanisms in the body, especially metabolic pathways. Hcy metabolism is predominantly controlled by epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and acetylation. An alteration in these processes leads to epigenetic modification. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the role of Hcy metabolism abnormalities in alcohol-induced toxicity with epigenetic adaptation and their influences on cerebrovascular pathology.

Avian coccidiosis is a widespread and economically significant disease of poultry. It is an enteric disease caused by several protozoan Eimeria species. Eimeria belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa, which exhibits an unusual mechanism of host cell invasion. During invasion of host cells, the protein apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is essential for invasion of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium. Contrary to the roles of AMA1 during host cell invasion in T. gondii and Plasmodium, the precise functions of Eimeria AMA1 (EtAMA1) are unclear. In order to study the functions of EtAMA1, a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library was constructed from E. tenella sporozoites. The EtAMA1 ectodomain was cloned into the pGBKT7 vector to construct the bait plasmid pGBKT7- EtAMA1. Autoactivation and toxicity of the bait protein in yeast cells were tested by comparison with the pGBKT7 empty vector. Expression of the bait protein was detected by western blots. The bait plasmid pGBKT7-EtAMA1 was used to screen yeast two-hybrid cDNA library from E. tenella sporozoites. After multiple screenings with high-screening-rate medium and exclusion of false-positive plasmids, positive preys were sequenced and analyzed using BLAST. We obtained 14 putative EtAMA1-interacting proteins including E. tenella acidic microneme protein2 (EtMIC2), E. tenella putative cystathionine beta-synthase, E. tenella Eimeria-specific protein, four E. tenella conserved hypothetical proteins (one in the serine/threonine protein kinase family) and seven unknown proteins. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that two known proteins were associated with metabolic process, pyridoxal phosphate binding and protein phosphorylation. Functional analysis indicated EtMIC2 was implicated in parasite motility, migration, recognition and invasion of host cells. The data suggested that EtAMA1 may be important during host cell invasion, but also involved in other biological processes.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a rare inherited disorder in the methionine catabolic pathway, in which the impaired synthesis of cystathionine leads to accumulation of homocysteine. Patients can present to many different specialists and diagnosis is often delayed. Severely affected patients usually present in childhood with ectopia lentis, learning difficulties and skeletal abnormalities. These patients generally require treatment with a low-methionine diet and/or betaine. In contrast, mildly affected patients are likely to present as adults with thromboembolism and to respond to treatment with pyridoxine. In this article, we present recommendations for the diagnosis and management of CBS deficiency, based on a systematic review of the literature. Unfortunately, the quality of the evidence is poor, as it often is for rare diseases. We strongly recommend measuring the plasma total homocysteine concentrations in any patient whose clinical features suggest the diagnosis. Our recommendations may help to standardise testing for pyridoxine responsiveness. Current evidence suggests that patients are unlikely to develop complications if the plasma total homocysteine concentration is maintained below 120 µmol/L. Nevertheless, we recommend keeping the concentration below 100 µmol/L because levels fluctuate and the complications associated with high levels are so serious.

Fibrinogen and its functional aspects have been linked to cardiovascular disease. There is vast discrepancy between the heritability of fibrinogen concentrations observed in twin studies and the heritability uncovered by genome wide association studies. We postulate that some of the missing heritability might be explained by the pleiotropic and polygenic co-regulation of fibrinogen through multiple targeted genes, apart from the fibrinogen genes themselves. To this end we investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for phenotypes associated with total and <U+03B3>' fibrinogen concentrations and clot properties. Their individual and accumulative associations with the fibrinogen variables were explored together with possible co-regulatory processes as a result of the gain and loss of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Seventy-eight SNPs spanning the APOB, APOE, CBS, CRP, F13A1, FGA, FGB, FGG, LDL-R, MTHFR, MTR, PCSK-9 and SERPINE-1 genes were included in the final analysis. A novel PCSK-9 SNP (rs369066144) was identified in this population, which associated significantly (p=0.04) with clot lysis time (CLT). Apart from SNPs in the fibrinogen (FGA, FGB and FGG) and FXIII (F13A1) genes, the fibrinogen phenotypes were also associated with SNPs in genes playing a role in lipid homeostasis (LDL-R, PCSK-9) together with CBS and CRP polymorphisms (particularly, CRP-rs3093068). The genetic risk scores, presenting accumulative genetic risk, were significantly associated (p=0.007) with total and <U+03B3>' fibrinogen concentrations, lag time, slope and CLT, highlighting the importance of a polygenetic approach in determining complex phenotypes. SNPs significantly associated with the fibrinogen phenotypes, resulted in a total of 75 TFBS changes, of which 35 resulted in a loss and 40 in a gain of TFBS. In terms of co-regulation, V$IRF4.02, V$E2FF and V$HIFF were of particular importance. The investigation into TFBS provided valuable insight as to how sequence divergences in seemingly unrelated genes can result in transcriptional co-regulation of the fibrinogen phenotypes. The observed associations between the identified SNPs and the fibrinogen phenotypes therefore do not imply direct effects on cardiovascular disease outcomes, but may prove useful in explaining more of the genetic regulation of the investigated fibrinogen phenotypes.

A fast and simple HPLC-based assay has been developed for the simultaneous determination of homocysteine (Hcy) and methionine (Met) in plasma and urine samples, utilizing as small volume of sample as 10µL. The assay uses on-column derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. The separation of Hcy and Met was achieved in 14min on a reversed phase C-18 column, followed by fluorescence detection (excitation at 348nm and emission at 438nm for Met; excitation at 370nm and emission at 480nm for Hcy). Linearity of the detector response was observed in the range of 2-60 µmol L<sup>-1</sup> for Met and 2-40 µmol L<sup>-1</sup> for Hcy. The method was successfully applied for Met and Hcy quantification in human and mouse plasma and urine samples from cystathionine ß-synthase deficient and unaffected individuals.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and low blood levels of folate and cobalamin are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and AD. In elderly subjects with cognitive decline, supplementation with folate, cobalamin, and pyridoxal demonstrated reduction of cerebral atrophy in gray matter regions vulnerable to the AD process. Multiple pathogenic microbes are implicated as pathogenic factors in AD and atherosclerosis, and the deposition of amyloid-ß (Aß), phosphorylation of tau protein, neuronal injury, and apoptosis in AD are secondary to microbial infection. Glucose utilization and blood flow are reduced in AD, and these changes are accompanied by downregulation of glucose transport, Na, K-ATPase, oxidative phosphorylation, and energy consumption. Thioretinaco ozonide, the complex formed from thioretinamide, cobalamin, ozone, and oxygen is proposed to constitute the active site of oxidative phosphorylation, catalyzing synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and phosphate. Pathogenic microbes cause synthesis of polyamines in host cells by increasing the transfer of aminopropyl groups from adenosyl methionine to putrescine, resulting in depletion of intracellular adenosyl methionine concentrations in host cells. Depletion of adenosyl methionine causes dysregulation of methionine metabolism, hyperhomocysteinemia, reduced biosynthesis of thioretinamide and thioretinaco ozonide, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, decreased production of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, and impaired host response to infectious microbes, contributing to the pathogenesis of dementia and atherosclerosis.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been proposed to exert pro- as well as anti-inflammatory effects in various models of critical illness. In this study, we compared bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced changes in inflammatory mediator production, indices of multiple organ injury and survival in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice with reduced expression of one of the three H2S-producing enzymes, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with LPS (10 mg/kg). After 6 h, the animals were sacrificed, blood and organs were collected and the following parameters were evaluated: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in blood, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the lung, cytokine levels in plasma and the expression of the three H2S-producing enzymes (CBS, CSE and 3MST) in the spleen, lung, liver and kidney. LPS induced a tissue-dependent upregulation of some of the H2S-producing enzymes in WT mice (upregulation of CBS in the spleen, upregulation of 3MST in the liver and upregulation of CBS, CSE and 3MST in the lung). Moreover, LPS impaired glomerular function, as evidenced by increased BUN levels. Renal impairment was comparable in the CSE-/- and <U+0394>3MST mice after LPS challenge; however, it was attenuated in the CBS+/- mice. MPO levels (an index of neutrophil infiltration) and MDA levels (an index of oxidative stress) in lung homogenates were significantly increased in response to LPS; these effects were similar in the WT, CBS+/-, CSE-/- and <U+0394>3MST mice; however, the MDA levels tended to be lower in the CBS+/- and CSE-/- mice. LPS induced significant increases in the plasma levels of multiple cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a, interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)<U+03B3>] in plasma; TNFa, IL-10 and IL-12 levels tended to be lower in all three groups of animals expressing lower levels of H2S-producing enzymes. The survival rates after the LPS challenge did not show any significant differences between the four animal groups tested. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that a deficiency in 3MST does not significantly affect endotoxemia, while a deficiency in CBS or CSE slightly ameliorates the outcome of LPS-induced endotoxemia in vivo.

Classic homocystinuria is one of the most common causes of hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia. It is an autosomal recessive and multisystemic disorder due to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency. We described a case of an 18-year-old Portuguese man with an ischaemic stroke, who was subsequently diagnosed with classic homocystinuria [Thr191Met (c.572C&gt;T) CBS mutation] associated with a sensorimotor neuropathy. The patient had a good clinical and metabolic response to pyridoxine plus methionine-restricted diet after 12 months of treatment. Neurophysiological re-evaluation with nerve conduction studies disclosed an improvement on the peripheral nerve lesion. Central nervous system manifestations in classic homocystinuria have been well documented, but this is to the best of our knowledge the first report of an association with peripheral neuropathy, which improved after hyperhomocysteinemia treatment.

Low-level formaldehyde exposure is inevitable in industrialized countries. Although daily-life formaldehyde exposure level is practically impossible to induce cell death, most of mechanistic studies related to formaldehyde toxicity have been performed in cytotoxic concentrations enough to trigger cell death mechanism. Currently, toxicological mechanisms underlying the sub-cytotoxic exposure to formaldehyde are not clearly elucidated in skin cells. In this study, the genome-scale transcriptional analysis in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) was performed to investigate cutaneous biological pathways associated with daily life formaldehyde exposure. We selected the 175 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 116 downregulated DEGs in NHKs treated with 200µM formaldehyde. In the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the 175 upregulated DEGs, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) was identified as the most significant GO biological process in the formaldeyde-treated NHKs. Interestingly, the sub-cytotoxic formaldehyde affected NHKs to upregulate two enzymes important in the cellular transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS). In the temporal expression analysis, the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory DEGs such as MMP1 and PTGS2 was detected earlier than that of CTH, CBS and other ER UPR genes. The metabolites of CTH and CBS, l-cystathionine and l-cysteine, attenuated the formaldehyde-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory DEGs, MMP1, PTGS2, and CXCL8, suggesting that CTH and CBS play a role in the negative feedback regulation of formaldehyde-induced pro-inflammatory responses in NHKs. In this regard, the sub-cytotoxic formaldehyde-induced CBS and CTH may regulate inflammation fate decision to resolution by suppressing the early pro-inflammatory response.

Elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine have been well established as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases, yet the etiologic relationship of homocysteine to these disorders remains poorly understood. Protein N-homocysteinylation has been hypothesized as a contributing factor; however, it has not been examined globally owing to the lack of suitable detection methods. We recently developed a selective chemical method to label N-homocysteinylated proteins with a biotin-aldehyde tag followed by Western blotting analysis, which was further optimized in this study. We then investigated the variation of protein N-homocysteinylation in plasma from rats on a vitamin B12 deficient diet. Elevated &quot;total homocysteine&quot; concentrations were determined in rats with a vitamin B12 deficient diet. Correspondingly, overall levels of plasma protein N-homocysteinylation displayed an increased trend, and furthermore, more pronounced and statistically significant changes (e.g., 1.8-fold, p-value: 0.03) were observed for some individual protein bands. Our results suggest that, as expected, a general metabolic correlation exists between &quot;total homocysteine&quot; and N-homocysteinylation, although other factors are involved in homocysteine/homocysteine thiolactone metabolism, such as the transsulfuration of homocysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase or the hydrolysis of homocysteine thiolactone by paraoxonase 1 (PON1), may play more significant or direct roles in determining the level of N-homocysteinylation.

Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), hydroxyproline, H2S synthesizing activity, and mRNA expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) were determined. Additionally, histopathological examination involved H&amp;E, Sirius red, and caspase-3 immunostaining.Fructose-induced insulin resistance increased serum ALT, TNF-a, H2S and H2S synthesizing activity, and hepatic MDA, hydroxyproline, and CSE mRNA and decreased NO2(-) and GSH. These changes exacerbated the HIR injury in which endogenous H2S production was auxiliary increased. Silymarin preconditioning decreased ALT, AST, MDA, NO2(-), TNF-a, and TNF-a/IL-10 ratio, increased GSH, IL-10, improved hepatic architecture, and lowered caspase-3 immunostaining. Serum H2S, its hepatic synthesizing activity, and CSE and CBS mRNA expressions were all suppressed by silymarin pretreatment.</AbstractText>: Fructose-induced insulin resistance increased serum ALT, TNF-a, H2S and H2S synthesizing activity, and hepatic MDA, hydroxyproline, and CSE mRNA and decreased NO2(-) and GSH.

Staphylococcus aureus is an important opportunistic human pathogen that is highly resistant to osmotic stresses. To survive an increase in osmolarity, bacteria immediately take up potassium ions and small organic compounds known as compatible solutes. The second messenger cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) reduces the ability of bacteria to withstand osmotic stress by binding to and inhibiting several proteins that promote potassium uptake. We identified OpuCA, the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) component of an uptake system for the compatible solute carnitine, as a c-di-AMP target protein in S aureus and found that the LAC*<U+0394>gdpP strain of S aureus, which overproduces c-di-AMP, showed reduced carnitine uptake. The paired cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domains of OpuCA bound to c-di-AMP, and a crystal structure revealed a putative binding pocket for c-di-AMP in the cleft between the two CBS domains. Thus, c-di-AMP inhibits osmoprotection through multiple mechanisms.

The urothelium modulates detrusor activity through releasing factors whose nature has not been clearly defined. Here we have investigated the involvement of H2S as possible mediator released downstream following muscarinic (M) activation, by using human bladder and urothelial T24 cell line. Carbachol stimulation enhances H2S production and in turn cGMP in human urothelium or in T24 cells. This effect is reversed by cysthationine-ß-synthase (CBS) inhibition. The blockade of M1 and M3 receptors reverses the increase in H2S production in human urothelium. In T24 cells, the blockade of M1 receptor significantly reduces carbachol-induced H2S production. In the functional studies, the urothelium removal from human bladder strips leads to an increase in carbachol-induced contraction that is mimicked by CBS inhibition. Instead, the CSE blockade does not significantly affect carbachol-induced contraction. The increase in H2S production and in turn of cGMP is driven by CBS-cGMP/PKG-dependent phosphorylation at Ser(227) following carbachol stimulation. The finding of the presence of this crosstalk between the cGMP/PKG and H2S pathway downstream to the M1/M3 receptor in the human urothelium further implies a key role for H2S in bladder physiopathology. Thus, the modulation of the H2S pathway can represent a feasible therapeutic target to develop drugs for bladder disorders.

A colorimetric coupled enzyme assay for the determination of cystathionine ß-synthase activity is described. The method exploits cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase as an ancillary enzyme capable of transforming cystathionine, produced by cystathionine ß-synthase, into cysteine. The cysteine is then spectrophotometrically detected at 560 nm, after its specific complexation with ninhydrin. This method was used to detect cystathionine ß-synthase in crude extracts, and for the kinetic characterization of the enzyme partially purified from bovine kidney. A rapid two-step protocol is described for the partial purification of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase from bovine kidney, aimed at a suitable and stable ancillary enzyme preparation.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) has been observed to promote hypertension, but the mechanisms are unclear. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is a cellular membrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types of the vasculature. TLR-4 activation has been known to promote inflammation that has been associated with the pathogenesis of hypertension. In this study we hypothesize that HHcy induces hypertension by TLR-4 activation, which promotes inflammatory cytokine (IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a) upregulation and initiation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, leading to cell death and chronic vascular inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we used C57BL/6J (WT) mice, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-deficient (CBS<sup>+/-</sup>) mice with genetic mild HHcy, C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice with TLR-4 mutation, and mice with combined genetic HHcy and TLR-4 mutation (CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H). Ultrasonography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) detected an increase in wall-to-lumen ratio, resistive index (RI), and pulsatility index (PI). Tail cuff blood pressure (BP) measurement revealed elevated BP in CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice. RI, PI, and wall-to-lumen ratio of the SMA in CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H mice were similar to the control group, and BP was significantly alleviated. TLR-4, IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a expression were upregulated in the SMA of CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice and reduced in the SMA of CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H mice. Molecules involved in the mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway (BAX, caspase-9, and caspase-3) were upregulated in CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice and attenuated in CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H mice. We conclude that HHcy promotes TLR-4-driven chronic vascular inflammation and mitochondria-mediated cell death, inducing hypertension. TLR-4 mutation attenuates vascular inflammation and cell death, which suppress hypertension.

Cirrhosis is a end-stage disease of the liver in which fibrogenesis, angiogenesis and distortion of intrahepatic microcirculation lead to increased intrahepatic resistance to portal blood flow, a condition known as portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is maintained by a variety of molecular mechanisms including sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) hyporeactivity, activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), reduction in hepatic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity along with increased eNOS-derived NO generation in the splanchnic and systemic circulations. A reduction of the expression/function of the two major hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), has also been demonstrated. A deficit in the transsulfuration pathway leading to the accumulation of homocysteine might contribute to defective generation of H2S and endothelial hyporeactivity. Bile acids are ligands for nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the G-protein bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1). FXR and GPBAR1 ligands regulate the expression/activity of CSE by both genomic and non-genomic effects and have been proved effective in protecting against endothelial dysfunction observed in rodent models of cirrhosis. GPBAR1, a receptor for secondary bile acids, is selectively expressed by LSECs and its activation increases the expression of CSE and attenuates the production of endotelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor agent. In vivo GPBAR1 ligand attenuates the imbalance between vasodilatory and vaso-constricting agents, making GPBAR1 a promising target in the treatment of portal hypertension.

Sediment contamination can pose risks to the environment, and sediment toxicity tests have been developed to isolate the impact of sediment from other factors. Mixtures of contaminants often occur in sediments, and traditional endpoints used in toxicity testing, such as growth, reproduction, and survival, cannot discern the cause of toxicity from chemical mixtures because of complex interactions. In urban waterways, the synthetic pyrethroid bifenthrin and the metal copper are commonly found in mixtures, so the present study was designed to investigate how these contaminants cause toxicity in mixtures. To investigate this, Chironomus tepperi was exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of copper and bifenthrin-spiked sediments in a 2-way factorial mixture for 5<U+2009>d. Growth and expression profiles of cysteine metabolism genes were measured after exposure. Growth increased at low copper concentrations, decreased at high copper concentrations, and was unaffected by bifenthrin exposures. Copper exposures induced possible cellular repair by upregulating S-adenosylmethionine synthetase expression and downregulating expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and cystathionine-ß-synthase. Metallothionein upregulation was also observed. Bifenthrin exposure altered cysteine metabolism to a lesser extent, downregulating cystathionine-ß-synthase and <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthase. Synergistic, antagonistic, and dose-dependent interactions were observed, and there was evidence of conflicting modes of action and limited substrate production. These findings demonstrate how contextual gene expression changes can be sensitive and specific identifiers of toxicant exposure in mixtures.

Intestinal barrier involves in the pathogeny of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been reported to improve intestinal barrier integrity. Thus, this study investigated the effects of GYY4137, a slow-release H2S donor, on DSS-induced inflammation and intestinal dysfunction. In vitro model, cellular permeability was significantly increased and expression of tight junctions (ZO-1, Cauldin4, and Occludin) was downregulated in Caco-2 cells. GYY4137 treatment markedly attenuated DSS-induced inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-siRNA transfection further demonstrated that endogenous H2S system involves in DSS-induced inflammation and mediates barrier function. In vivo model, DSS exposure caused colonic inflammation and injury in mice and GYY4137 injection alleviated inflammatory response and improved intestinal barrier via reducing intestinal permeability and upregulating of tight junctions. In conclusion, endogenous H2S system involves in DSS-induced inflammation and H2S addition alleviated inflammation and intestinal dysfunction in vitro and in vivo.

PURPOSE: Vascular calcification (VC) is an impact of calcium accumulation in end-stage renal diseases, normally initiated in the mitochondria. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is effective in rescuing mitochondrial function in the neurovascular complications associated with VC, but has limitation in protecting the cardiac mitochondria. However, the STS efficacy in restoring the renal mitochondrial function has not been studied, which is the primary focus of this study.METHODS: Wistar rats (n = 6/group) were administered 0.75 % adenine in the diet for 28 days to induce renal failure. STS (400 mg/kg) was given in two regimens STS_Pre (preventive: along with adenine for 28 days) and STS_Cur (curative: 29th to 49th day). Renal failure was assessed by plasma and urinary markers. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed from oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial physiology and enzymology in the renal tissue.RESULTS: 0.75 % adenine diet caused renal medullary swelling, tubular interstitial nephropathy and impaired renal function (creatinine, urea, uric acid and ALP), which were recovered after STS treatment. The renal failure was due to oxidative stress as measured by elevated malondialdehyde (29 %) and lowered reduced glutathione (27 %) levels. STS reduced the lipid peroxidation and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) elevated the antioxidant enzymes. Further, it improved renal mitochondrial respiratory capacity by maintaining the hyperpolarized membrane potential and restored the complex enzyme activities. Absence of renal DNA fragmentation supports the above findings.CONCLUSION: STS protects the kidney by preserving renal mitochondria, in experimental adenine-induced vascular calcified rats. The efficacy was prominent when given after induction, i.e., in STS_Cur group.

Encephalopathy of prematurity (EOP) is a complex form of cerebral injury that occurs in the setting of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in premature infants. Using a rat model of EOP, we investigated whether neonatal HI of the brain may alter the expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and the components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. We performed unilateral carotid ligation and induced HI (UCL/HI) in Long-Evans rats at P6 and found increased CBS expression in white matter (i.e. corpus callosum, cingulum bundle and external capsule) as early as 24 h (P7) postprocedure. CBS remained elevated through P21, and, to a lesser extent, at P40. The mTOR downstream target 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K and phospho-p70S6K) and 40S ribosomal protein S6 (S6 and phospho-S6) were also overexpressed at the same time points in the UCL/HI rats compared to healthy controls. Overexpression of mTOR components was not observed in rats treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Behavioral assays performed on young rats (postnatal day 35-37) following UCL/HI at P6 indicated impaired preference for social novelty, a behavior relevant to autism spectrum disorder, and hyperactivity. Everolimus restored behavioral patterns to those observed in healthy controls. A gait analysis has shown that motor deficits in the hind paws of UCL/HI rats were also significantly reduced by everolimus. Our results suggest that neonatal HI brain injury may inflict long-term damage by upregulation of CBS and mTOR signaling. We propose this cascade as a possible new molecular target for EOP-a still untreatable cause of autism, hyperactivity and cerebral palsy.

Renal aging is always accompanied by increased oxidative stress. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can be up-regulated by 50% dietary restriction (DR) for 7-day and can block mitochondrial oxidative stress. H2S production exerts a critical role in yeast, worm, and fruit fly models of DR-mediated longevity. In this study, we found that renal aging could be attenuated by 30% DR for 6-month (DR-6M) and life-long (DR-LL), but not for 6-week (DR-6W). The expressions of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) and cystathionine-ß- synthase (CBS) were improved by DR-6M and DR-LL. Endogenous H2S production shared the same trend with CBS and CGL, while glutathione (GSH) didn't. When comparing efficiencies of DR for different durations, more evident production of H2S was found in DR-6M and DR-LL than in DR-6W. Finally the level of oxidative stress was improved by DR-6M and DR-LL rather than by DR-6W. It concluded that aged rats had the ability to produce enough H2S on 30% DR interventions protecting against renal aging, and the effect of DR for long-term were more significant than that of DR for short-term.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive inborn error of metabolism in which patients have extremely elevated plasma total homocysteine and have clinical manifestations in the vascular, visual, skeletal, and nervous systems. Homocysteine is an intermediary metabolite produced from the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is a by-product of methylation reactions involving the methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Here, we have measured SAM, SAH, DNA and histone methylation status in an inducible mouse model of CBS deficiency to test the hypothesis that homocysteine-related phenotypes are caused by inhibition of methylation due to elevated SAH and reduced SAM/SAH ratio. We found that mice lacking CBS have elevated cellular SAH and reduced SAM/SAH ratios in both liver and kidney, but this was not associated with alterations in the level of 5-methylcytosine or various histone modifications. Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation in combination with microarray, we found that of the 241 most differentially methylated promoter probes, 89 % were actually hypermethylated in CBS deficient mice. In addition, we did not find that changes in DNA methylation correlated well with changes in RNA expression in the livers of induced and uninduced CBS mice. Our data indicates that reduction in the SAM/SAH ratio, due to loss of CBS activity, does not result in overall hypomethylation of either DNA or histones.

In lung epithelial cells, hypoxia decreases the expression and activity of sodium-transporting molecules, thereby reducing the rate of transepithelial sodium absorption. The mechanisms underlying the sensing of hypoxia and subsequent coupling to sodium-transporting molecules remain unclear. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been recognized as a cellular signaling molecule whose intracellular concentrations critically depend on oxygen levels. Therefore, it was questioned whether endogenously produced H2S contributes to hypoxic inhibition of sodium transport. In electrophysiological Ussing chamber experiments, hypoxia was established by decreasing oxygen concentrations in the chambers. Hypoxia concentration dependently and reversibly decreased amiloride-sensitive sodium absorption by cultured H441 monolayers and freshly dissected porcine tracheal epithelia due to inhibition of basolateral Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Exogenous application of H2S by the sulfur salt Na2S mimicked the effect of hypoxia and inhibited amiloride-sensitive sodium absorption by both tissues in an oxygen-dependent manner. Hypoxia increased intracellular concentrations of H2S and decreased the concentration of polysulfides. Pretreatment with the cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase inhibitor d/l-propargylglycine (PAG) decreased hypoxic inhibition of sodium transport by H441 monolayers, whereas inhibition of cystathionine-ß-synthase (with aminooxy-acetic acid; AOAA) or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (with aspartate) had no effect. Inhibition of all of these H2S-generating enzymes with a combination of AOAA, PAG, and aspartate decreased the hypoxic inhibition of sodium transport by H441 cells and pig tracheae and decreased H2S production by tracheae. These data suggest that airway epithelial cells endogenously produce H2S during hypoxia, and this contributes to hypoxic inhibition of transepithelial sodium absorption.

This study was performed to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the body burden of heavy metals in Koreans, to provide Korean allele frequencies of selected SNPs, and to assess the difference in allele frequencies with other ethnicities. The candidate-gene approach method and genome-wide association screening were used to select SNPs related to the body burden of heavy metals. Genotyping analysis of the final 192 SNPs selected was performed on 1,483 subjects using the VeraCode Goldengate assay. Allele frequencies differences and genetic differentiations between the Korean population and Chinese (CHB), Japanese (JPT), Caucasian (CEU), and African (YIR) populations were tested by Fisher's exact test and fixation index (F ST), respectively. The Korean population was genetically similar to the CHB and JPT populations (F ST &lt; 0.05, for all SNPs in both populations). However, a significant difference in the allele frequencies between the Korean and CEU and YIR populations were observed in 99 SNPs (60.7%) and 120 SNPs (73.6%), respectively. Ten (6.1%) and 26 (16.0%) SNPs had genetic differentiation (F ST &gt; 0.05) among the Korean-CEU and Korean-YIR comparisons, respectively. The SNP with the largest F ST value between the Korean and African populations was cystathionine-ß-synthase rs234709 (F ST: KOR-YIR, 0.309; KOR-CEU, 0.064). Our study suggests that interethnic differences exist in SNPs associated with heavy metals of Koreans, and it should be considered in future studies that address ethnic differences in heavy-metal concentrations in the body and genetic susceptibility to the body burden of heavy metals.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an emerging neuromodulator that is considered to be a gasotransmitter similar to nitrogen oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). H2S exerts universal cytoprotective effects and acts as a defense mechanism in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. It is produced by the enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03D2>-lyase (CSE), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST), and D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), which are also involved in tissue-specific biochemical pathways for H2S production in the human body. H2S exerts a wide range of pathological and physiological functions in the human body, from endocrine system and cellular longevity to hepatic protection and kidney function. Previous studies have shown that H2S plays important roles in peripheral nerve regeneration and degeneration and has significant value during Schwann cell dedifferentiation and proliferation but it is also associated with axonal degradation and the remyelination of Schwann cells. To date, physiological and toxic levels of H2S in the human body remain unclear and most of the mechanisms of action underlying the effects of H2S have yet to be fully elucidated. The primary purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the role of H2S in the human body and to describe its beneficial effects.

Recent findings revealed in cancer cells novel stress response pathways, which in response to many chemotherapeutic drugs causing nucleolar stress, will function independently from tumor protein p53 (p53) and still lead to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Since it is known that most cancers lack functional p53, it is of great interest to explore these emerging molecular mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that nucleolar stress induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colon cancer cells devoid of p53 leads to the activation of ribosomal protein L3 (rpL3) as proapoptotic factor. rpL3, as ribosome-free form, is a negative regulator of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) expression at transcriptional level through a molecular mechanism involving Sp1. The rpL3-CBS association affects CBS stability and, in addition, can trigger CBS translocation into mitochondria. Consequently apoptosis will be induced through the mitochondrial apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by an increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation. It is noteworthy that silencing of CBS is associated to a strong increase of 5-FU-mediated inhibition of cell migration and proliferation. These data reveal a novel mechanism to accomplish p53-independent apoptosis and suggest a potential therapeutic approach aimed at upregulating rpL3 for treating cancers lacking p53.

Zofenopril, a sulfhydrylated angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), reduces mortality and morbidity in infarcted patients to a greater extent than do other ACEIs. Zofenopril is a unique ACEI that has been shown to increase hydrogen sulfide (H2S) bioavailability and nitric oxide (NO) levels via bradykinin-dependent signaling. Both H2S and NO exert cytoprotective and antioxidant effects.

Cellular turgor is of fundamental importance to bacterial growth and survival. Changes in external osmolarity as a consequence of fluctuating environmental conditions and colonization of diverse environments can significantly impact cytoplasmic water content, resulting in cellular lysis or plasmolysis. To ensure maintenance of appropriate cellular turgor, bacteria import ions and small organic osmolytes, deemed compatible solutes, to equilibrate cytoplasmic osmolarity with the extracellular environment. Here, we show that elevated levels of c-di-AMP, a ubiquitous second messenger among bacteria, result in significant susceptibility to elevated osmotic stress in the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We found that levels of import of the compatible solute carnitine show an inverse correlation with intracellular c-di-AMP content and that c-di-AMP directly binds to the CBS domain of the ATPase subunit of the carnitine importer OpuC. Biochemical and structural studies identify conserved residues required for this interaction and transport activity in bacterial cells. Overall, these studies reveal a role for c-di-AMP mediated regulation of compatible solute import and provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which this essential second messenger impacts bacterial physiology and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

Substrate ambiguity and relaxed reaction specificity underlie the diversity of reactions catalyzed by the transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and <U+03B3>-cystathionase (CSE). These enzymes either commit sulfur metabolism to cysteine synthesis from homocysteine or utilize cysteine and/or homocysteine for synthesis of H2S, a signaling molecule. We demonstrate that a kinetically controlled heme-dependent metabolite switch in CBS regulates these competing reactions where by cystathionine, the product of CBS, inhibits H2S synthesis by the second enzyme, CSE. Under endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions, induction of CSE and up-regulation of the CBS inhibitor, CO, a product of heme oxygenase-1, flip the operating preference of CSE from cystathionine to cysteine, transiently stimulating H2S production. In contrast, genetic deficiency of CBS leads to chronic stimulation of H2S production. This metabolite switch from cystathionine to cysteine and/or homocysteine renders H2S synthesis by CSE responsive to the known modulators of CBS: S-adenosylmethionine, NO, and CO. Used acutely, it regulates H2S synthesis; used chronically, it might contribute to disease pathology.

Since 1972, Drug Metabolism Reviews has been recognized as one of the principal resources for researchers in pharmacological, pharmaceutical and toxicological fields to keep abreast of advances in drug metabolism science in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. With a distinguished list of authors and editors, the journal covers topics ranging from relatively mature fields, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, to a variety of emerging fields. We hope to continue this tradition with the current compendium of mini-reviews that highlight novel biotransformation processes that were published during the past year. Each review begins with a summary of the article followed by our comments on novel aspects of the research and their biological implications. This collection of highlights is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to be illustrative of recent research that provides new insights or approaches that advance the field of drug metabolism.

Sildenafil, a selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, commonly used in the oral treatment for erectile dysfunction, relaxes smooth muscle of human bladder through the activation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) signaling. H2S is an endogenous gaseous transmitter with myorelaxant properties predominantly formed from l-cysteine (l-Cys) by cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). Sildenafil also relaxes rat and human myometrium during preterm labor but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of H2S as a mediator of sildenafil-induced effect in uterine mouse contractility. We firstly demonstrated that both enzymes, CBS and CSE were expressed, and able to convert l-Cys into H2S in mouse uterus. Thereafter, sildenafil significantly increased H2S production in mouse uterus and this effect was abrogated by CBS or CSE inhibition. In parallel, l-Cys, sodium hydrogen sulfide or sildenafil but not d-Cys reduced spontaneous uterus contractility in a functional study. The blockage of CBS and CSE reduced this latter effect even if a major role for CSE than CBS was observed. This data was strongly confirmed by using CSE(-/-) mice. Indeed, the increase in H2S production mediated by l-Cys or by sildenafil was not found in CSE(-/-) mice. Besides, the effect of H2S or sildenafil on spontaneous contractility was reduced in CSE(-/-) mice. A decisive proof for the involvement of H2S signaling in sildenafil effect in mice uterus was given by the measurement of cGMP. Sildenafil increased cGMP level that was significantly reduced by CSE inhibition. In conclusion, l-Cys/CSE/H2S signaling modulates the mouse uterus motility and the sildenafil effect. Therefore the study may open different therapeutical approaches for the management of the uterus abnormal contractility disorders.

BACKGROUND: In classical homocystinuria (HCU, MIM# 236200) due to the deficiency of cystathionine ß-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) there is a clear evidence for the success of early treatment. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a two-tier strategy for HCU newborn screening.METHODS: We reevaluated data from our newborn screening programme for Qatar in a total number of 125,047 neonates including 30 confirmed HCU patients. Our hitherto existing screening strategy includes homocysteine (Hcy) measurements in every child, resulting in a unique dataset for evaluation of two-tier strategies. Reevaluation included methionine (Met) levels, Met to phenylalanine (Phe) ratio, and Hcy. Four HCU cases identified after database closure were also included in the evaluation. In addition, dried blood spot samples selected by Met values &gt;P97 in the newborn screening programs in Austria, Australia, the Netherlands, and Taiwan were analyzed for Hcy.RESULTS: Met to Phe ratio was found to be more effective for first sieve than Met, sorting out nearly 90% of normal samples. Only 10% of the samples would have to be processed by second-tier measurement of Hcy in dried blood spots. As no patient with HCU was found neither in the samples investigated for HCU, nor by clinical diagnosis in the other countries, the generalization of our two-tier strategy could only be tested indirectly.CONCLUSION: The finally derived two-tier algorithm using Met to Phe ratio as first- and Hcy as second-tier requires 10% first-tier positives to be transferred to Hcy measurement, resulting in 100% sensitivity and specificity in HCU newborn screening.

Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity involves in overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. Our previous data demonstrated that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, has a protective effect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator, has potential therapeutic value for oxidative stress-induced neural damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADMA provides protection against the neurotoxicity of glutamate by regulating endogenous H2S generation. In the present study, we found that ADMA prevented glutamate-triggered decrease in endogenous H2S generation in PC12 cells and reversed glutamate-induced suppression in the expression and activity of cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS), the predominant enzymatic source of H2S in PC12 cells. Furthermore, AOAA, a potent inhibitor of CBS, significantly abolished the protective action of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity to PC12 cells. We also showed that ADMA suppressed glutamate-elicited NOS excessive activation and NO overproduction in PC12 cells. These data indicate that the protection of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity is by promoting endogenous H2S generation, resulting from suppression in NOS excessive activation and NO overproduction. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the protection of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.

We investigated the anti-lipogenic effect of betaine in rats fed methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD). Intake of MCD for 3 wk resulted in a significant accumulation of hepatic lipids, which was prevented by betaine supplementation in drinking water (1%). Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was inhibited by MCD intake, and these changes were all inhibited by betaine feeding. Meanwhile, betaine supplementation reversed the reduction of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and the elevation of homocysteine levels in the liver, which could be attributable to the induction of betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Different cell lines were used to clarify the role of homocysteine on activation of the AMPK pathway. Homocysteine treatment decreased pAMPK, pACC, pSREBP-1c and pLKB1 in HepG2 cells. Metformin-induced activation of AMPK was also inhibited by homocysteine. Treatment with hydroxylamine, a cystathionine ß-synthase inhibitor, resulted in a reduction of pAMPK, pACC and pSREBP-1c, accompanied by an elevation of intracellular homocysteine. Betaine treatment prevented the homocysteine-induced reduction of pAMPK, pACC, pSREBP-1c and pLKB1 in H4IIE cells, but not in HepG2 cells. Also the elevation of cellular homocysteine and inhibition of protein expression of BHMT were prevented by betaine only in H4IIE cells which express BHMT. The results suggest that the beneficial effect of betaine against hepatic lipid accumulation may be attributed, at least in part, to the depletion of homocysteine via up-regulation of BHMT in hepatocytes.

In this study, we have identified cystathionine (CTH), a sulfur containing metabolite, to be selectively enriched in human breast cancer (HBC) tissues (~50-100 pmoles/mg protein) compared with undetectable levels in normal breast tissues. The accumulation of CTH, specifically in HBC, was attributed to the overexpression of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), its synthesizing enzyme, and the undetectable levels of its downstream metabolizing enzyme, cystathionine gamma lyase (CGL). Interestingly both CBS and CGL could not be detected in normal breast tissues. We further observed that CTH protected HBC cells against excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. Moreover, CTH promoted both mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis in HBC cells. As both the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum are key organelles regulating the onset of apoptosis, we reasoned that endogenous CTH could be contributing towards increasing the apoptotic threshold in HBC cells. An increased apoptotic threshold is a hallmark of all cancer types, including HBC, and is primarily responsible for drug resistance. Hence this study unravels one of the possible pathways that may contribute towards drug resistance in HBC.

Homocysteine (Hcy) and its metabolites Hcy-thiolactone, N-Hcy-protein, and S-Hcy-protein are implicated in vascular and neurological diseases. However, quantification of these metabolites remains challenging. Here I describe streamlined assays for these metabolites based on their conversion to Hcy-thiolactone. Free Hcy-thiolactone is extracted from the urine with chloroform/methanol. Total Hcy is converted to Hcy-thiolactone in the presence of 1 N HCl. Major urinary protein (MUP)-bound S-linked Hcy is liberated from the protein by reduction with dithiothreitol and converted to Hcy-thiolactone. Acid hydrolysis of MUP with 6 N HCl liberates N-linked Hcy as Hcy-thiolactone, which is then extracted with chloroform/methanol. Ferritin is used as an N-Hcy-protein standard and an authentic Hcy-thiolactone is used to monitor the efficiency of extraction. Hcy-thiolactone (free, derived from total Hcy, or from MUP-bound N-linked or S-linked Hcy) is separated by a cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, post-column derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde, and quantified by fluorescence. Using these assays with as little as 2-20 µL of urine I show that MUP carry N-linked and S-linked Hcy and that N-Hcy-MUP and S-Hcy-MUP and Hcy-thiolactone are severely elevated in cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient mice. These assays will facilitate examination of the role of protein-related Hcy metabolites in health and disease.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate changes in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and redox balance in response to exercise treatment in a tumor-bearing rat model.METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed, or not, to a resistance exercise program 6 wk before inoculation with Walker-256 tumor cells or vehicle. After application, rats maintained their routine for 12 d and were then sacrificed for plasma and liver analyses.RESULTS: Impaired Hcy metabolism was evident after 12 d of tumor cell inoculation as demonstrated by significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration (53%) and decreased plasma cysteine, methionine, and vitamin B12 concentrations. Decreased hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase mRNA levels were found in tumor-bearing rats but not in controls. Tumor inoculation also decreased levels of liver reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased hepatic oxidative stress compared with non-tumor controls. However, resistance exercise prevented the tumor-impaired transsulfuration pathway as demonstrated by the decreased plasma tHcy, hepatic CBS expression, and increased GSH in tumor-exercised versus tumor-sedentary rats. Remarkably, all measures of liver oxidative stress were suppressed by exercise training. Tumor weight was unchanged between groups.CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise prevented tHcy accumulation and liver oxidative damage caused by Walker-256 tumor cell inoculation; the modulatory effects of resistance exercise on Hcy metabolism appear to be at the level of transsulfuration pathway.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gaseous signaling molecule with significant pathophysiological importance, but its role in retinal neovascular diseases is unknown. Hydrogen sulfide is generated from L-cysteine by cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and/or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST).

Arecoline is a major alkaloid of areca nut and has been effect on central nervous system. Although arecoline-induced neurotoxicity has been reported, the possible underlying neurotoxic mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Increasing evidences have shown that both excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and disturbance of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production are involved in the pathophysiology of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Here, the purpose of present study was to verify whether ER stress and the disturbance of endogenous H2S generation are also involved in arecoline-caused neurotoxicity. We found that treatment of PC12 cells with arecoline induced the down-regulation of cells viability and up-regulation of apoptosis and the activity of caspase-3, indicating the neurotoxic role of arecoline to PC12 cells. In addition, arecoline also increased the expression of Bax (pro-apoptotic protein) and attenuated the expression of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) in PC12 cells. Simultaneously, arecoline caused excessive ER stress in PC12 cells, as evidenced by the up-regulations of Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and Cleaved caspase-12 expressions. Notably, the level of H2S in the culture supernatant and the expressions of cystathionine ß-synthase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (two major enzymes for endogenous H2S generation in PC12 cells) were also reduced by arecoline treatment. These results indicate that arecoline-caused neurotoxicity to PC12 cells is involved in ER stress and disturbance of endogenous H2S generation and suggest that the modulation of ER stress and endogenous H2S generation may be potential therapeutic approach in treatment of arecoline-caused neurotoxicity.

Central hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been reported to act as a gaseous neuromodulator involved in the ventilatory and cardiovascular control of normotensive rats, whereas no information is available in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We recorded minute ventilation (VE), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) before and after blocking of enzyme Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) producing H2S in neural tissue by microinjection of aminooxyacetate (inhibitor of CBS) into the fourth ventricle of Wistar normotensive rats (WNR) and SHR followed by 30min of normoxia (21% inspired O2) or hypoxia (10% inspired O2) exposure. Microinjection of AOA or saline (1µL) did not change VE, MAP and HR during normoxia in both WNR and SHR. In WNR, hypoxia caused an increase in VE, HR and a decrease in MAP and these responses were unaltered by AOA. In SHR, hypoxia produced a higher increase of VE, and decrease in MAP and HR when compared to WNR, and these responses were all blunted by AOA. In conclusion, endogenous H2S plays important modulatory roles on hypoxia-induced ventilatory and cardiovascular responses, inhibiting the cardiovascular and stimulating the respiratory systems in SHR.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, defined by an increased plasma homocysteine level, is commonly associated with chronic liver diseases. A link between the elevated homocysteine level and oxidative stress has been demonstrated. Indeed the pathogenesis of liver diseases in the case of hyperhomocysteinemia could be due to this production of oxidative stress. Many studies have demonstrated the antioxidative properties of lycopene, a carotenoid. Therefore, the present study was designed to induce hyperhomocysteinemia in male Wistar rats in order to analyze the effect of lycopene supplementation on homocysteine metabolism, on phase I and phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme activities, and on liver injury by histological examination and analysis of biochemical markers. We found that rats with a high methionine diet showed abnormal histological features, with an increase of serum homocysteine, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, decreased hepatic cystathionine beta synthase and S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase activities and an increased hepatic malondialdehyde level. We demonstrated the reversal effect of lycopene supplementation on hyperhomocysteinemia. Taken together, these findings provide additional clues on the hepatoprotective effects of lycopene.

Alcoholic liver diseases arise from complex phenotypes involving many genetic factors. It is quite common to find hyperhomocysteinemia in chronic alcoholic liver diseases, mainly due to deregulation of hepatic homocysteine metabolism. Dyrk1A, involved in homocysteine metabolism at different crossroads, is decreased in liver of hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Here, we hypothesized that Dyrk1A contributes to alcohol-induced hepatic impairment in mice. Control, hyperhomocysteinemic and mice overexpressing Dyrk1A were fed using a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet with or without ethanol (5% v/v ethanol) for one month, and liver histological examination and liver biochemical function tests were performed. Plasma alanine aminotransferase and homocysteine levels were significantly decreased in mice overexpressing Dyrk1A compared to control mice with or without alcohol administration. On the contrary, the mean plasma alanine aminotransferase and homocysteine levels were significantly higher in hyperhomocysteinemic mice than that of control mice after alcohol administration. Paraoxonase 1 and CYP2E1, two phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, were found increased in the three groups of mice after alcohol administration. However, NQO1, a phase II enzyme, was only found increased in hyperhomocysteinemic mice after alcohol exposure, suggesting a greater effect of alcohol in liver of hyperhomocysteinemic mice. We observed positive correlations between hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity, Dyrk1A and ADH4 protein levels. Importantly, a deleterious effect of alcohol consumption on hepatic Dyrk1A protein level was found. Our study reveals on the one hand a role of Dyrk1A in ethanol metabolism and on the other hand a deleterious effect of alcohol administration on hepatic Dyrk1A level.

Many prokaryotic soluble PPases (pyrophosphatases) contain a pair of regulatory adenine nucleotide-binding CBS (cystathionine ß-synthase) domains that act as 'internal inhibitors' whose effect is modulated by nucleotide binding. Although such regulatory domains are found in important enzymes and transporters, the underlying regulatory mechanism has only begun to come into focus. We reported previously that CBS domains bind nucleotides co-operatively and induce positive kinetic co-operativity (non-Michaelian behaviour) in CBS-PPases (CBS domain-containing PPases). In the present study, we demonstrate that a homodimeric ehPPase (Ethanoligenens harbinense PPase) containing an inherent mutation in an otherwise conserved asparagine residue in a loop near the active site exhibits non-co-operative hydrolysis kinetics. A similar N312S substitution in 'co-operative' dhPPase (Desulfitobacterium hafniense PPase) abolished kinetic co-operativity while causing only minor effects on nucleotide-binding affinity and co-operativity. However, the substitution reversed the effect of diadenosine tetraphosphate, abolishing kinetic co-operativity in wild-type dhPPase, but restoring it in the variant dhPPase. A reverse serine-to-asparagine replacement restored kinetic co-operativity in ehPPase. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the asparagine substitution resulted in a change in the hydrogen-bonding pattern around the asparagine residue and the subunit interface, allowing greater flexibility at the subunit interface without a marked effect on the overall structure. These findings identify this asparagine residue as lying at the 'crossroads' of information paths connecting catalytic and regulatory domains within a subunit and catalytic sites between subunits.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the interaction between H2S and NO (nitric oxide) in the kidney and to evaluate its impact on the functional contribution of a1A and a1B-adrenoreceptors subtypes mediating the renal vasoconstriction in the kidney of rats with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In rats the LVH induction was by isoprenaline administration and caffeine in the drinking water together with intraperitoneal administration of H2S. The responsiveness of a1A and a1B to exogenous noradrenaline, phenylephrine and methoxaminein the absence and presence of 5-methylurapidil (5-MeU) and chloroethylclonidine (CEC) was studied. Cystathione gamma lyase (CSE), cystathione ß synthase (CBS), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphar transferase (3-MST) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were quantified. There was significant up regulation of CSE and eNOS in the LVH-H2S compared to the LVH group (P&lt;0.05). Baseline renal cortical blood perfusion (RCBP) was increased (P&lt;0.05) in the LVH-H2S compared to the LVH group. The responsiveness of a1A-adrenergic receptors to adrenergic agonists was increased (P&lt;0.05) after administration of low dose 5-Methylurapidil in the LVH-H2S group while a1B-adrenergic receptors responsiveness to adrenergic agonists were increased (P&lt;0.05) by both low and high dose chloroethylclonidine in the LVH-H2S group. Treatment of LVH with H2S resulted in up-regulation of CSE/H2S, CBS, and 3-MST and eNOS/NO/cGMP pathways in the kidney. These up regulation of CSE/H2S, CBS, and 3-MST and eNOS/NO/cGMP pathways enhanced the responsiveness of a1A and a1B-adrenoreceptors subtypes to adrenergic agonists in LVH-H2S. These findings indicate an important role for H2S in modulating deranged signalling in the renal vasculature resulting from LVH development.

Homocystinuria, which typically results from cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency, is the most common defect of sulfur amino acid metabolism. CBS condenses homocysteine and serine to cystathionine that is then converted to cysteine. Individuals with homocystinuria have markedly elevated plasma levels of homocysteine and methionine and reduced concentrations of cystathionine and cysteine. Clinical disease manifestations include thromboembolism and neuropsychiatric, ocular, and skeletal complications. Here, we have shown that administration of PEGylated CBS into the circulation of homocystinuria model mice alters the extra- and intracellular equilibrium of sulfur amino acids, resulting in a decrease of approximately 75% in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and normalization of cysteine concentrations. Moreover, the decrease in homocysteine and the normalization of cysteine in PEGylated CBS-treated model mice were accompanied by improvement of histopathological liver symptoms and increased survival. Together, these data suggest that CBS enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a promising approach for the treatment of homocystinuria and that ERT for metabolic diseases may not necessitate introduction of the deficient enzyme into its natural intracellular compartment.

Inherited metabolic disorders are often characterized by the lack of an essential enzyme and are currently treated by dietary restriction and other strategies to replace the substrates or products of the missing enzyme. Patients with homocystinuria lack the enzyme cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), and many of these individuals do not respond to current treatment protocols. In this issue of the JCI, Bublil and colleagues demonstrate that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) provides long-term amelioration of homocystinuria-associated phenotypes in CBS-deficient murine models. A PEGylated form of CBS provided long-term stability and, when used in conjunction with the methylation agent betaine, dramatically increased survival in mice fed a normal diet. The results of this study provide one of the first examples of ERT for a metabolic disorder and suggest that PEGylated CBS should be further explored for use in patients.

Beginning with his identification of the enzyme defect in homocystinuria, he co-discovered cobalamin C disorder as the first known human disorder of vitamin B12 metabolism, thereby extending our concept of homocystinuria as a key feature of related disorders rather than a single disease, and identified new disorders that produce hypermethioninemia. He had no equal in our understanding of how critical methionine metabolism is to human homeostasis.

Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid formed during the metabolism of methionine, is commonly slightly elevated in the plasma of the general population. Additionally, we previously found that cystathionine beta synthase-deficient mice, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia, exhibit altered activities of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME), which dispose of foreign chemicals, in the liver. Thus, hyperhomocysteinemia may result in susceptibility to xenobiotics like cadmium, a heavy-metal toxicant found in drinking water, atmospheric air, and food. Consequently, we exposed hyperhomocysteinemic mice to cadmium via their drinking water for one month to analyze the combined effects of hyperhomocysteinemia and cadmium exposure in liver. No difference in plasma homocysteine level was found after cadmium administration in control and hyperhomocysteinemic mice, but the glutathione level was significantly lower in exposed hyperhomocysteinemic mice compared to control mice, reflecting oxidative stress.

Cadmium exposure negatively affected activity of paraoxonase 1, a calcium-dependent enzyme. Thus, we analyzed another calcium-dependent enzyme known to be dysregulated in liver of hyperhomocysteinemic mice, calpain, which was also significantly lower after cadmium administration. A comparison of the calculated affinities of cadmium docking versus calcium redocking suggested that cadmium ions may inhibit enzymatic activities by preventing the binding of calcium ions. Moreover, the increasedP)H: quinone oxidoreductase activity observed after cadmium administration could indicate the presence of protective mechanisms in liver of mice. In conclusion, although cadmium administration had no effect on plasma homocysteine level, its effects on plasma glutathionine level suggest a susceptibility to cadmium in the condition of hyperhomocysteinemia, which could be countered by an increasedP)H: quinone oxidoreductase activity.

The gaseous neuromodulator H2S is associated with neuronal cell death pursuant to cerebral ischemia. As cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is the primary mediator of H2S biogenesis in the brain, it has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of stroke. Herein, a &quot;zipped&quot; approach by alkene cross-metathesis into CBS inhibitor candidate synthesis is demonstrated. The inhibitors are modeled after the pseudo-C 2-symmetric CBS product (l,l)-cystathionine. The &quot;zipped&quot; concept means only half of the inhibitor needs be constructed; the two halves are then fused by olefin cross-metathesis. Inhibitor design is also mechanism-based, exploiting the favorable kinetics associated with hydrazine-imine interchange as opposed to the usual imine-imine interchange. It is demonstrated that the most potent &quot;zipped&quot; inhibitor 6S reduces H2S production in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing CBS, thereby reducing cell death. Most importantly, CBS inhibitor 6S dramatically reduces infarct volume (1 h post-stroke treatment; ~70% reduction) in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model for ischemia.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third gasotransmitter, is endogenously generated by certain H2S synthesizing enzymes, including cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) from L-cysteine in the mammalian body. Several studies have shown that endogenous and exogenous H2S affects the proliferation of cancer cells, although the effects of H2S appear to vary with cell type, being either promotive or suppressive. In the present study, we determined whether endogenously formed H2S regulates proliferation in human gastric cancer AGS cells. CSE, but not CBS, was expressed in AGS cells. CSE inhibitors, DL-propargylglycine (PPG) and ß-cyano-L-alanine (BCA), significantly suppressed the proliferation of AGS cells in a concentration-dependent manner. CSE inhibitors did not increase lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the same concentration range. The inhibitory effects of PPG and BCA on cell proliferation were reversed by repetitive application of NaHS, a donor of H2S. Interestingly, nuclear condensation and fragmentation were detected in AGS cells treated with PPG or BCA. These results suggest that endogenous H2S produced by CSE may contribute to the proliferation of gastric cancer AGS cells, most probably through anti-apoptotic actions.

Dialysis patients display a high cardiovascular mortality, the causes of which are still not completely explained, but are related to uremic toxicity. Among uremic toxins, homocysteine and cysteine are both substrates of cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase in hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis, leading to the formation of two sulfur metabolites, lanthionine and homolanthionine, considered stable indirect biomarkers of its production. Hydrogen sulfide is involved in the modulation of multiple pathophysiological responses. In uremia, we have demonstrated low plasma total hydrogen sulfide levels, due to reduced cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase expression. Plasma hydrogen sulfide levels were measured in hemodialysis patients and healthy controls with three different techniques in comparison, allowing to discern the different pools of this gas. The protein-bound (the one thought to be the most active) and acid-labile forms are significantly decreased, while homolanthionine, but especially lanthionine, accumulate in the blood of uremic patients. The hemodialysis regimen plays a role in determining sulfur compounds levels, and lanthionine is partially removed by a single dialysis session. Lanthionine inhibits hydrogen sulfide production in cell cultures under conditions comparable to in vivo ones. We therefore propose that lanthionine is a novel uremic toxin. The possible role of high lanthionine as a contributor to the genesis of hyperhomocysteinemia in uremia is discussed.

Nitrogen is an important macronutrient required for plant growth, and is a limiting factor for crop productivity. Improving the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is therefore crucial. At present, the NUE mechanism is unclear and information on the genes associated with NUE in soybeans is lacking. cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) domain-containing proteins (CDCPs) may be implicated in abiotic stress tolerance in plants. We identified and classified a CBS domain-containing protein superfamily in soybean. A candidate gene for NUE, GmCBS21, was identified. GmCBS21 gene characteristics, the temporal expression pattern of the GmCBS21 gene, and the phenotype of GmCBS21 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana under low nitrogen stress were analyzed. The phenotypes suggested that the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings performed better under the nitrogen-deficient condition. GmCBS21-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit higher low nitrogen stress tolerance than WT plants, and this suggests its role in low nitrogen stress tolerance in plants. We conclude that GmCBS21 may serve as an excellent candidate for breeding crops with enhanced NUE and better yield.

Garlic is one natural source of organic sulfur containing compounds and has shown promise in the treatment of chronic liver disease. Dietary garlic consumption is inversely correlated with the progression of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL), although the exact underlying mechanisms are not clear. Our previous studies also have shown that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), the primary organosulfur compound from Allium sativum L, displayed anti-lipid deposition and antioxidant properties in AFL. The aim of the present study was to clarify the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we used the intragastric infusion model of alcohol administration and human normal liver cell line LO2 cultured with suitable ethanol to mimic the pathological condition of AFL. We showed that accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was lowered significantly by the administration of DATS, but antioxidant capacity was increased by DATS. Additionally, DATS inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis via down-regulating Bax expression and up-regulating Bcl-2 expression, and attenuated alcohol-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. More importantly, using iodoacetamide (IAM) to block hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production from DATS, we noted that IAM abolished all the above effects of DATS in ethanol-treated LO2 cells. Lastly, we found DATS could increase the expressions of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), the major H2S-producing enzymes. These results demonstrate that DATS protect against alcohol-induced fatty liver via a H2S-mediated mechanism. Therefore, targeting H2S may play a therapeutic role for AFL.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced in the mammalian body through the enzymatic activities of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). A growing number of studies have revealed that biogenic H2S produced in tissues is involved in a variety of physiological responses in mammals including vasorelaxation and neurotransmission. It is now evident that mammals utilize H2S to regulate multiple signaling systems, echoing the research history of the gaseous signaling molecules nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) that had previously only been recognized for their cytotoxicity. In the human diet, meats (mammals, birds and fishes) and vegetables (plants) containing cysteine and other sulfur compounds are the major dietary sources for endogenous production of H2S. Plants are primary producers in ecosystems on the earth and they synthesize organic sulfur compounds through the activity of sulfur assimilation. Although plant H2S-producing activities have been known for a long time, our knowledge of H2S biology in plant systems has not been updated to the extent of mammalian studies. Here we review recent progress on H2S studies, highlighting plants and bacteria. Scoping the future integration of H2S, NO and O2 biology, we discuss a possible linkage between physiology, ecology and evolutional biology of gas metabolisms that may reflect the historical changes of the Earth's atmospheric composition.

OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to investigate the effects of mucosal acidification on mRNA expression and protein synthesis of cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE), cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), and mucosal release of H2S in gastric mucosa in rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups (8 in each), including: the control group, HCl (10 mM) treated group, HCl (100 mM) treated group, and one group to study the effect of N<U+03C9>-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME). Anesthetized rats underwent tracheostomy and midline laparotomy. Ninety min after the instillation of neutral or acidic solutions, animals were sacrificed and the gastric mucosa was collected to measure the H2S concentration by ELISA method and to quantify mRNA expression of CSE and CBS by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein synthesis was also detected by Western blot method.RESULTS: Mucosal acidification with 10 and 100 HCl, significantly increased mucosal levels of H2S (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001) and mRNA (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001) and protein expressions of CSE (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001). L-NAME treatment reversed H2S release to control level.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that mucosal acidification with HCl increased mucosal release of H2S through upregulation of CSE gene and its protein expression. This effect is mainly mediated through the involvement of nitric oxide.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and its underlying mechanism, to detect H2S and its synthases expression in knee cartilage in patients diagnosed with different severity of OA, and to explore the transcription and expression of gene MMP-13 in chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß or H2S.METHODS: Synovial fluids of the in-patients with different severity of OA hospitalized in Peking University First Hospital were collected for measurement of H2S content using methylene blue assay. Articular cartilages of the patients who underwent knee arthroplasty were collected for the cell culture of relatively normal chondrocytes. The chondrocytes were cultured to the P3 generation and H2S molecular probes were used for detection of endogenous H2S generation in the chondrocytes. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect the localization of H2S synthases including cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST) in OA chondrocytes. Western blot was used to quantify the protein expressions of CSE, MPST, and CBS in cartilage tissues of the patients who were diagnosed with OA and underwent knee arthroplasty. The relatively normal human chondrocytes were cultured to passage 3 and then divided into 4 groups for different treatments: (1)the normal control group, no reagent was added; (2)the IL-1ß group, 5 µg/L of IL-1ß was added; (3)the IL-1ß+H2S group, 200 µmol/L of NaHS was added 30 min before adding 5 µg/L of IL-1ß;(4)the H2S group, 200 µmol/L of NaHS was added. The transcription and expression of gene MMP-13 in chondrocytes of each group were determined with Real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. And the total NF-<U+03BA>B p65 and phosphorylated NF-<U+03BA>B p65 in chondrocytes were detected with Western blot.RESULTS: The content of H2S in the synovial fluid of degenerative knee was (14.3±3.3) µmol/L. Expressions of endogenous H2S and its synthases including CBS, CSE and MPST were present in the cytoplasm of chondrocytes.CSE protein expression in Grade 3 (defined by outerbridge grading) cartilage tissues was significantly increased as compared with that of Grade 1 cartilage tissues (1.67±0.09 vs. 1.26±0.11, P&lt; 0.05). However, no significant difference of CBS or MPST expression among the different groups was observed. The expression of MMP-13 protein in the IL-1ßgroup was significantly higher than that in the normal chondrocytes (1.87±0.67 vs. 0.22±0.10, P&lt;0.05), and that in the IL-1ß+H2S group was significantly decreased than that in the IL-1ß group (0.55±0.11 vs. 1.87±0.67, P&lt; 0.05), and that in the H2S group had no significant difference compared with that in the normal control group. The transcription of MMP-13 protein in the IL-1ß group was significantly higher than that in the normal chondrocytes (31.40±0.31 vs. 1.00±0.00, P&lt;0.05), and that in the IL-1ß+H2S group was significantly decreased than that in the IL-1ß group (24.41±1.28 vs. 31.40±0.31, P&lt;0.05), and that in the H2S group had no significant difference compared with that in the normal control group. The total NF-<U+03BA>B p65 in the IL-1ß group was significantly higher than that in the normal chondrocytes (2.13±0.08 vs. 0.73±0.08, P&lt; 0.05), and that in the IL-1ß+H2S group was significantly decreased than that in the IL-1ß group (1.24±0.13 vs. 2.13±0.08, P&lt;0.05), and that in the H2S group had no significant difference compared with that in the normal control group. The phosphorylated NF-<U+03BA>B p65 in IL-1ß group was significantly higher than that in the normal chondrocytes (1.30±0.13 vs. 0.19±0.04, P&lt;0.05), and that in IL-1ß+H2S group was significantly decreased than that in the IL-1ß group (0.92±0.26 vs. 1.30±0.13, P&lt;0.05), and that in the H2S group had no significant difference compared with that in the normal control group.CONCLUSION: H2S affected the cartilage degeneration by partly inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrix.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. The use of vitamins to modulate homocysteine metabolism substantially lowers the risk by reducing plasma homocysteine levels. In this study, we evaluated the effects of l-serine and related amino acids on homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and endothelial cell damage using EA.hy926 human endothelial cells. Homocysteine treatment decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, which were reversed by cotreatment with l-serine. l-Serine inhibited homocysteine-induced ER stress as verified by decreased glucose-regulated protein 78kDa (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression as well as X-box binding protein 1 (xbp1) mRNA splicing. The effects of l-serine on homocysteine-induced ER stress are not attributed to intracellular homocysteine metabolism, but instead to decreased homocysteine uptake. Glycine exerted effects on homocysteine-induced ER stress, apoptosis, and cell viability that were comparable to those of l-serine. Although glycine did not affect homocysteine uptake or export, coincubation of homocysteine with glycine for 24h reduced the intracellular concentration of homocysteine. Taken together, l-serine and glycine cause homocysteine-induced endothelial cell damage by reducing the level of intracellular homocysteine. l-Serine acts by competitively inhibiting homocysteine uptake in the cells. However, the mechanism(s) by which glycine lowers homocysteine levels are unclear.

Homocystinuria is a disorder of sulfur metabolism pathway caused by deficiency of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). It is characterized by increased accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) in the cells and plasma. Increased homocysteine results in various vascular and neurological complications. Present strategies to lower cellular and plasma homocysteine levels include vitamin B6 intake, dietary methionine restriction, betaine supplementation, folate and vitamin B12 administration. However, these strategies are inefficient for treatment of homocystinuria. In recent years, advances have been made towards developing new strategies to treat homocystinuria. These mainly include functional restoration to mutant CBS, enhanced clearance of Hcy from the body, prevention of N-homocysteinylation-induced toxicity and inhibition of homocysteine-induced oxidative stress. In this review, we have exclusively discussed the recent advances that have been achieved towards the treatment of homocystinuria. The review is an attempt to help clinicians in developing effective therapeutic strategies and designing novel drugs against homocystinuria.

Aims. To examine the expression patterns of hydrogen sulphide- (H2S-) producing enzymes in ischaemic heart tissue and plasma levels of H2S after 2 weeks of NaHS treatment after myocardial infarction (MI) and to clarify the role of endogenous H2S in the MI process. Results. After MI surgery, 2 weeks of treatment with the H2S donor NaHS alleviated ischaemic injury. Meanwhile, in ischemia myocardium, three H2S-producing enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) significantly increased. Plasma H2S levels were also elevated. In vitro, NaHS treatment protected cardiomyocytes from hypoxic injury and raised CBS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Different from in vivo results, however, CSE or 3-MST expression did not change. NaHS treatment increased the activity of CSE/CBS but not of 3-MST. When CSE was either knocked down (in vitro) or knocked out (in vivo), H2S levels significantly decreased, which subsequently exacerbated the ischaemic injury. Meanwhile, the expressions of CBS and 3-MST increased due to compensation. Conclusions. Exogenous H2S treatment changed the expressions of three H2S-producing enzymes and H2S levels after MI, suggesting a new and indirect regulatory mechanism for H2S production and its contribution to cardiac protection. Endogenous H2S plays an important role in protecting ischaemic tissue after MI.

The most common cause of isolated inherited homocysteinemia is a deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Clinical manifestations of CBS deficiency can include ectopia lentis, thromboembolism, marfanoid habits, and intellectual disability. CBS deficiency, which affects the transsulfuration pathway, is marked biochemically by elevated serum homocysteine and plasma methionine. We report a patient with homocysteinemia, low plasma methionine, and no significant neurological abnormalities who presented with bilateral subluxated crystalline lenses due to a 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency. MTHFR deficiency, a disorder in the remethylation pathway, can cause mild to severe disease, although most presentations include neurological involvement. MTHFR deficiency has not been previously associated with lens subluxation or complete dislocation. Prolonged exposure to elevated serum homocysteine levels is most likely the explanation for her ectopia lentis. This case expands the differential diagnosis of homocysteinemia and highlights the need for a correct diagnosis to optimize the clinical outcome of patients with this condition.

Merely considered as a toxic gas in the past, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is currently viewed as the third 'gasotransmitter' in addition to nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), playing a key signalling role in human (patho)physiology. H2S can either act as a substrate or, similarly to CO and NO, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, in the latter case by targeting cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX). The impact of H(2)S on mitochondrial energy metabolism crucially depends on the bioavailability of this gaseous molecule and its interplay with the other two gasotransmitters. The H(2)S-producing human enzyme cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), sustaining cellular bioenergetics in colorectal cancer cells, plays a role in the interplay between gasotransmitters. The enzyme was indeed recently shown to be negatively modulated by physiological concentrations of CO and NO, particularly in the presence of its allosteric activator S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet). These newly discovered regulatory mechanisms are herein reviewed.

Homocysteine is a nonessential, sulfur-containing amino acid involved in one-carbon (folate) metabolism. A number of inherited and acquired conditions cause increased accumulation of this metabolite in blood (homocysteinemia) and other biofluids. Homocysteinemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including recurrent thrombosis. Accurate measurement of total plasma homocysteine is an important element in the diagnostic evaluation of these disorders. While a number of different methods have been developed for this purpose, the focus of this unit will be on a specific technique utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, which provides several advantages in terms of speed, sensitivity, and specificity.

OBJECTIVE: Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently emerged as an important intracellular gaseous signaling molecule within cellular systems. Endogenous H2S is synthesized from l-cysteine via cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and it regulates multiple signaling pathways in mammalian cells. Indeed, aberrant H2S levels have been linked to defects in bone formation in experimental mice. The aim of this study was to examine the potential production mechanism and function of endogenous H2S within primary human periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs).DESIGN: Primary human PDLCs were obtained from donor molars with volunteer permission. Immunofluorescent labeling determined expression of the H2S synthetase enzymes. These enzymes were inhibited with D,L-propargylglycine or hydroxylamine to examine the effects of H2S signaling upon the osteogenic differentiation of PDLCs. Gene and protein expression levels of osteogenic markers in conjunction with ALP staining and activity and alizarin red S staining of calcium deposition were used to assay the progression of osteogenesis under different treatment conditions. Cultures were exposed to Wnt3a treatment to assess downstream signaling mechanisms.RESULTS: In this study, we show that H2S is produced by human PDLCs via the cystathionine ß-synthase/cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase pathway to promote their osteogenic differentiation. These levels must be carefully maintained as excessive or deficient H2S levels temper the observed osteogenic effect by inhibiting Wnt/ß-catenin signaling.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that optimal concentrations of endogenous H2S must be maintained within PDLCs to promote osteogenic differentiation by activating the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling cascade.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was originally considered toxic at elevated levels; however just in the past decade H2S has been proposed to be an important gasotransmitter with various physiological and pathophysiological roles in the body. H2S can be generated endogenously from L-cysteine by multiple enzymes, including cystathionine gamma-lyase, cystathionine beta-synthase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in combination with cysteine aminotransferase. Prostate cancer is a major health concern and no effective treatment for prostate cancers is available. H2S has been shown to inhibit cell survival of androgen-independent, androgen-dependent, and antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cells through different mechanisms. Various H2S-releasing compounds, including sulfide salts, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, sulforaphane, and other polysulfides, also have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer growth and metastasis. The expression of H2S-producing enzyme was reduced in both human prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cells. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is indispensable for the development of castration resistant prostate cancer, and H2S was shown to inhibit AR transactivation and contributes to antiandrogen-resistant status. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of H2S signaling in prostate cancer and described the molecular alterations, which may bring this gasotransmitter into the clinic in the near future for developing novel pharmacological and therapeutic interventions for prostate cancer.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous neurotransmitter that importantly regulates various physiological and pathological events including pain signal transduction. In this study, we investigated the role of spinal NMDA receptors in the nociception induced by intraplantar injection of NaHS, an H2S donor. Intraplantar injection of NaHS into hindpaw significantly decreased the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) in contralateral hindpaw. However, intraplantar formalin injection did not produce PWT in contralateral hindpaw. Intrathecal injection of methemoglobin, a H2S scavenger, abolished hyperalgesia induced by NaHS. In addition, NaHS-induced hyperalgesia was partly, but significantly, attenuated by intrathecal injection of hydroxylamine, a cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) inhibitor. RT-PCR and western blotting analysis revealed that NR2B mRNA and protein levels were increased in the spinal dorsal horn, but not in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in rats subjected to NaHS intraplantar injection. Collectively, these data suggest that peripheral injection of H2S donor causes hyperalgesia through increase in NR2B expression and production of H2S in the spinal cord.

KEY MESSAGE: Differentially expressed antioxidant enzymes, amino acids and proteins in contrasting rice genotypes, and co-location of their genes in the QTLs mapped using bi-parental population, indicated their role in salt tolerance. Soil salinity is a major environmental constraint limiting rice productivity. Salt-tolerant 'CSR27', salt-sensitive 'MI48'and their extreme tolerant and sensitive recombinant inbred line (RIL) progenies were used for the elucidation of salt stress tolerance metabolic pathways. Salt stress-mediated biochemical and molecular changes were analyzed in the two parents along with bulked-tolerant (BT) and bulked-sensitive (BS) extreme RILs. The tolerant parent and BT RILs suffered much lower reduction in the chlorophyll as compared to their sensitive counterparts. Activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) and non-enzymatic antioxidant ascorbic acid were much higher in salt-stressed CSR27 and BT RILs than MI48 and BS RILs. Further, the tolerant lines showed significant enhancement in the levels of amino acids methionine and proline in response to salt stress in comparison to the sensitive lines. Similarly, the tolerant genotypes showed minimal reduction in cysteine content whereas sensitive genotypes showed a sharp reduction. Real time PCR analysis confirmed the induction of methionine biosynthetic pathway (MBP) enzymes cystathionine-ß synthase (CbS), S-adenosyl methionine synthase (SAMS), S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) and serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) genes in tolerant lines, suggesting potential role of the MBP in conferring salt tolerance in rice variety CSR27. Proteome profiling also confirmed higher expression of SOD, POD and plastidic CbS and other proteins in the tolerant lines, whose genes were co-located in the QTL intervals for salt tolerance mapped in the RIL population. The study signifies integrated biochemical-molecular approach for identifying salt tolerance genes for genetic improvement for stress tolerant rice varieties.

AIM: Effective therapy to treat acute pancreatitis (AP) or to prevent its recurrence/complication is still not available. Based on previous results that suggest that: i) hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels were significantly increased in pancreatitis and gastritis and ii) Korean red ginseng (KRG) efficiently attenuated Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis through the suppressive actions of H2S, we hypothesized that KRG can ameliorate experimental pancreatitis through suppression of H2S generation.METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were pre-administered KRG and then subjected to cerulein injection or pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) to induce pancreatitis. Blood and pancreas tissues were collected and processed to measure serum levels of amylase, lipase and myeloperoxidase and the concentration of H2S and the levels of various inflammatory cytokine in pancreatic tissues of mice with induced AP.RESULTS: KRG significantly inhibited NaHS-induced COX-2 and TNF-a mRNA in pancreatic cells, but dl-propargylglycine did not. KRG ameliorated cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis accompanied with significant inactivation of NF-<U+03BA>B and JNK in pancreatic tissues of C57BL/6 mice (p &lt; 0.001) and also significantly ameliorated PDL-induced necrotizing pancreatitis (p&lt;0.01); in both conditions, the significant suppression of H2S resulting from KRG pretreatment afforded rescuing outcomes. Along with suppressed levels of H2S consequent to depressed expressions of CBS and CSE mRNA, KRG administration efficiently decreased the serum level of amylase, lipase, and myeloperoxidase and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in animal models of mild or severe AP.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for the preventive and therapeutic roles of KRG against AP mediated by H2S suppression.

We sought to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins, the key factors of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, in placenta.METHODS: Placental tissues were obtained from pregnant women with preeclampsia and healthy pregnant women who underwent elective cesarean section. Explants and trophoblasts were isolated from healthy placentas and treated with H2S donor and precursor. Western blotting was used to determine the levels of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). The levels of VEGF mRNA, miR miR-200c,-20a and -20b were determined by quantitative real time PCR.RESULTS: NaHS and l-cysteine increased VEGF but not placenta growth factor (PlGF) production in cultured explants and trophoblasts. Transfection of CBS and CSE siRNA reversed the stimulatory effect of l-cysteine on VEGF production in placental cells. H2S prolonged the half-life of VEGF mRNA and decreased the expression of miR-200c,-20a and -20b in placental cells. MiR-200c mimic and inhibitor affected VEGF mRNA and protein level, whereas miR-20a or -20b mimic and inhibitor affect VEGF protein release but not mRNA expression. The expression level of miR-200c,-20a and -20b as well as the level of CBS, CSE and VEGF were downregulated in preeclamptic placentas.CONCLUSION: H2S produced via CSE and CBS plays a critical role in VEGF production in human placenta. Reduced expression of CSE and CBS may contribute to the abnormal production of angiogenic factors in preeclamptic placenta.

Patients with hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), or elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy), are at higher risk of developing arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death; however, the mechanisms are unknown. In this study, the effects of HHcy on sinus node function, atrioventricular conduction, and ventricular vulnerability were investigated by electrophysiological (EP) analysis, and the role of magnesium (Mg(2+)), an endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, in attenuating EP changes due to HHcy was explored. Wild-type mice (WT) and mice receiving Hcy in the drinking water for 12 weeks (DW) were subjected to electrocardiographic and EP studies. DW compared to WT had significantly shorter RR, PR, QT, and HV intervals, corrected sinus node recovery times (CSNRT), Wenckebach periodicity (WP), atrioventricular nodal effective refractory periods (AVNERP), and right ventricular effective refractory periods (RVERP). To examine the role of Mg(2+) in mitigating conduction changes in HHcy, WT, DW, and heterozygous cystathionine-ß-synthase knockout mice (CBS (+/-) ) were subjected to repeat EP studies before and after administration of low-dose magnesium sulfate (20 mg/kg). Mg(2+) had no effect on EP variables in WT, but significantly slowed CSNRT, WP, and AVNERP in DW, as well as WP and AVNERP in CBS (+/-) . These findings suggest that ionic channels modulated by Mg(2+) may contribute to HHcy-induced conduction abnormalities.

BACKGROUND: Suboptimal vitamin B-6 status is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, although the mechanism is unknown. The synthesis of the vasodilator hydrogen sulfide occurs through side reactions of the transsulfuration enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a coenzyme. Two proposed hydrogen sulfide biomarkers, lanthionine and homolanthionine, are produced concurrently.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hydrogen sulfide production is reduced by vitamin B-6 deficiency, we examined the relations between plasma concentrations of lanthionine and homolanthionine, along with other components of the transsulfuration pathway (homocysteine, cystathionine, and Cys), in a secondary analysis of samples from 2 vitamin B-6 restriction studies in healthy men and women.METHODS: Metabolite concentrations were measured in plasma from 23 healthy adults (12 men and 11 women) before and after 28-d controlled dietary vitamin B-6 restriction (0.37 ± 0.04 mg/d). Vitamin B-6 restriction effects on lanthionine and homolanthionine concentrations were assessed. Associations between hydrogen sulfide biomarkers, transsulfuration metabolites, and functional indicators of vitamin B-6 deficiency were analyzed by linear regression.CONCLUSIONS: The resiliency of plasma lanthionine and homolanthionine concentrations after short-term vitamin B-6 restriction suggests a minimal effect of moderate vitamin B-6 deficiency on hydrogen sulfide production. Additional research is needed to better understand the metabolism and disposal of these biomarkers in humans. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00877812.

Studies showed a complex relationship between hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and neuropathic pain. In this study, the relationship between endogenous CBS-H2S pathway in L4-6 spinal cord and neuropathic pain was explored. A total of 163 adult Kunming mice were used in this study. CBS expression and H2S formation in L4-6 spinal cord were detected in the development of neuropathic pain firstly. Then, effect of AOAA, an CBS inhibitor, on treatment of neuropathic pain by chronic construction injury surgery (CCI) was detected. Pain thresholds and activation of NF-<U+03BA>B(p65), ERK1/2 and CREB were measured as biomarks of neuropathic pain. Results showed that CCI surgery significantly upregulated protein expression of CBS and H2S formation. Correlation analysis showed pain thresholds had negative relationships with protein expression of CBS and H2S formation. Treatment with AOAA, a CBS inhibitor, inhibited CCI-induced upregulation of CBS expression and H2S formation (P &lt; 0.05). Further, AOAA significantly decreased activation of NF-<U+03BA>B(p65), ERK1/2 and CREB pathway, and reversed CCI-induced allodynia (P &lt; 0.05). This indicated that CBS-H2S pathway promoted the development of neuropathic pain. CBS-H2S pathway could be a promising target for treatment of neuropathic pain.

OBJECTIVES: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The transsulfuration pathway may be involved in its pathophysiology, since homocysteine, cystathionine and cysteine are increased in PE. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) is a key-enzyme in the pathway, converting homocysteine into cysteine via cystathionine. Another product of CBS is hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a vasodilatory, proangiogenic and cytoprotective gas that is thought to play a role in placental and vascular function during pregnancy. Since single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect CBS expression and/or function, we studied tag-SNPs in the CBS gene in PE patients.STUDY DESIGN: Controls (n=75), early-onset (n=45), and late-onset PE (n=52) cases were genotyped for six tag-SNPs in the CBS gene; rs12329764, rs2851391, rs234713, rs234706, rs1789953, and rs11203172. Plasma homocysteine, cysteine and cystathionine were determined during pregnancy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early-onset PE, late-onset PE.RESULTS: Women with the minor allele of rs11203172 have a reduced risk for early-onset PE. Compared to women without the minor allele, normotensive pregnant women with the minor allele of rs11203172 and rs234713 have lower cysteine levels. Women with the minor allele of rs1789953 have increased levels of cysteine and cystathionine, compared to women without.CONCLUSION: The CBS tag-SNP rs11203172 is associated with a decreased risk for early-onset PE. Decreased cysteine concentrations in normotensive pregnant women carrying the minor allele of rs11203172, may be due to increased cysteine conversion to H2S by CBS. Higher H2S levels may positively affect placentation and vascular function during pregnancy and decrease their risk for PE.

TTHA0829 from Thermus thermophilus HB8 has a molecular mass of 22,754 Da and is composed of 210 amino acid residues. The expression of TTHA0829 is remarkably elevated in the latter half of logarithmic growth phase. TTHA0829 can form either a tetrameric or dimeric structure, and main-chain folding provides an N-terminal cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domain and a C-terminal aspartate-kinase chorismate-mutase tyrA (ACT) domain. Both CBS and ACT are regulatory domains to which a small ligand molecule can bind. The CBS domain is found in proteins from organisms belonging to all kingdoms and is observed frequently as two or four tandem copies. This domain is considered as a small intracellular module with a regulatory function and is typically found adjacent to the active (or functional) site of several enzymes and integral membrane proteins. The ACT domain comprises four ß-strands and two a-helices in a ßaßßaß motif typical of intracellular small molecule binding domains that help control metabolism, solute transport and signal transduction. We discuss the possible role of TTHA0829 based on its structure and expression pattern. The results imply that TTHA0829 acts as a cell-stress sensor or a metabolite acceptor.

Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is the most common loss-of-function inborn error of sulfur amino acids metabolism. HCU is caused by a deficiency in enzymatic degradation of homocysteine, a toxic intermediate of methionine transformation to cysteine, chiefly due to missense mutations in the cystathionine betasynthase (CBS) gene. As with many other inherited disorders, the pathogenic mutations do not target key catalytic residues, but rather introduce structural perturbations leading to an enhanced tendency of the mutant CBS to misfold and either to form non-functional aggregates or to undergo proteasome-dependent degradation. Thus correction of CBS misfolding represents an alternative therapeutic approach for HCU. In this review, we summarize the complex nature of CBS, its multidomain architecture, the interplay between the three cofactors required for CBS function (heme, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine) as well as the intricate allosteric regulatory mechanism only recently explained thanks to advances in CBS crystallography. While roughly half of the patients responds to treatment with a PLP precursor pyridoxine, many studies suggested usefulness of small chemicals, such as chemical and pharmacological chaperones or proteasome inhibitors, rescuing mutant CBS activity in cellular and animal models of HCU. Non-specific chemical chaperones and proteasome inhibitors assist in mutant CBS folding process and/or prevent its rapid degradation, thus resulting in increased steady state levels of the enzyme and CBS activity. Recent increased interest in the field and available structural information will hopefully yield CBS-specific compounds by using high-throughput screening and computational modeling of novel ligands improving folding, stability and activity of CBS.

Dietary methionine restriction (MR) extends life span across species via various intracellular regulatory mechanisms. In rodents, MR induces resistance against adiposity, improves hepatic glucose metabolism, preserves cardiac function, and reduces body size, all of which can affect the onset of age-related diseases. Recent studies have shown that MR-affected biomarkers, such as fibroblast growth factor 21, adiponectin, leptin, cystathionine ß synthase, and insulin-like growth factor 1, can potentially alter physiology. The beneficial effects of MR could be explained in part by its ability to reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress. Studies have revealed that MR can reduce reactive oxygen species that damage cells and promote cancer progression. It has been demonstrated that either MR or the targeting of specific genes in the methionine cycle could induce cell apoptosis while decreasing proliferation in several cancer models. The complete mechanism underlying the actions of MR on the cell cycle during cancer has not been fully elucidated. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as methylation and noncoding RNAs, are also possible downstream effectors of MR; future studies should help to elucidate some of these mechanisms. Despite evidence that changes in dietary methionine can affect epigenetics, it remains unknown whether epigenetics is a mechanism in MR. This review summarizes research on MR and its involvement in metabolism, cancer, and epigenetics.

Hydrogen sulphide (H2 S) is generated endogenously from L-cysteine (L-Cys) by the enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). In addition, L-Cys is commonly used as a precursor in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The aim of the present study is to determine whether L-Cys regulates intestinal nutrient transport. To that end, the presence of CBS and CSE in the jejunum epithelium was assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and the methylene blue assay. In addition, in vivo L-Cys (100 mg/kg, administered immediately after the glucose load) significantly increased blood glucose levels 30 min after the oral administration of glucose to mice. This effect of L-Cys was completely blocked by amino-oxyacetic acid (AOA; 50 mg/kg; administered at the same time as L-Cys) an inhibitor of CBS. Measurements of the short-circuit current (Isc) in the rat jejunum epithelium revealed that L-Cys (1 mmol/L; 6 min before the administration of L-alanine) enhances Na(+)-coupled L-alanine or glucose transport, and that this effect is inhibited by AOA (1 mmol/L;10 min before the administration of L-Cys), but not D,L-propargylglycine (PAG;1 mmol/L; 10 min before the administration of L-Cys), a CSE inhibitor. Notably, L-Cys-evoked enhancement of nutrient transport was alleviated by glibenclamide (Gli;0.1 mmol/L; 10 min before the administration of L-Cys), a K(+) channel blocker. Together, the data indicate that L-Cys enhances jejunal nutrient transport, suggesting a new approach to future treatment of nutrition-related maladies, including a range of serious health consequences linked to undernutrition.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter produced from L-cysteine through the enzymatic action of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and/or cystathionine-ß-synthase. D-Penicillamine is the d isomer of a dimethylated cysteine and has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. AsD-penicillamine is structurally very similar to cysteine, we have investigated whether D-penicillamine, as a cysteine analogue, has an effect on the H2 S pathway.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We tested the effect of D-penicillamine (0.01-1 mM) in mouse aortic rings mounted in isolated organ baths and determined whether it could affect H2 S biosynthesis. In particular, we investigated any possible inhibitor or donor behaviour by using recombinant enzyme-based assays and an in vivo approach.KEY RESULTS: D-Penicillamine, per se, showed little or no vasodilator effect, and it cannot be metabolized as a substrate in place of l-cysteine. However, d-penicillamine significantly reduced L-cysteine-induced vasodilatation in a concentration-dependent manner through inhibition of H2 S biosynthesis, and this effect occurred at concentrations 10 times lower than those needed to induce the release of H2 S. In particular, D-penicillamine selectively inhibited CSE in a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent manner.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that D-penicillamine acts as a selective CSE inhibitor, leading to new perspectives in the design and use of specific pharmacological tools for H2 S research. In addition, the inhibitory effect of D-penicillamine on CSE could account for its beneficial action in rheumatoid arthritis patients, where H2 S has been shown to have a detrimental effect.

The disruption of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) function and the degeneration of photoreceptors are cardinal features of age related macular degeneration (AMD); however there are still gaps in our understanding of underlying biological processes. Excess homocysteine (Hcy) has been reported to be elevated in plasma of patients with AMD. This study aimed to evaluate the direct effect of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) on structure and function of RPE. Initial studies in a mouse model of HHcy, in which cystathionine-ß-synthase (cbs) was deficient, revealed abnormal RPE cell morphology with features similar to that of AMD upon optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA), histological, and electron microscopic examinations. These features include atrophy, vacuolization, hypopigmentation, thickened basal laminar membrane, hyporeflective lucency, choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and disturbed RPE-photoreceptor relationship. Furthermore, intravitreal injection of Hcy per se in normal wild type (WT) mice resulted in diffuse hyper-fluorescence, albumin leakage, and CNV in the area of RPE. In vitro experiments on ARPE-19 showed that Hcy dose-dependently reduced tight junction protein expression, increased FITC dextran leakage, decreased transcellular electrical resistance, and impaired phagocytic activity. Collectively, our results demonstrated unreported effects of excess Hcy levels on RPE structure and function that lead to the development of AMD-like features.

The symbiosis between leguminous plants and soil rhizobia culminates in the formation of nitrogen-fixing organs called nodules that support plant growth. Two Medicago truncatula Tnt1-insertion mutants were identified that produced small nodules, which were unable to fix nitrogen effectively due to ineffective rhizobial colonization. The gene underlying this phenotype was found to encode a protein containing a putative membrane-localized domain of unknown function (DUF21) and a cystathionine-ß-synthase domain. The cbs1 mutants had defective infection threads that were sometimes devoid of rhizobia and formed small nodules with greatly reduced numbers of symbiosomes. We studied the expression of the gene, designated M truncatula Cystathionine-ß-Synthase-like1 (MtCBS1), using a promoter-ß-glucuronidase gene fusion, which revealed expression in infected root hair cells, developing nodules, and in the invasion zone of mature nodules. An MtCBS1-GFP fusion protein localized itself to the infection thread and symbiosomes. Nodulation factor-induced Ca(2+) responses were observed in the cbs1 mutant, indicating that MtCBS1 acts downstream of nodulation factor signaling. MtCBS1 expression occurred exclusively during Medicago-rhizobium symbiosis. Induction of MtCBS1 expression during symbiosis was found to be dependent on Nodule Inception (NIN), a key transcription factor that controls both rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis. Interestingly, the closest homolog of MtCBS1, MtCBS2, was specifically induced in mycorrhizal roots, suggesting common infection mechanisms in nodulation and mycorrhization. Related proteins in Arabidopsis have been implicated in cell wall maturation, suggesting a potential role for CBS1 in the formation of the infection thread wall.

Anemia of end stage renal disease affects 90% of patients on hemodialysis and it is a tremendous concern of patients and health care providers. Renal disease creates a state of renal hypoxia, which may contribute to a lack of erythropoietin production from the kidney when low oxygen levels are sensed. This necessitates the use of exogenous erythropoietin preparations.</AbstractText>: Anemia of end stage renal disease affects 90% of patients on hemodialysis and it is a tremendous concern of patients and health care providers.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine or with cysteine to form cystathionine and either water or hydrogen sulfide, respectively. Human CBS possesses a noncatalytic heme cofactor with cysteine and histidine as ligands, which in its oxidized state is relatively unreactive. Ferric CBS (Fe(III)-CBS) can be reduced by strong chemical and biochemical reductants to Fe(II)-CBS, which can bind carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide (NO()), leading to inactive enzyme. Alternatively, Fe(II)-CBS can be reoxidized by O2to Fe(III)-CBS, forming superoxide radical anion (O2 (<U+0307>¯)). In this study, we describe the kinetics of nitrite (NO2 (-)) reduction by Fe(II)-CBS to form Fe(II)NO()-CBS. The second order rate constant for the reaction of Fe(II)-CBS with nitrite was obtained at low dithionite concentrations. Reoxidation of Fe(II)NO()-CBS by O2showed complex kinetic behavior and led to peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) formation, which was detected using the fluorescent probe, coumarin boronic acid. Thus, in addition to being a potential source of superoxide radical, CBS constitutes a previously unrecognized source of NO()and peroxynitrite.

The Leishmania guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) and inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) are purine metabolic enzymes that function maintaining the cellular adenylate and guanylate nucleotide. Interestingly, both enzymes contain a cystathionine-ß-synthase domain (CBS). To investigate this metabolic regulation, the Leishmania GMPR was cloned and shown to be sufficient to complement the guaC (GMPR), but not the guaB (IMPDH), mutation in Escherichia coli. Kinetic studies confirmed that the Leishmania GMPR catalyzed a strict NADPH-dependent reductive deamination of GMP to produce IMP. Addition of GTP or high levels of GMP induced a marked increase in activity without altering the Km values for the substrates. In contrast, the binding of ATP decreased the GMPR activity and increased the GMP Km value 10-fold. These kinetic changes were correlated with changes in the GMPR quaternary structure, induced by the binding of GMP, GTP, or ATP to the GMPR CBS domain. The capacity of these CBS domains to mediate the catalytic activity of the IMPDH and GMPR provides a regulatory mechanism for balancing the intracellular adenylate and guanylate pools.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter. The levels of H2S-generating enzyme expression and endogenous H2S production in diabetic rats with erectile dysfunction (ED) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the H2S-generating enzymes and endogenous production of H2S in penile tissues of diabetic ED rats.METHODS: Experimental rats were randomly divided into normal control group, apomorphine (APO)-positive group and APO-negative group. Primary rat corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs) and aortic endothelial cells (AECs) were isolated and cultured in vitro under 3 different conditions: normal glucose (NG) condition, high glucose (HG) condition, and osmotic control (OC) condition.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Erectile function; H2S concentrations in plasma or penile tissues; expression of H2S-generating enzymes and endogenous H2S production in penile tissues, CCSMCs, and AECs.RESULTS: Erectile function was significantly decreasedin the APO-negative group. In addition to significantly decreased expression of cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), d-amino acid oxidase (DAO), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), the H2S concentrations in plasma and penile tissues and endogenous H2S production were significantly decreased in the APO-negative group. Endogenous H2S production by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) decreased to the same levels in the APO-negative and APO-positive groups as that in the normal control group. However, CBS and CSE expression remained unchanged in the 3 groups. Under HG conditions, H2S-generating enzyme expression in AECs did not change, while CAT, DAO, and 3-MST expression in CCSMCs was significantly decreased. In both cell types, H2S production by these enzymes was decreased in the HG group.CONCLUSION: Endogenous H2S production was significantly decreased in the diabetic ED rats' penile tissues due to downregulated expression of the CAT/3-MST and DAO/3-MST pathways and low activities of CBS and CSE.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a newly discovered gas transmitter. It is synthesized by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). Endogenous hydrogen sulfide has never been studied in bladder cancer.PURPOSE: We evaluated H2S production and its synthases expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder [UCB]) of human bladder tissue and cell lines.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunostaining was performed in urothelial cell lines and bladder specimens from 94 patients with UCB of different stages/grades. The expression levels/activities of CBS, CSE, and MPST of specimens and cell lines were analyzed by image semiquantity assay, western blot, and a sulfur-sensitive electrode. We tried to find the correlation between hydrogen sulfide and its synthases with tumor stage in UCB. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.RESULTS: Immunoreactivity for CBS, CSE, and MPST was detected in malignant uroepithelium and muscular layer of all tissues examined and cultured cells. The expression levels of CBS, CSE, and MPST were associated with UCB stage/grade. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer samples showed the highest production of H2S (52.6±2.91 nmol/[mg·min]) among all tested samples and EJ cells (transitional cell carcinoma, grade IIIshowed the highest production of H2S among all tested cell lines (53.3±7.02nmol/[mg·min]).CONCLUSIONS: Protein levels and catalytic activities of CBS, CSE, and MPST increased with the increase of malignant degrees in human bladder tissues and human UCB cell lines. Our findings may promote the application of these novel enzymes to UCB diagnosis or treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comparative study of the structural organization of internuclear interneurons involved in the metabolism of nitrogen monoxide, hydrogen sulphide and carbon monoxide in the caudal brain stem humans.METHODS: The cross-sectional study was performed. We used histochemical and immunohistochemical methods to study the internuclear interneurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase, cystathionine ß-synthase and heme oxygenase-2 which are located between the giant and small cell reticular nuclei (cell group 1), small cell reticular nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract (cell group 2) or is surrounded by reticular lateral nucleus (cell group 3).RESULTS: The work was carried out on the corpses of 6 men 18-44 years old who died from causes unrelated to the damage of the central nervous system. We revealed the differences between internuclear organization and intranuclear interneurons and local structural features of internuclear interneurons that are more clearly visible between the cell group 1 including a relatively large number of large neurons and cell groups 2 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001). In the latter two groups small cells with high concentrations of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase-2 dominated.CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that the number of internuclear interneurons significantly is less than the number of intranuclear cells, they have structural prerequisites to control integration processes in the brain. Internuclear interneurons produce gasotransmitters and classical mediators of nerve impulse, form a local chain of interneurons between vasomotor nuclei, share many links with the above and the lower parts of the brain.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of H2 S-induced relaxation in mouse corpus cavernosal tissue. l-cysteine (10(-6) × 10(-3) mol/L) and exogenous H2 S (NaHS; 10(-6) to 10(-3) mol/L) induced concentration-dependent relaxation. l-cysteine-induced relaxations was reduced by d,l-propargylglycine, a cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE) inhibitor but not influenced by aminooxyacetic acid, a cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) inhibitor. l-cysteine induced relaxations, but not of those of H2 S diminished in endothelium-denuded tissues. N(<U+03C9>) -nitro-l-arginine (l-NA; 10(-4) mol/L), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and ODQ (10(-4) mol/L), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, increased the H2 S-induced relaxation. Zaprinast (5 × 10(-6) mol/L) and sildenafil (10(-6) mol/L), phosphodiesterase inhibitors, inhibited H2 S-induced relaxation. Adenylyl cyclase inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide (2.5 × 10(-5) mol/L) and SQ22536 (10(-4) mol/L) reduced relaxation to H2 S. Also, H2 S-induced relaxation was reduced by KCl (50 mmol/L), 4-aminopyridine (10(-3) mol/L), a Kv inhibitor, glibenclamide (10(-5) mol/L), a KATP inhibitor or barium chloride (10(-5) mol/L), a KIR inhibitor. However, H2 S-induced relaxation was not influenced by apamin (10(-6) mol/L), a SKC a (2+) inhibitor, charybdotoxin (10(-7) mol/L), an IKC a (2+) and BKC a (2+) inhibitor or combination of apamin and charybdotoxin. Nifedipine (10(-6) mol/L), an L-type calcium channel blocker and atropine (10(-6) mol/L), a muscarinic receptor blocker, inhibited H2 S-induced relaxation. However, H2 S-induced relaxation was not influenced by ouabain (10(-4) mol/L), a Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase inhibitor. This study suggests that H2 S endogenously synthesizes from l-cysteine by CSE endothelium-dependent in mouse corpus cavernosum tissue, and exogenous H2 S may cause endothelium-independent relaxations via activation of K channels (KATP channel, KV channels, KIR channels), L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway and muscarinic receptor, and there is the interaction between H2 S and NO/cGMP.

Hydrogen sulfide signaling involves persulfide formation at specific protein Cys residues. However, overcoming current methodological challenges in persulfide detection and elucidation of Cys regeneration mechanisms from persulfides are prerequisites for constructing a bona fide signaling model. We here establish a novel, highly specific protein persulfide detection protocol, ProPerDP, with which we quantify 1.52 ± 0.6 and 11.6 ± 6.9 µg/mg protein steady-state protein persulfide concentrations in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and mouse liver, respectively. Upon treatment with polysulfides, HEK293 and A549 cells exhibited increased protein persulfidation. Deletion of the sulfide-producing cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase or cystathionine-ß-synthase enzymes in yeast diminished protein persulfide levels, thereby corroborating their involvement in protein persulfidation processes. We here establish that thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH) systems can independently catalyze reductions of inorganic polysulfides and protein persulfides. Increased endogenous persulfide levels and protein persulfidation following polysulfide treatment in thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) or thioredoxin-related protein of 14 kDa (TRP14) knockdown HEK293 cells indicated that these enzymes constitute a potent regeneration system of Cys residues from persulfides in a cellular context. Furthermore, TrxR1-deficient cells were less viable upon treatment with toxic amounts of polysulfides compared to control cells. Emphasizing the dominant role of cytosolic disulfide reduction systems in maintaining sulfane sulfur homeostasis in vivo, protein persulfide levels were markedly elevated in mouse livers where hepatocytes lack both TrxR1 and glutathione reductase (TR/GR-null). The different persulfide patterns observed in wild-type, GR-null, and TR/GR-null livers suggest distinct roles for the Trx and GSH systems in regulating subsets of protein persulfides and thereby fine-tuning sulfide signaling pathways.

Many pathogenic missense mutations in human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) cause misfolding of the mutant enzyme resulting in aggregation or rapid degradation of the protein. Subsequent loss of CBS function leads to CBS-deficient homocystinuria (CBSDH). CBS contains two sets of binding sites for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) that independently regulate the enzyme activity and kinetically stabilize its regulatory domain. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that CBS activation may be decoupled from kinetic stabilization and thus CBS regulatory domain can serve as a novel drug target for CBSDH. We determined the effect of SAM and its close structural analogs on CBS activity, their binding to and stabilization of the regulatory domain in the absence and presence of competing SAM. Binding of S-adenosylhomocysteine and sinefungin lead to stabilization of the regulatory domains without activation of CBS. Direct titrations and competition experiments support specific binding of these two SAM analogs to the stabilizing sites. Binding of these two ligands also affects the enzyme proteolysis rate supporting the role of the stabilizing sites in CBS dynamics. Our results indicate that binding of SAM to regulatory and stabilizing sites in CBS may have evolved to display an exquisite thermodynamic and structural specificity towards SAM as well as the ability to transduce the allosteric signal responsible for CBS activation. Thus, ligands may be developed to function as kinetic stabilizers or pharmacological chaperones without interfering with the physiological activation of CBS by SAM.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signalling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. There is increasing evidence that H2S is implicated in aging and lifespan control in the diet-induced longevity models. However, blood sulfide concentration of naturally long-lived species is not known. Here we measured blood sulfide in the long-lived naked mole-rat and five other mammalian species considerably differing in lifespan and found a negative correlation between blood sulfide and maximum longevity residual. In addition, we show that the naked mole-rat cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), an enzyme whose activity in the liver significantly contributes to systemic sulfide levels, has lower activity in the liver and is activated to a higher degree by S-adenosylmethionine compared to other species. These results add complexity to the understanding of the role of H2S in aging and call for detailed research on naked mole-rat transsulfuration.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) functions in many physiological processes, including relaxation of vascular smooth muscles, mediation of neurotransmission, inhibition of insulin signaling, and regulation of inflammation. On the other hand, sulfane sulfur, which is a sulfur atom with six valence electrons but no charge, has the unique ability to bind reversibly to other sulfur atoms to form hydropersulfides (R-S-SH) and polysulfides (-S-Sn-S-). H2S and sulfane sulfur always coexist, and recent work suggests that sulfane sulfur species may be the actual signaling molecules in at least some biological phenomena. For example, one of the mechanisms of activity regulation of proteins by H2S is the S-sulfhydration of cysteine residues (protein Cys-SSH). In this review, we summarize recent progress on chemical tools for the study of H2S and sulfane sulfur, covering fluorescence probes utilizing various design strategies, H2S caged compounds, inhibitors of physiological H2S-producing enzymes (cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine ß-synthase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase), and labeling reagents. Fluorescence probes offer particular advantages as chemical tools to study physiological functions of biomolecules, including ease of use and real-time, nondestructive visualization of biological processes in live cells and tissues.

Two enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine -cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and gamma-cystathionase (CTH)-use cysteine and/or homocysteine to produce the important signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and simultaneously the thioethers lanthionine, cystathionine or homolanthionine. In this study we explored whether impaired flux of substrates for H2S synthesis and/or deficient enzyme activities alter production of hydrogen sulfide in patients with homocystinurias. As an indirect measure of H2S synthesis we determined by LC-MS/MS concentrations of thioethers in plasma samples from 33 patients with different types of homocystinurias, in 8 patient derived fibroblast cell lines, and as reaction products of seven purified mutant CBS enzymes. Since chaperoned recombinant mutant CBS enzymes retained capacity of H2S synthesis in vitro it can be stipulated that deficient CBS activity in vivo may impair H2S production. Indeed, in patients with classical homocystinuria we observed significantly decreased cystathionine and lanthionine concentrations in plasma (46% and 74% of median control levels, respectively) and significantly lower cystathionine in fibroblasts (8% of median control concentrations) indicating that H2S production from cysteine and homocysteine may be also impaired. In contrast, the grossly elevated plasma levels of homolanthionine in CBS deficient patients (32-times elevation compared to median of controls) clearly demonstrates a simultaneous overproduction of H2S from homocysteine by CTH. In the remethylation defects the accumulation of homocysteine and the increased flux of metabolites through the transsulfuration pathway resulted in elevation of cystathionine and homolanthionine (857% and 400% of median control values, respectively) indicating a possibility of an increased biosynthesis of H2S by both CBS and CTH. This study shows clearly disturbed thioether concentrations in homocystinurias, and modeling using these data indicates that H2S synthesis may be increased in these conditions. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to explore the possible implications for pathophysiology of these disorders.

The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) the impact of tumor growth on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism, liver oxidative stress and cancer cachexia and, (2) the potential benefits of creatine supplementation in Walker-256 tumor-bearing rats. Three experiments were conducted. First, rats were killed on days 5 (D5), 10 (D10) and 14 (D14) after tumor implantation. In experiment 2, rats were randomly assigned to three groups designated as control (C), tumor-bearing (T) and tumor-bearing supplemented with creatine (TCr). A life span experiment was conducted as the third experiment. Creatine was supplied in drinking water for 21 days (8 g/L) in all cases. Tumor implantation consisted of a suspension of Walker-256 cells (8.0 × 10(7) cells in 0.5 mL of PBS). The progressive increase (P &lt; 0.05) in tumor mass coincided with a progressively lower body weight and higher hepatic oxidative stress; plasma Hcy concentration was 80 % higher (P &lt; 0.05) by 10 days of tumor implantation. Impaired Hcy metabolism was evidenced by decreased hepatic betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (Bhmt), glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt) and cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene expression. In contrast, creatine supplementation promoted a 28 % reduction of tumor weight (P &lt; 0.05). Plasma Hcy (C 6.1 ± 0.6, T 10.3 ± 1.5, TCr 6.3 ± 0.9, µmol/L) and hepatic oxidative stress were lower in the TCr group compared to T. Creatine supplementation was unable to decrease Hcy concentration and to increase SAM/SAH ratio in tumor tissue. These data suggest that creatine effects on hepatic impaired Hcy metabolism promoted by tumor cell inoculation are responsible to decrease plasma Hcy in tumor-bearing rats. In conclusion, Walker-256 tumor growth is associated with progressive hyperhomocysteinemia, body weight loss and liver oxidative stress in rats. Creatine supplementation, however, prevented these tumor-associated perturbations.

The transsulfuration pathway (TS) acts in sulfur amino acid metabolism by contributing to the regulation of cellular homocysteine, cysteine production, and the generation of H2S for signaling functions. Regulation of TS pathway kinetics involves stimulation of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and oxidants such as H2O2, and by Michaelis-Menten principles whereby substrate concentrations affect reaction rates. Although pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) serves as coenzyme for both CBS and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), CSE exhibits much greater loss of activity than CBS during PLP insufficiency. Thus, cellular and plasma cystathionine concentrations increase in vitamin B6 deficiency mainly due to the bottleneck caused by reduced CSE activity. Because of the increase in cystathionine, the canonical production of cysteine (homocysteine <U+2192> cystathionine <U+2192> cysteine) is largely maintained even during vitamin B6 deficiency. Typical whole body transsulfuration flux in humans is 3-7 µmol/h per kg body weight. The in vivo kinetics of H2S production via side reactions of CBS and CSE in humans are unknown but they have been reported for cultured HepG2 cells. In these studies, cells exhibit a pronounced reduction in H2S production capacity and rates of lanthionine and homolanthionine synthesis in deficiency. In humans, plasma concentrations of lanthionine and homolanthionine exhibit little or no mean change due to 4-wk vitamin B6 restriction, nor do they respond to pyridoxine supplementation of subjects in chronically low-vitamin B6 status. Wide individual variation in responses of the H2S biomarkers to such perturbations of human vitamin B6 status suggests that the resulting modulation of H2S production may have physiological consequences in a subset of people.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has anti-fibrotic potential in lung, kidney and other organs. The exogenous H2S is released from sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and can influence the renal fibrosis by blocking the differentiation of quiescent renal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. But whether H2S affects renal epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Our study is aimed at investigating the in vitro effects of H2S on transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1)-induced EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) and the associated mechanisms. The induced EMT is assessed by Western blotting analysis on the expressions of a-SMA, E-cadherin and fibronectin. HK-2 cells were treated with NaHS before incubating with TGF-ß1 to investigate its effect on EMT and the related molecular mechanism. Results demonstrated that NaHS decreased the expression of a-SMA and fibronectin, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. NaHS reduced the expression of TGF-ß receptor type I (TßR I) and TGF-ß receptor type II (TßR II). In addition, NaHS attenuated TGF-ß1-induced increase of ß-catenin expression and ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, it inhibited the TGF-ß1-induced nuclear translocation of ßß-catenin. These effects of NaHS on fibronectin, E-cadherin and TßR I were abolished by the ERK inhibitor U0126 or ß-catenin inhibitor XAV939, or ß-catenin siRNA interference. We get the conclusion that NaHS attenuated TGF-ß1-induced EMT in HK-2 cells through both ERK-dependent and ß-catenin-dependent pathways.

A discrepancy has been identified between numbers of expected and identified patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency. Patients homozygous for the frequent c.833T&gt;C (p.I278T) are most often responsive to vitamin B6, and can present with a total-homocysteine (tHcy) &lt;100 µM on a normal diet. In Denmark, patients with tHcy &lt;100 µM are not routinely sequenced for CBS(2) mutations. This study investigated the prevalence of CBS mutations and the common methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.677C&gt;T polymorphism in patients with tHcy = 50 µM and the association with clinical manifestations. We studied a cohort of patients with intermediate and severe hyperhomocysteinemia (tHcy = 50 µM) determined between 1996 and 2011. Among the 413 eligible patients, 184 (45%) patients agreed to participate in the present follow-up study. A MTHFR(3)c.677TT genotype was found in 49% of the patients. Eight patients were found to have mutations in CBS(2). Of those, two were homozygous for c.833T&gt;C (p.I278T), and four were compound heterozygous for c.833T&gt;C. One c.833T&gt;C (p.I278T) compound heterozygote was identified by lowering the threshold for sequencing from tHcy at 100 µM to 50 µM. The most prominent clinical presentation among patients with a CBS(2) mutation was thrombosis presenting at a median age of 25 years. In case of arterial or venous thrombosis without any explanation in individuals below 40 years, tHcy should be part of the thrombophilia screening. When tHcy is between 50 and 100 µM genotyping for the MTHFR(3) c.677TT is relevant, and when tHcy &gt;100 µM CBS should be genotyped.

INTRODUCTION: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a serious public health problem, due to its high mortality rate and worldwide rising incidence. OSCC susceptibility is mediated by interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Studies suggest that genetic variants encoding enzymes involved in folate metabolism may modulate OSCC risk by altering DNA synthesis/repair and methylation process.OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to evaluate the association of three genotypic polymorphism (MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C and CBS 844ins68) and oral cancer risk in southeastern Brazilians and evaluate the interactions between polymorphisms and clinical histopathological parameters.METHODS: This case-control study included 101 cases and 102 controls in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. MTHFR genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism) and CBS genotyping by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analysis.RESULTS: MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with lymph node involvement. Genotype CT+TT acted as a protective factor. MTHFR A1298C AC+CC genotype was associated with tumor differentiation, and possibly with a better prognosis. In risk analysis, no correlation was observed between genotypes and OSCC.CONCLUSION: We concluded that MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C and CBS 844ins68 polymorphisms were not associated with OSCC risk in southeastern Brazilians; however, we suggest a prognosis effect associated with MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in OSCC.

Immunohistochemical examination with the antiserum against neuronal NO synthase and cystathionine ß-synthase was used to study the following two pools of interneurons in Wistar rats at various periods after the development of renovascular hypertension: intranuclear interneurons (lying in the projection of the solitary nucleus, reticular gigantocellular nucleus, and parvocellular nucleus) and 2 groups of internuclear interneurons (small interneurons, area 50-300 µ(2); and large interneurons, area above 350 µ(2)). Intranuclear and internuclear interneurons probably play a role in the central mechanisms of hemodynamics regulation. These interneurons differ by not only in topochemical parameters, but also functional properties (different resistances to BP changes). Intranuclear interneurons are characterized by high sensitivity of the gas transmitter systems to a continuous increase in BP, which results in remodeling and dysfunction of the bulbar part of the cardiovascular center. Large internuclear interneurons demonstrate a strong reaction to BP rise, which confirms their involvement into hemodynamics regulation. By contrast, small internuclear interneurons retain their characteristics in arterial hypertension and probably perform an integrative function.

Hydrogen sulphide (H2S), the third endogenous gaseous signalling molecule, has attracted attention in biochemical research. The selective detection of H2S in living systems is essential for studying its functions. Fluorescence detection methods have become useful tools to explore the physiological roles of H2S because of their real-time and non-destructive characteristics. Herein we report a near-infrared fluorescent probe, NIR-HS, capable of tracking H2S in living organisms. With high sensitivity, good selectivity and low cytotoxicity, NIR-HS was able to recognize both the exogenous and endogenous H2S in living cells. More importantly, it realized the visualization of endogenous H2S generated in cells overexpressing cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), one of the enzymes responsible for producing endogenous H2S. The probe was also successfully applied to detect both the exogenous and endogenous H2S in living mice. The superior sensing properties of the probe render it a valuable research tool in the H2S-related medical research.

The metabolic pathway of purine nucleotides in parasitic protozoa is a potent drug target for treatment of parasitemia. Guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR), which catalyzes the deamination of guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), plays an important role in the interconversion of purine nucleotides to maintain the intracellular balance of their concentration. However, only a few studies on protozoan GMPR have been reported at present. Herein, we identified the GMPR in Trypanosoma brucei, a causative protozoan parasite of African trypanosomiasis, and found that the GMPR proteins were consistently localized to glycosomes in T. brucei bloodstream forms. We characterized its recombinant protein to investigate the enzymatic differences between GMPRs of T. brucei and its host animals. T. brucei GMPR was distinct in having an insertion of a tandem repeat of the cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domain, which was absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs. The recombinant protein of T. brucei GMPR catalyzed the conversion of GMP to IMP in the presence of NADPH, and showed apparent affinities for both GMP and NADPH different from those of its mammalian counterparts. Interestingly, the addition of monovalent cations such as K+ and NH4+ to the enzymatic reaction increased the GMPR activity of T. brucei, whereas none of the mammalian GMPR's was affected by these cations. The monophosphate form of the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibited T. brucei GMPR activity, though mammalian GMPRs showed no or only a little inhibition by it. These results suggest that the mechanism of the GMPR reaction in T. brucei is distinct from that in the host organisms. Finally, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting the availability of ribavirin to develop a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.

There is growing evidence to suggest that radiotherapy can paradoxically promote tumor invasion and metastatic processes, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, we found that exposure to X rays promoted cell invasion by triggering the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in two hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5. This was made evident by a reduced expression of E-cadherin and enhanced expressions of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail. Moreover, exposure to radiation stimulated the signaling of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a newly found gas transmitter, by upregulating the expressions of H2S-producing proteins of cysthionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS). Inhibition of CSE by siRNA or inhibitor not only increased the radiosensitivity but also strongly suppressed radiation-enhanced invasive properties of HCC cells. Interestingly, we found that H2S/CSE inhibition attenuated radiation-enhanced EMT, and the above effect was an end result of blockage of the radiation-activated pathway of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Collectively, our findings indicate that radiation could promote HCC cell invasion through EMT mediated by endogenous H2S/CSE signaling via the p38MAPK pathway.

A meta-analysis has suggested that vitamin D deficiency is involved in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and the levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are also decreased in type 2 diabetes. The injection of vitamin D induces cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) expression and H2S generation. However, it remains unclear whether the supplementation of vitamin D prevents DPN through improvement of CBS/H2S expression. In the present study, RSC96 cells, a rat Schwann cell line, were exposed to high glucose and methylglyoxal (HG&amp;MG) to simulate diabetic peripheral nerve injury in vivo. Before the exposure to HG&amp;MG, the cells were preconditioned with calcitriol (CCT), an active form of vitamin D, and then CCT-mediated neuroprotection was investigated in respect of cellular viability, superoxide anion (O2(-)) generation, inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS)/NO expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as CBS expression and activity. It was found that both high glucose and MGO decreased cell viability and co-treatment with the two induced a more serious injury in RSC96 cells. Therefore, the exposure to HG&amp;MG was used in the present study. The exposure to HG&amp;MG markedly induced iNOS expression, NO and O2(-) generation, as well as MMP loss. In addition, the exposure to HG&amp;MG depressed CBS expression and activity in RSC96 cells. However, the preconditioning with CCT significantly antagonized HG&amp;MG-induced cell injury including the decreased viability, iNOS overexpression, NO and O2(-) accumulation, as well as MMP loss. CCT also partially restored the decreased CBS expression and activity triggered by HG&amp;MG, while the inhibition of CBS with hydroxylamine attenuated CCT-mediated neuroprotection. Moreover, the exogenous donation of H2S produced similar cellular protective effects to CCT. The data indicate that the supplementation of vitamin D prevents HG&amp;MG-induced peripheral nerve injury involving the restoration of endogenous H2S system, which may provide a basal support for the treatment of DPN with vitamin D clinically.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of three different sources of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on sympathetic neurotransmission from isolated superfused bovine iris-ciliary bodies. The three agents under consideration were: ACS67, a hybrid of latanoprost and a H2S-donating moiety; L-cysteine, a substrate for endogenous production of H2S and GYY 4137, a slow donor of H2S. We also examined the contribution of prostaglandins to the pharmacological actions of the H2S donors on release of [(3)H]-norepinephrine ([(3)H]NE) triggered by electrical field stimulation. ACS67, L-cysteine and GYY 4137 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of electrically-evoked [(3)H]NE release from isolated bovine iris-ciliary bodies without affecting basal [(3)H]NE efflux. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen enhanced the inhibitory action of ACS67 and L-cysteine on stimulated [(3)H]NE release. Both aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of cystathionine-ß-synthase and glibenclamide, a KATP channel blocker reversed the inhibition of evoked NE release induced by the H2S donors. We conclude that H2S donors can inhibit sympathetic neurotransmission from isolated bovine iris-ciliary bodies, an effect partially dependent on the in situ production of H2S and prostanoids, and is mediated by an action on KATP channels.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) elicits pleiotropic physiological effects ranging from modulation of cardiovascular to CNS functions. A dominant method for transmission of sulfide-based signals is via posttranslational modification of reactive cysteine thiols to persulfides. However, the source of the persulfide donor and whether its relationship to H2S is as a product or precursor is controversial. The transsulfuration pathway enzymes can synthesize cysteine persulfide (Cys-SSH) from cystine and H2S from cysteine and/or homocysteine. Recently, Cys-SSH was proposed as the primary product of the transsulfuration pathway with H2S representing a decomposition product of Cys-SSH. Our detailed kinetic analyses demonstrate a robust capacity for Cys-SSH production by the human transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase and <U+03B3>-cystathionase (CSE) and for homocysteine persulfide synthesis from homocystine by CSE only. However, in the reducing cytoplasmic milieu where the concentration of reduced thiols is significantly higher than of disulfides, substrate level regulation favors the synthesis of H2S over persulfides. Mathematical modeling at physiologically relevant hepatic substrate concentrations predicts that H2S rather than Cys-SSH is the primary product of the transsulfuration enzymes with CSE being the dominant producer. The half-life of the metastable Cys-SSH product is short and decomposition leads to a mixture of polysulfides (Cys-S-(S)n-S-Cys). These in vitro data, together with the intrinsic reactivity of Cys-SSH for cysteinyl versus sulfur transfer, are consistent with the absence of an observable increase in protein persulfidation in cells in response to exogenous cystine and evidence for the formation of polysulfides under these conditions.

The cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) gene has been shown to be related to homocystinuria. This study was aimed to detect the mutations in CBS in a Han Chinese family with homocystinuria. A four-generation family from Shandong Province of China was recruited in this study. All available members of the family underwent comprehensive medical examinations. Genomic DNA was collected from peripheral blood of all the participants. The coding sequence of CBS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by direct DNA sequencing. Among all the family members, three affected individuals showed typical clinical features of homocystinuria. Two novel compound heterozygous mutations in the CBS gene, c.407T<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>C (p. L136P) and c.473C<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>T (p.A158V), were identified by sequencing analysis in this family. Both of the two missense mutations were detected in the three patients. Other available normal individuals, including the patients' parents, grand parents, her younger sister and brother in this family either carried one of the two mutations, or none. In addition, the two mutations were not found in 600 ethnically matched normal controls. This study provides a mutation spectrum of CBS resulting in homocystinuriain a Chinese population, which may shed light on the molecular pathogenesis and clinical diagnosis of CBS-associated homocystinuria.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency, well known as classical homocystinuria, is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of homocysteine and sulfur metabolism. CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine. The clinical features of untreated CBS deficiency include myopia, ectopia lentis, mental retardation, skeletal anomalies resembling Marfan syndrome, and thromboembolic events. Cerebral white matter lesions (CWMLs), identified in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are related to various clinical conditions including ischemia, inflammation, demyelination, infection, a tumor, and metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria. The presence of CWMLs is, however, believed to be a very rare condition in CBS-deficient patients. Herein, we report reversible CWMLs associated with hypermethioninemia caused by poor protein restriction and betaine therapy in a 21-year-old male with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency. T2-weighted images (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffuse high signal intensity in subcortical areas extending to the deep white matter. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed high signal intensity, while apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map demonstrated decreased ADC value in the lesions. The course of improvement after correct methionine restriction was successively followed by brain MRI. The CWMLs had regressed at 1 month after restriction, and disappeared after 5 months. ADC values were very low before proper methionine restriction, but normalized after 2 months. Use of betaine in the presence of elevated plasma methionine may increase the risk of reversible CWMLs in some CBS-deficient patients.

Aspergillus flavipes has received considerable interest due to its potential to produce therapeutic enzymes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism. In natural habitats, A. flavipes survives under sulfur limitations by mobilizing endogenous and exogenous sulfur to operate diverse cellular processes. Sulfur limitation affects virulence and pathogenicity, and modulates proteome of sulfur assimilating enzymes of several fungi. However, there are no previous reports aimed at exploring effects of sulfur limitation on the regulation of A. flavipes sulfur metabolism enzymes at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and proteomic levels. In this report, we show that sulfur limitation affects morphological and physiological responses of A. flavipes. Transcription and enzymatic activities of several key sulfur metabolism genes, ATP-sulfurylase, sulfite reductase, methionine permease, cysteine synthase, cystathionine ß- and <U+03B3>-lyase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase were increased under sulfur starvation conditions. A 50 kDa protein band was strongly induced by sulfur starvation, and the proteomic analyses of this protein band using LC-MS/MS revealed similarity to many proteins involved in the sulfur metabolism pathway.

The contributions of gasotransmitters to itch sensation are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a ubiquitous gasotransmitter, in itch signaling. We found that intradermal injection of H2S donors NaHS or Na2S, but not GYY4137 (a slow-releasing H2S donor), dose-dependently induced scratching behavior in a µ-opioid receptor-dependent and histamine-independent manner in mice. Interestingly, NaHS induced itch via unique mechanisms that involved capsaicin-insensitive A-fibers, but not TRPV1-expressing C-fibers that are traditionally considered for mediating itch, revealed by depletion of TRPV1-expressing C-fibers by systemic resiniferatoxin treatment. Moreover, local application of capsaizapine (TRPV1 blocker) or HC-030031 (TRPA1 blocker) had no effects on NaHS-evoked scratching. Strikingly, pharmacological blockade and silencing of Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel by mibefradil, ascorbic acid, zinc chloride or Cav3.2 siRNA dramatically decreased NaHS-evoked scratching. NaHS induced robust alloknesis (touch-evoked itch), which was inhibited by T-type calcium channels blocker mibefradil. Compound 48/80-induced itch was enhanced by an endogenous precursor of H2S (L-cysteine) but attenuated by inhibitors of H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and cystathionine ß-synthase. These results indicated that H2S, as a novel nonhistaminergic itch mediator, may activates Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel, probably located at A-fibers, to induce scratching and alloknesis in mice.

Cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme in the methionine and cysteine metabolic pathway, acting as a metabolic gatekeeper to regulate the flow of fixed sulfur from methionine to cysteine. Mutations in the CBS gene cause clinical CBS deficiency, a disease characterized by elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and methionine and decreased plasma cysteine. The treatment goal for CBS-deficient patients is to normalize the metabolic values of these three metabolites using a combination of vitamin therapy and dietary manipulation. To better understand the effectiveness of nutritional treatment strategies, we have performed a series of long-term dietary manipulation studies using our previously developed Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mouse model of CBS deficiency and sibling Tg-I278T Cbs(+/-) controls. Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice have undetectable levels of CBS activity, extremely elevated plasma tHcy, modestly elevated plasma methionine, and low plasma cysteine. They exhibit several easily assayable phenotypes, including osteoporosis, loss of fat mass, reduced life span, and facial alopecia. The diets used in these studies differed in the amounts of sulfur amino acids or sulfur amino acid precursors. In this review, we will discuss our findings and their relevance to CBS deficiency and the concept of gene-diet interaction.

Hypothermia and rewarming produces organ injury through the production of reactive oxygen species. We previously found that dopamine prevents hypothermia and rewarming-induced apoptosis in cultured cells through increased expression of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine ß-Synthase (CBS). Here, we investigate whether dopamine protects the kidney in deep body cooling and explore the role of H2S-producing enzymes in an in vivo rat model of deep hypothermia and rewarming. In anesthetized Wistar rats, body temperature was decreased to 15°C for 3h, followed by rewarming for 1h. Rats (n=5 per group) were treated throughout the procedure with vehicle or dopamine infusion, and in the presence or absence of a non-specific inhibitor of H2S-producing enzymes, amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA). Kidney damage and renal expression of three H2S-producing enzymes (CBS, CSE and 3-MST) was quantified and serum H2S level measured. Hypothermia and rewarming induced renal damage, evidenced by increased serum creatinine, renal reactive oxygen species production, KIM-1 expression and influx of immune cells, which was accompanied by substantially lowered renal expression of CBS, CSE, and 3-MST and lowered serum H2S levels. Infusion of dopamine fully attenuated renal damage and maintained expression of H2S-producing enzymes, while normalizing serum H2S. AOAA further decreased the expression of H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S level, and aggravated renal damage. Hence, dopamine preserves renal integrity during deep hypothermia and rewarming likely by maintaining the expression of renal H2S-producing enzymes and serum H2S.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme in human (patho)physiology with a central role in hydrogen sulfide metabolism. The enzyme is composed of a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-binding catalytic domain, flanked by the following two domains: a heme-binding N-terminal domain and a regulatory C-terminal domain binding S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet). CO or NO() binding at the ferrous heme negatively modulates the enzyme activity. Conversely, AdoMet binding stimulates CBS activity. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a functional communication between the two domains. We report that AdoMet binding significantly enhances CBS inhibition by CO. Consistently, we observed increased affinity (~5-fold) and faster association (~10-fold) of CO to the ferrous heme at physiological AdoMet concentrations. NO() binding to reduced CBS was also enhanced by AdoMet, although to a lesser extent (~2-fold higher affinity) as compared with CO. Importantly, CO and NO() binding was unchanged by AdoMet in a truncated form of CBS lacking the C-terminal regulatory domain. These unprecedented observations demonstrate that CBS activation by AdoMet puzzlingly sensitizes the enzyme toward inhibition by exogenous ligands, like CO and NO(). This further supports the notion that CBS regulation is a complex process, involving the concerted action of multiple physiologically relevant effectors.

BACKGROUND: Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) plays a crucial role as a cofactor in amino acid metabolism. There is a prevalence of moderate vitamin B-6 deficiency in the population that may be exacerbated through the ingestion of 1-amino d-proline (1ADP), a vitamin B-6 antagonist found in flaxseed.OBJECTIVE: Given prior evidence of the impact of synthetic 1ADP on indexes of pyridoxine metabolism, the current study was designed to investigate the effects of 1ADP derived from flaxseed on amino acid metabolism in moderately vitamin B-6-deficient rats.METHODS: Male weanling rats (n = 8/treatment) consumed a semipurified diet containing either 7 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride/kg diet [optimum vitamin B-6 (OB)] or 0.7 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride/kg diet [moderately vitamin B-6 deficient (MB)], each with 0 or 10 mg vitamin B-6 antagonist/kg diet, in either a synthetic form (1ADP) or as a flaxseed extract (FE), for 5 wk. At the end of the experiment, plasma vitamin B-6 and amino acid concentrations and the activities of hepatic PLP-dependent enzymes were analyzed.RESULTS: Compared with the MB control group, plasma PLP concentrations were 26% and 69% lower, respectively, in the MB+FE and MB+1ADP rats (P = 0.001). In the MB+FE group, the plasma cystathionine concentration was 100% greater and the plasma a-aminobutyric acid and glutamic acid concentrations were 59% and 30% lower, respectively, than in the MB control group. Both synthetic 1ADP and FE significantly (P &lt; 0.001) inhibited the in vitro hepatic activities of 2 PLP-dependent enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (up to 44%) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (up to 60%), irrespective of vitamin B-6 concentrations. Because of vitamin B-6 antagonist exposure, observed perturbations in plasma biomarkers and hepatic enzyme activities were not evident or of lesser magnitude in rats consuming adequate vitamin B-6.CONCLUSION: The current data from a rat model provide evidence that a vitamin B-6 antagonist now prevalent in the human food supply may pose challenges to individuals of moderate vitamin B-6 status.

This study was aimed at investigating the effects of quercetin on mRNA expression and activity of critical enzymes in homocysteine metabolism in rats fed a methionine-enriched diet. Rats were fed for 6 weeks the following diets, that is, control, 0.5% quercetin, 1.0% methionine, and 1.0% methionine plus 0.5% quercetin diets. Serum homocysteine was significantly increased after methionine treatment and decreased after the addition of quercetin. The mRNA expression of methionine synthase was significantly increased after methionine or methionine plus quercetin supplementation, while its enzymatic activity was significantly increased after methionine plus quercetin supplementation. The mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase were upregulated after quercetin, methionine, or quercetin plus methionine treatment and a more significant increase was observed for hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase in the methionine plus quercetin treated rats, suggesting an interaction between methionine and quercetin. Meanwhile, hepatic ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine was significantly decreased in response to methionine supplementation and normalized after the addition of quercetin. It is concluded that quercetin reduces serum homocysteine by increasing remethylation and transsulfuration of homocysteine in rats exposed to a methionine-enriched diet.

CO is a gaseous mediator generated by HO. Our previous studies revealed that CO generated from inducible HO-1 or from constitutive HO-2 modulates function of different heme proteins or enzymes through binding to their prosthetic ferrous heme to alter their structures, regulating biological function of cells and organs. Such CO-directed target macromolecules include sGC and CBS. In the liver, CO serves as a sinusoidal dilator through its action on sGC in hepatic stellate cells, while the same gas accounts for vasoconstrictor that inhibits H2S generated by CO-sensitive CBS in astrocytes. Since molecular O2 is a substrate for HO, the latter mechanism contributes to hypoxic vasodilation in neurovascular units. We have recently uncovered that stress-inducible CO in and around cancer cells suppresses CBS to result in decreased methylation of PFKFB3, the enzyme regulating PFK-1, leading to a shift of glucose biotransformation from glycolysis toward pentose phosphate pathway; such a metabolic remodeling causes chemoresistance through increasing NADPH and reduced glutathione under stress conditions for cancer cells. This article reviews the intriguing networks of CO-sensitive metabolic regulatory mechanisms in microcirculation and cancer.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate serum levels of the target enzyme for H2S toxicity--cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and enzymes involved in the synthesis of H2S--cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in copper mine miners.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The initial and basic study was conducted respectively in 237 and 88 miners, working in 2 mining shafts: I--no H2S emissions recorded in the last 10 years (study group A) and II--H2S emissions occurred (study group B). A medical examination was performed and 10 ml of blood was collected from miners immediately after exiting the mine.RESULTS: There were no clinical or biochemical changes typical for H2S toxicity. Sulfhemoglobine was undetectable and there were no changes in the red-ox system. However, in group B, regulatory changes were found; a tendency to higher concentration of CBS and CSE, a higher activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) compared to group A (p&lt;0.05) and a linear relationship between ACE and CSE (r=0.6927; p&lt;0.001). It has been shown that cigarette smoking decreases COX (p&lt;0.05), however, in miners working in shaft II, the decreased level of COX may result also from the presence of H2S in the gaseous emissions.CONCLUSIONS: COX concentration can be a sensitive indicator of exposure to H2S. The measurements of blood H2S concentrations carried out in workplaces should explain the cause of the changes observed in the COX, CBS and CSE activity.Celem badan byla ocena stezenia mitochondrialnego enzymu docelowego dla toksycznego dzialania siarkowodoru, tj. oksydazy cytochromu c (COX) oraz enzymów uczestniczacych w syntezie endogennego H2S (siarkowodoru)  syntazy ß-cystationiny (CBS) i <U+03B3>-liazy cystationiny (CSE) w surowicy górników kopalni miedzi.</AbstractText>: Celem badan byla ocena stezenia mitochondrialnego enzymu docelowego dla toksycznego dzialania siarkowodoru, tj. oksydazy cytochromu c (COX) oraz enzymów uczestniczacych w syntezie endogennego H2S (siarkowodoru)  syntazy ß-cystationiny (CBS) i <U+03B3>-liazy cystationiny (CSE) w surowicy górników kopalni miedzi.Badanie wstepne przeprowadzono u 237 górników, a zasadnicze u 88 górników zatrudnionych w 2 szybach: I  bez zarejestrowanych emisji H2S w ciagu ostatnich 10 lat (grupa badana A); II  w którym wystepowaly emisje H2S (grupa badana B).

H2S is produced mainly by two enzymes:cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), using L-cysteine (L-Cys) as the substrate. In this study, we investigated the role of H2S in gastric accommodation using CBS(+/-) mice, immunohistochemistry, immunoblot, methylene blue assay, intragastric pressure (IGP) recording and electrical field stimulation (EFS). Mouse gastric fundus expressed H2S-generating enzymes (CBS and CSE) and generated detectable amounts of H2S. The H2S donor, NaHS or L-Cys, caused a relaxation in either gastric fundus or body. The gastric compliance was significantly increased in the presence of L-Cys (1<U+2009>mM). On the contrary, AOAA, an inhibitor for CBS, largely inhibited gastric compliance. Consistently, CBS(+/-) mice shows a lower gastric compliance. However, PAG, a CSE inhibitor, had no effect on gastric compliances. L-Cys enhances the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxation of fundus strips, but AOAA reduces the magnitude of relaxations to EFS. Notably, the expression level of CBS but not CSE protein was elevated after feeding. Consistently, the production of H2S was also increased after feeding in mice gastric fundus. In addition, AOAA largely reduced food intake and body weight in mice. Furthermore, a metabolic aberration of H2S was found in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). In conclusion, endogenous H2S, a novel gasotransmitter, involves in gastric accommodation.

The pathogenesis of pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is poorly understood and treatment remains difficult. The present study was designed to investigate roles of adrenergic signaling and the endogenous hydrogen sulfide producing enzyme cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) in a previously validated rat model of IBS induced by neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI). Here we showed that NCI-induced visceral hypersensitivity (VH) was significantly attenuated by ß2 subunit inhibitor but not by ß1 or ß3 or a subunit inhibitor. NCI markedly elevated plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration without alteration in expression of ß2 subunit receptors in dorsal root ganglion (DRGs) innervating the colon. In addition, NCI markedly enhanced TRPV1 and CBS expression in the colon DRGs. CBS inhibitor AOAA reversed the upregulation of TRPV1 in NCI rats. In vitro experiments showed that incubation of DRG cells with NE markedly enhanced expression of TRPV1, which was reversed by application of AOAA. Incubation of DRG cells with the H2S donor NaHS greatly enhanced TRPV1 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that activation of adrenergic signaling by NCI sensitizes TRPV1 channel activity, which is likely mediated by upregulation of CBS expression in peripheral sensory neurons, thus contributing to chronic visceral hypersensitivity.

Plasma homocysteine, a metabolite involved in key cellular methylation processes seems to be implicated in cognitive functions and cardiovascular health with its high levels representing a potential modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. A better understanding of the genetic factors regulating homocysteine levels, particularly in non-white populations, may help in risk stratification analyses of existing clinical trials and may point to novel targets for homocysteine-lowering therapy. To identify genetic influences on plasma homocysteine levels in individuals with African ancestry, we performed a targeted gene and pathway-based analysis using a priori biological information and then to identify new association performed a genome-wide association study. All analyses used combined data from the African American and Yoruba cohorts from the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project. Targeted analyses demonstrated significant associations of homocysteine and variants within the CBS (Cystathionine beta-Synthase) gene. We identified a novel genome-wide significant association of the AD risk gene CD2AP (CD2-associated protein) with plasma homocysteine levels in both cohorts. Minor allele (T) carriers of identified CD2AP variant (rs6940729) exhibited decreased homocysteine level. Pathway enrichment analysis identified several interesting pathways including the GABA receptor activation pathway. This is noteworthy given the known antagonistic effect of homocysteine on GABA receptors. These findings identify several new targets warranting further investigation in relation to the role of homocysteine in neurodegeneration.

The Mediterranean diet is known for its cardioprotective effects. Recently, its protective qualities have also been reported in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oxidative stress is one of the important factors responsible for the development and progression of NAFLD. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a multifaceted gasotransmitter, has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in NAFLD. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) are major enzymes responsible for endogenous H2S synthesis. Since oxidative stress contributes to NAFLD pathogenesis, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of tyrosol, a major compound in olive oil and white wine, on high fat diet-induced hepatic oxidative stress and the mechanisms involved. Mice (C57BL/6) were fed for 5 weeks with a control diet (10 % kcal fat), a high fat diet (60 % kcal fat, HFD) or a HFD supplemented with tyrosol. High fat diet feeding induced hepatic oxidative stress, as indicated by the significant increase in lipid peroxidation and NADPH oxidase activity. Tyrosol supplementation significantly increased hepatic CBS and CSE expression and H2S synthesis in high fat diet-fed mice. Such effects were associated with the attenuation of high fat diet-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation and the restoration of the redox equilibrium of the antioxidant glutathione. Tyrosol also inhibited palmitic acid-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes (HepG2 cells). These results suggest that the antioxidant properties of tyrosol may be mediated through functional changes in CBS and CSE activity, which might contribute to the hepatoprotective effect of the Mediterranean diet.

Sepsis is the systemic inflammatory host response to infection. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)-dependent homocysteine (Hcy) pathway was demonstrated to affect disease severity and mortality in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Independent studies identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs6586282, hg19 chr21:g.44478497C&gt;T) in intron 14 of the CBS-coding gene (CBS) associated with Hcy plasma levels. We aimed to describe the association of this SNP and variants of a splice donor-affecting variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR, NG_008938.1:g.22763_22793[16_22]) 243<U+2009>bp downstream of rs6586282 with severe human sepsis. We analyzed the VNTR structure and genotyped variants of rs6586282 and a neighboring SNP (rs34758144, hg19 chr21:g.44478582G&gt;A) in two case-control studies including patients with severe sepsis/septic shock from Germany (n=168) and Greece (n=237). In both studies, we consistently observed an association of CBS VNTR alleles with sepsis susceptibility. Risk linearly increased with number of tandem repeats (per allele odds ratio in the adjusted analysis 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.17-1.55; P&lt;0.001). Association had also been shown for rs34758144 whose risk allele is in linkage disequilibrium with one long VNTR allele (19 repeat). In contrast, we observed no evidence for an effect on 28-day survival in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock (per allele hazard ratio in the adjusted analysis for VNTR 1.10; 95% CI=0.95-1.28; P=0.20). In a minigene approach, we demonstrated alternative splicing in distinct VNTR alleles, which, however, was independent of the number of tandem units. In conclusion, there is no ordinary conjunction between human CBS and severe sepsis/septic shock, but CBS genotypes are involved in disease susceptibility.

In the present study, we analysed a 31bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of the cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) gene in 427 subjects: 127 patients with Down syndrome (DS) and in 60 of their mothers; 172 age-and sex-matched controls and in 68 of their mothers. A significant statistical difference in the distribution of the 21 repeat allele was found comparing mothers of subjects with DS versus mothers of children without DS (<U+03C7>2= 4.166; P = 0.0413; Table 2). Since CBS 21 repeats allele carriers show a decrease of CBS enzyme activity possibly leading to lower intracellular glutathione concentration, these results could be explained by a higher not disjunction probability of chromosome 21 in oocytes, due to poor antioxidative protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) toxic activity.

The key regulatory point of L-methionine (Met) and L-homocysteine (Hcy) degradation is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). CBS deficiency is caused by mutations in CBS gene, often resulting in protein misfolding. The prevalence of CBS deficiency in Qatar is 1/1800, ~200-fold higher than the worldwide prevalence of 1/344 000. Almost all patients bear the CBS p.R336C variant. More than 20 years ago, it was shown in vitro that two unrelated protein variants with a substitution of an arginine (Arg) residue by cysteine (Cys) could be rescued by cysteamine (mercaptoethylamine), likely via formation of a disulfide between Cys and cysteamine, functionally mimicking the wild-type (WT) Arg side-chain. Based on these findings, we aimed to study whether cysteamine was able to improve the function of p.R336C CBS variant. Additionally, we tested the effect of mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG), a compound with a guanidino and a thiol function that may resemble Arg structure better than cysteamine. Three purified recombinant CBS proteins (p.R336C, p.R336H and WT) were pre-incubated with cysteamine, MEG or Cys (as negative control), and CBS activity and stability were measured. Pre-incubation with cysteamine and MEG increased the enzymatic activity of the p.R336C protein, which was absent upon pre-incubation with Cys. The WT and the p.R336H variant enzyme activity presented no increase with any of the tested compounds. Our results show that cysteamine and MEG are able to specifically improve the function of the CBS p.R336C variant, suggesting that any Arg-to-Cys substitution accessible to these small molecules may be converted back to a moiety resembling Arg.

Hydrogen sulfide is an endogenous gasotransmitter and its mechanism of action involves activation of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels and phosphodiesterase inhibition. As both mechanisms are potentially involved in malignant hyperthermia (MH), in the present study we addressed the involvement of the L-cysteine/hydrogen sulfide pathway in MH. Skeletal muscle biopsies obtained from 25 MH-susceptible (MHS) and 56 MH-negative (MHN) individuals have been used to perform the in vitro contracture test (IVCT). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting studies have also been performed. Hydrogen sulfide levels are measured in both tissue samples and plasma. In MHS biopsies an increase in cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) occurs, as both mRNA and protein expression compared with MHN biopsies. Hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis is increased in MHS biopsies (0.128±0.12 compared with 0.943±0.13 nmol/mg of protein per min for MHN and MHS biopsies, respectively; P&lt;0.01). Addition of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) to MHS samples evokes a response similar, in the IVCT, to that elicited by either caffeine or halothane. Incubation of MHN biopsies with NaHS, before caffeine or halothane challenge, switches an MHN to an MHS response. In conclusion we demonstrate the involvement of the L-cysteine/hydrogen sulfide pathway in MH, giving new insight into MH molecular mechanisms. This finding has potential implications for clinical care and could help to define less invasive diagnostic procedures.

Hydrogen sulfide, one of three known gasotransmitters, is involved in physiological processes, including reproductive functions. Oocyte maturation and surrounding cumulus cell expansion play an essential role in female reproduction and subsequent embryonic development. Although the positive effects of exogenous hydrogen sulfide on maturing oocytes are well known, the role of endogenous hydrogen sulfide, which is physiologically released by enzymes, has not yet been described in oocytes. In this study, we observed the presence of Cystathionine ß-Synthase (CBS), Cystathionine <U+03B3>-Lyase (CTH) and 3-Mercaptopyruvate Sulfurtransferase (3-MPST), hydrogen sulfide-releasing enzymes, in porcine oocytes. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide production was detected in immature and matured oocytes as well as its requirement for meiotic maturation. Individual hydrogen sulfide-releasing enzymes seem to be capable of substituting for each other in hydrogen sulfide production. However, meiosis suppression by inhibition of all hydrogen sulfide-releasing enzymes is not irreversible and this effect is a result of M-Phase/Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) activity inhibition. Futhermore, cumulus expansion expressed by hyaluronic acid (HA) production is affected by the inhibition of hydrogen sulfide production. Moreover, quality changes of the expanded cumuli are indicated. These results demonstrate hydrogen sulfide involvement in oocyte maturation as well as cumulus expansion. As such, hydrogen sulfide appears to be an important cell messenger during mammalian oocyte meiosis and adequate cumulus expansion.

Oxidative stress and inflammation play crucial role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Most patients with COPD show a poor response to corticosteroids. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S ) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, but its expression and effects in lung tissue from COPD patients are not clear. In peripheral lung tissue samples from 24 patients, we found that compared with nonsmokers, the protein level of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) was decreased in smokers and COPD patients. CSE mRNA increased but cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) mRNA decreased in COPD patients. H2S donors increased glutathione and superoxide dismutase in CS exposed U937 cells and inhibited CS-induced TNF-a and IL-8 secretion. Dexamethasone alone had no effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced TNF-a release by alveolar macrophages from CS exposed rats, however the combination of dexamethasone and H2S donor significantly inhibited TNF-a release. Thus, H2S metabolism is altered in lung tissue of smokers and COPD patients. Supplementation of H2S protects against CS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in macrophages and H2S on steroid sensitivity deserves further investigation.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced enzymatically by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), as well as other enzymes in mammalian tissues. These discoveries have led to the crowning of H2S as yet another toxic gas that serves as a gasotransmitter like NO and CO. H2S is thought to exert its biological effects through its reaction with cysteine thiols in proteins, yielding sulfurated thiol (-SSH) derivatives. One of the first proteins shown to be modified by H2S was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [1] where the S-sulfuration of the active site cysteine (Cys 152) resulted in ~7-fold increase in the activity of the enzyme. In the present study we have attempted to reproduce this result with no success. GAPDH in its reduced, or hydrogen peroxide, or glutathione disulfide, or nitrosonium oxidized forms was reacted with sulfide or polysulfides. Sulfide had no effect on reduced GAPDH activity, while polysulfides inhibited GAPDH to ~42% of control. S-sulfuration of GAPDH occurred at Cys 247 after sulfide treatment, Cys 156 and Cys 247 after polysulfide treatment. No evidence of S-sulfuration at active site Cys 152 was discovered. Both sulfide and polysulfide was able to restore the activity of glutathione disulfide oxidized GAPDH, but not to control untreated levels. Treatment of glutathione disulfide oxidized GAPDH with polysulfide also produced S-sulfuration of Cys 156. Treatment of a C156S mutant of GAPDH with sulfide and polysulfide resulted in S-sulfuration of Cys 152, which also caused a decrease and not an increase in enzymatic activity. Computational chemistry shows S-sulfuration of Cys 156 may affect the position of catalytic Cys 152, raising its pKa by 0.5, which may affect the nucleophilicity of Cys 152. The current study raises significant questions about the reported ability of H2S to activate GAPDH by the sulfuration of its active site thiol, and indicates that polysulfide is a stronger protein S-sulfurating agent than sulfide.

Elevated lipid metabolism is implicated in poor survival in ovarian cancer (OC) and other cancers; however, current lipogenesis-targeting strategies lack cancer cell specificity. Here, we identify a novel role of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a sulphur amino acid metabolizing enzyme highly expressed in several ovarian cancer cell lines, in driving deregulated lipid metabolism in OC. We examined the role of CBS in regulation of triglycerides, cholesterol and lipogenic enzymes via the lipogenic transcription factors SREBP1 and SREBP2. CBS silencing attenuated the expression of number of key enzymes involved in lipid synthesis (FASN and ACC1). Additionally CBS abrogates lipid uptake in OC cells. Gene silencing of CBS or SREBPs abrogated cellular migration and invasion in OC, while ectopic expression of SREBPs can rescue phenotypic effects of CBS silencing by restoring cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, CBS represses SREBP1 and SREBP2 at the transcription levels by modulating the transcription factor Sp1. We further established the roles of both CBS and SREBPs in regulating ovarian tumor growth in vivo. In orthotopic tumor models, CBS or SREBP silencing resulted in reduced tumor cells proliferation, blood vessels formation and lipid content. Hence, cancer-selective disruption of the lipid metabolism pathway is possible by targeting CBS and, at least for OC, promises a profound benefit.

INTRODUCTION: Resveratrol (RVT) found in red wine protects against erectile dysfunction and relaxes penile tissue (corpus cavernosum) via a nitric oxide (NO) independent pathway. However, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a potent vasodilator and neuromodulator generated in corpus cavernosum.AIMS: We investigated whether RVT caused the relaxation of mice corpus cavernosum (MCC) through H2 S.METHODS: H2 S formation is measured by methylene blue assay and vascular reactivity experiments have been performed by DMT strip myograph in CD1 MCC strips.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N<U+03C9>-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 0.1<U+2009>mM) or H2 S inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA, 2<U+2009>mM) which inhibits both cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) enzyme or combination of AOAA with PAG (CSE inhibitor) has been used in the presence/absence of RVT (0.1<U+2009>mM, 30<U+2009>min) to elucidate the role of NO or H2 S pathways on the effects of RVT in MCC. Concentration-dependent relaxations to RVT, L-cysteine, sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) and acetylcholine (ACh) were studied.RESULTS: Exposure of murine corpus cavernosum to RVT increased both basal and L-cysteine-stimulated H2 S formation. Both of these effects were reversed by AOAA but not by L-NNA. RVT caused concentration-dependent relaxation of MCC and that RVT-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG but not by L-NNA. L-cysteine caused concentration-dependent relaxations, which are inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG significantly. Incubation of MCC with RVT significantly increased L-cysteine-induced relaxation, and this effect was inhibited by AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG. However, RVT did not alter the effect of exogenous H2 S (NaHS) or ACh-induced relaxations.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that RVT-induced relaxation is at least partly dependent on H2 S formation and acts independent of eNOS pathway. In phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) nonresponder population, combination therapy with RVT may reverse erectile dysfunction via stimulating endogenous H2 S formation.

BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria is a rare inherited disorder due to a deficiency in cystathionine beta synthase. Individuals with this condition appear normal at birth but develop serious complications in childhood. Diagnosis and treatment started sufficiently early in life can effectively prevent or reduce the severity of these complications. This is an update of a previously published review.OBJECTIVES: To determine if newborn population screening for the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency leads to clinical benefit compared to later clinical diagnosis.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register.Date of the most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 08 June 2015.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials assessing the use of any neonatal screening test to diagnose infants with homocystinuria before the condition becomes clinically evident. Eligible studies compare a screened population versus a non-screened population.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.MAIN RESULTS: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify eligible studies for inclusion in this review and hence it is not possible to draw any conclusions based on controlled studies; however, we are aware of uncontrolled case-series which support the efficacy of newborn screening for homocystinuria and its early treatment. Any future randomised controlled trial would need to be both multicentre and long term in order to provide robust evidence for or against screening and to allow a cost effectiveness analysis to be undertaken.

The overexpression of cystathionine ß-synthase is thought to participate in the presentation of some phenotypes observed in Down syndrome.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the expression levels of cystathionine ß-synthase and histopathological observations from placentas of infants with Down syndrome and healthy newborns.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six placentas of fetuses/infants with Down syndrome and sixteen placentas of healthy fetuses were studied. Cystathionine ß-synthase mRNA and protein expression were performed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively.RESULTS: We observed an increase in cystathionine ß-synthase mRNA expression (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0465) and protein levels (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.009) in placentas of fetus/infants with Down syndrome compared with controls. Significantly more circinate edges (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0007) and trophoblast inclusions (p<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.0037) were observed in the group with Down syndrome compared with control group.CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate overexpression of cystathionine ß-synthase mRNA and protein in placentas of fetuses/infants with trisomy 21. Further histological abnormalities were found in placentas of patients with Down syndrome, suggesting an alteration in the development of placenta.

Deficiencies of the human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) enzyme are characterized by a plethora of vascular disorders and hyperhomocysteinemia. However, several clinical trials demonstrated that despite reduction in homocysteine levels, disease outcome remained unaffected, thus the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is poorly defined. Here, we show that the loss of CBS function in endothelial cells (ECs) leads to a significant down-regulation of cellular hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by 50% and of glutathione (GSH) by 40%. Silencing CBS in ECs compromised phenotypic and signaling responses to the VEGF that were potentiated by decreased transcription of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and neuropilin (NRP)-1, the primary receptors regulating endothelial function. Transcriptional down-regulation of VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 was mediated by a lack in stability of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which is a sulfhydration target of H2S at residues Cys68 and Cys755. Reinstating H2S but not GSH in CBS-silenced ECs restored Sp1 levels and its binding to the VEGFR-2 promoter and VEGFR-2, NRP-1 expression, VEGF-dependent proliferation, and migration phenotypes. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of CBS-mediated protein S-sulfhydration in maintaining vascular health and function.-Saha, S., Chakraborty, P. K., Xiong, X., Dwivedi, S. K. D., Mustafi, S.

Oxidative stress plays an important role in cardiovascular diseases. The study investigated the effects of dietary palm tocotrienol-rich fraction on homocysteine metabolism in rats fed a high-methionine diet. Forty-two male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to six groups. Five groups were fed with high-methionine diet (1%) for 10 weeks. Groups 2 to 5 were also given dietary folate (8 mg/kg) and three doses of palm tocotrienol-rich fraction (30, 60 and 150 mg/kg) from week 6 to week 10. The last group was only given basal rat chow. High-methionine diet increased plasma homocysteine after 10 weeks, which was prevented by the supplementations of folate and high-dose palm tocotrienol-rich fraction. Hepatic S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) content was unaffected in all groups but S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) content was reduced in the folate group. Folate supplementation increased the SAM/SAH ratio, while in the palm tocotrienol-rich fraction groups, the ratio was lower compared with the folate. Augmented activity of hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase and lipid peroxidation content by high-methionine diet was inhibited by palm tocotrienol-rich fraction supplementations (moderate and high doses), but not by folate. The supplemented groups had lower hepatic lipid peroxidation than the high-methionine diet. In conclusion, palm tocotrienol-rich fraction reduced high-methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinaemia possibly by reducing hepatic oxidative stress in high-methionine-fed rats. It may also exert a direct inhibitory effect on hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase.

Among numerous proteins containing pairs of regulatory cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains, family II pyrophosphatases (CBS-PPases) are unique in that they generally contain an additional DRTGG domain between the CBS domains. Adenine nucleotides bind to the CBS domains in CBS-PPases in a positively cooperative manner, resulting in enzyme inhibition (AMP or ADP) or activation (ATP). Here we show that linear P(1),P(n)-diadenosine 5'-polyphosphates (ApnAs, where n is the number of phosphate residues) bind with nanomolar affinity to DRTGG domain-containing CBS-PPases of Desulfitobacterium hafniense, Clostridium novyi, and Clostridium perfringens and increase their activity up to 30-, 5-, and 7-fold, respectively. Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A bound noncooperatively and with similarly high affinities to CBS-PPases, whereas Ap3A bound in a positively cooperative manner and with lower affinity, like mononucleotides. All ApnAs abolished kinetic cooperativity (non-Michaelian behavior) of CBS-PPases. The enthalpy change and binding stoichiometry, as determined by isothermal calorimetry, were ~10 kcal/mol nucleotide and 1 mol/mol enzyme dimer for Ap4A and Ap5A but 5.5 kcal/mol and 2 mol/mol for Ap3A, AMP, ADP, and ATP, suggesting different binding modes for the two nucleotide groups. In contrast, Eggerthella lenta and Moorella thermoacetica CBS-PPases, which contain no DRTGG domain, were not affected by ApnAs and showed no enthalpy change, indicating the importance of the DTRGG domain for ApnA binding. These findings suggest that ApnAs can control CBS-PPase activity and hence affect pyrophosphate level and biosynthetic activity in bacteria.

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a nonproteogenic sulfur containing amino acid derived from dietary methionine through demethylation. Homocysteine can be re-methylated to methionine [precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)] via the re-methylation or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pathway or undergoes transsulfuration to form cysteine by the action of metabolic enzymes and cofactors. Impaired metabolism due to genetic alteration in metabolic enzymes (methionine synthase, methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS), and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (C<U+03B3>L) or deficiency in cofactors (vitamin B6 , B12 , folate) may lead to acquired metabolic anomaly known as hyperhomocysteinemia. Hcy excess decreases the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent synthesis of catecholamines, viz. dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and noncatecholamine, viz. serotonin (5-HT), due to genetic alteration in key enzyme MTHFR in the homocysteine metabolism pathway that leads to depression. Thus, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced SAM level is influenced by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MTHFR C677T. Furthermore, HHcy leads to production of precarious neurotoxic product homocysteic acid (HCA) and cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) which acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and has neurotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons. In the current review, an attempt has been made to discuss the neurotoxic effects of HHcy in the pathogenesis of depression.

Urothelium, the epithelial lining the inner surface of human bladder, plays a key role in bladder physiology and pathology. It responds to chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli by releasing several factors and mediators. Recently it has been shown that hydrogen sulfide contributes to human bladder homeostasis. Hydrogen sulfide is mainly produced in human bladder by the action of cystathionine-ß-synthase. Here, we demonstrate that human cystathionine-ß-synthase activity is regulated in a cGMP/PKG-dependent manner through phosphorylation at serine 227. Incubation of human urothelium or T24 cell line with 8-Bromo-cyclic-guanosine monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) but not dibutyryl-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (d-cAMP) causes an increase in hydrogen sulfide production. This result is congruous with the finding that PKG is robustly expressed but PKA only weakly present in human urothelium as well as in T24 cells. The cGMP/PKG-dependent phosphorylation elicited by 8-Br-cGMP is selectively reverted by KT5823, a specific PKG inhibitor. Moreover, the silencing of cystathionine-ß-synthase in T24 cells leads to a marked decrease in hydrogen sulfide production either in basal condition or following 8-Br-cGMP challenge. In order to identify the phosphorylation site, recombinant mutant proteins of cystathionine-ß-synthase in which Ser32, Ser227 or Ser525 was mutated in Ala were generated. The Ser227Ala mutant cystathionine-ß-synthase shows a notable reduction in basal biosynthesis of hydrogen sulfide becoming unresponsive to the 8-Br-cGMP challenge. A specific antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of cystathionine-ß-synthase has been produced and validated by using T24 cells and human urothelium. In conclusion, human cystathionine-ß-synthase can be phosphorylated in a PKG-dependent manner at Ser227 leading to an increased catalytic activity.

Vascular bed calcification is a common feature of ends stage renal disease that may lead to a complication in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular beds, which is a promoting cause of myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia and aneurysms. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) due to its multiple properties such as antioxidant and calcium chelation has been reported to prevent vascular calcification in uremic rats, without mentioning its impact on cerebral function. Moreover, the previous studies have not explored the effect of STS on the mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the main pathophysiological features associated with the disease and the main site for STS metabolism. The present study addresses this limitation by using a rat model where 0.75% adenine was administered to induce vascular calcification and 400 mg/kg b wt. of STS was given as preventive and curative agent. The blood and urine chemistries along with histopathology of aorta confirms the renal protective effect of STS in two modes of administration. The brain oxidative stress assessment was made through TBARS level, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, found to be in the near normal level. STS administration not only reduced the mitochondrial oxidative stress (measured by TBARS, SOD, GPx and CAT) but also preserved the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities (NADH dehydrogenase, Succinate dehydrogenase and Malate dehydrogenase) and its physiology (measured by P/O ratio and RCR). In fact, the protective effect of STS was prominent, when it was administered as a curative agent, where low H2S and high thiosulfate level was observed along with low cystathionine ß synthase activity, confirms thiosulfate mediated renal protection. In conclusion, STS when given after induction of calcification is protective to the brain by preserving its mitochondria, compared to the treatment given concomitantly.

The two signaling molecules H2 S and H2 O2 play key roles in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis. The biological relationship between H2 O2 and H2 S remains largely unknown in redox biology. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized single- and dual-response fluorescent probes for detecting both H2 O2 and H2 S in living cells. The dual-response probe was shown to be capable of mono- and dual-detection of H2 O2 and H2 S selectively and sensitively. Detailed bioimaging studies based on the probes revealed that both exogenous and endogenous H2 O2 could induce H2 S biogenesis in living cells. By using gene-knockdown techniques with bioimaging, the H2 S biogenesis was found to be majorly cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-dependent. Our finding shows the first direct evidence on the biological communication between H2 O2 (ROS) and H2 S (RSS) in vivo.

Wistar rats were subjected to renovascular hypertension. Then, we studied two pools of neurons: intranuclear neurons located in projection area of the solitary tract nucleus and reticular, magnocellular, and parvicellular nuclei; and two groups of internuclear neurons, which included both small neurons 50-300 µm(2) in size and large neurons more than 350 µm(2) in size. Immunohistochemical methods with antisera against neuronal nitric oxide synthase, cystathionine-ß-synthase, and heme oxygenase-2 were used. The studies were performed 8, 16, and 24 weeks after the development of renovascular hypertension. We have found that at least two pools of interneurons, intra- and internuclear cells, may be involved in the mechanisms of regulation of hemodynamics. These pools of interneurons differ in some topochemical and functional features, including different resistances to an increased blood pressure.

Methionine metabolism plays a central role in methylation reactions, production of glutathione and methylarginines, and modulating homocysteine levels. The mechanisms by which these are affected in NAFLD are not fully understood. The aim is to perform a metabolomic, molecular and epigenetic analyses of hepatic methionine metabolism in diet-induced NAFLD. Female 129S1/SvlmJ;C57Bl/6J mice were fed a chow (n = 6) or high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet (n = 8) for 52 weeks. Metabolomic study, enzymatic expression and DNA methylation analyses were performed. HFHC diet led to weight gain, marked steatosis and extensive fibrosis. In the methionine cycle, hepatic methionine was depleted (30%, p&lt; 0.01) while s-adenosylmethionine (SAM)/methionine ratio (p&lt; 0.05), s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (35%, p&lt; 0.01) and homocysteine (25%, p&lt; 0.01) were increased significantly. SAH hydrolase protein levels decreased significantly (p &lt;0.01). Serine, a substrate for both homocysteine remethylation and transsulfuration, was depleted (45%, p&lt; 0.01). In the transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine and cysteine trended upward while glutathione decreased significantly (p&lt; 0.05). In the transmethylation pathway, levels of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most abundant methyltransferase in the liver, decreased. The phosphatidylcholine (PC)/ phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio increased significantly (p&lt; 0.01), indicative of increased phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) activity. The protein levels of protein arginine methytransferase 1 (PRMT1) increased significantly, but its products, monomethylarginine (MMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), decreased significantly. Circulating ADMA increased and approached significance (p&lt; 0.06). Protein expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A, cystathionine ß-synthase, <U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthetase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, and methionine synthase remained unchanged. Although gene expression of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a decreased, the global DNA methylation was unaltered. Among individual genes, only HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr) was hypermethylated, and no methylation changes were observed in fatty acid synthase (Fasn), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (Nf<U+03BA>b1), c-Jun, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Caspase 3. NAFLD was associated with hepatic methionine deficiency and homocysteine elevation, resulting mainly from impaired homocysteine remethylation, and aberrancy in methyltransferase reactions. Despite increased PRMT1 expression, hepatic ADMA was depleted while circulating ADMA was increased, suggesting increased export to circulation.

It is well known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) protects the gastric mucosa against gastric acid and other noxious stimulants by several mechanisms but until now the effect of gastric acid on H2S production has not been evaluated. This study was performed to determine the effect of basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion on mRNA and protein expression of cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), and on mucosal release of H2S in rats. Seventy-two male rats were randomly assigned into 9 groups (8 in each)-control, distention, and pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion groups. The effects of 15% alcohol solution, propargylglycine (PAG), L-NAME, and pantoprazole were also investigated. Under anesthesia, animals underwent tracheostomy and midline laparotomy. A catheter was inserted into the stomach through the duodenum for gastric washout. At the end of the experiments, the animals were killed and the gastric mucosa was collected to measure H2S concentration and to quantify mRNA expression of CSE and CBS by quantitative real-time PCR, and expression of their proteins by western blot. Basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion increased mucosal levels of H2S, and mRNA and protein expression of CSE. Pantoprazole and L-NAME reversed H2S release and restored protein expression of CSE to the control level. Pantoprazole, but not propargylglycine, pretreatment inhibited the elevated level of protein expression of eNOS in response to distention-induced gastric acid secretion. Our findings indicated that NO mediated the stimulatory effect of gastric acid on H2S release and protein expression of CSE.

Ophthalmic changes have occurred in a subset of astronauts on International Space Station missions. Visual deterioration is considered the greatest human health risk of spaceflight. Affected astronauts exhibit higher concentrations of 1-carbon metabolites (e.g., homocysteine) before flight. We hypothesized that genetic variations in 1-carbon metabolism genes contribute to susceptibility to ophthalmic changes in astronauts. We investigated 5 polymorphisms in the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) genes and their association with ophthalmic changes after flight in 49 astronauts. The number of G alleles of MTRR 66 and C alleles of SHMT1 1420 both contributed to the odds of visual disturbances. Preflight dehydroepiandrosterone was positively associated with cotton wool spots, and serum testosterone response during flight was associated with refractive change. Block regression showed that B-vitamin status and genetics were significant predictors of many of the ophthalmic outcomes that we observed. In one example, genetics trended toward improving (P = 0.10) and B-vitamin status significantly improved (P &lt; 0.001) the predictive model for refractive change after flight. We document an association between MTRR 66 and SHMT1 1420 polymorphisms and spaceflight-induced vision changes. This line of research could lead to therapeutic options for both space travelers and terrestrial patients.

The cancer epigenome exhibits global loss of DNA methylation, which contributes to genomic instability and aberrant gene expression by mechanisms that are yet to be fully elucidated. We previously discovered over 3300 long non-coding (lnc)RNAs in human cells and demonstrated that specific lncRNAs regulate gene expression via interactions with chromatin-modifying complexes. Here, we tested whether lncRNAs could also associate with DNA methyltransferases to regulate DNA methylation and gene expression. Using RIP-seq, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that interact with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in a colon cancer cell line, HCT116. One lncRNA, TCONS_00023265, which we named DACOR1 (DNMT1-associated Colon Cancer Repressed lncRNA 1), shows high, tissue-specific expression in the normal colon (including colon crypts) but was repressed in a panel of colon tumors and patient-derived colon cancer cell lines. We identified the genomic occupancy sites of DACOR1, which we found to significantly overlap with known differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in colon tumors. Induction of DACOR1 in colon cancer cell lines significantly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro, suggesting a growth suppressor function. Consistent with the observed phenotype, induction of DACOR1 led to the activation of tumor-suppressor pathways and attenuation of cancer-associated metabolic pathways. Notably, DACOR1 induction resulted in down-regulation of Cystathionine ß-synthase, which is known to lead to increased levels of S-adenosyl methionine-the key methyl donor for DNA methylation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that deregulation of DNMT1-associated lncRNAs contributes to aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression during colon tumorigenesis.

While N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), an electrophilic metabolite of acetaminophen (APAP), has been found to undergo GSH conjugation associated with its detoxification, interaction of NAPQI with nucleophilic per- and polysulfides produced by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase, and/or other enzymes is not known. In the present study, we found that sulfur adducts such as the NAPQIH2-SSSCys adduct and the NAPQIH2-SSG adduct are produced in biological samples of mice upon APAP exposure. Our in vitro experiments indicated that the formation of these novel APAP metabolites is, at least in part, attributable to the interaction of CysSSnSH produced by CSE and GSH persulfide with APAP-derived NAPQI.

BACKGROUND: This paper summarizes the results of a group effort to bring together the worldwide available data on patients who are either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for mutations in MAT1A. MAT1A encodes the subunit that forms two methionine adenosyltransferase isoenzymes, tetrameric MAT I and dimeric MAT III, that catalyze the conversion of methionine and ATP to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Subnormal MAT I/III activity leads to hypermethioninemia. Individuals, with hypermethioninemia due to one of the MAT1A mutations that in heterozygotes cause relatively mild and clinically benign hypermethioninemia are currently often being flagged in screening programs measuring methionine elevation to identify newborns with defective cystathionine ß-synthase activity. Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for MAT1A mutations are less frequent. Some but not all, such individuals have manifested demyelination or other CNS abnormalities.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The goals of the present effort have been to determine the frequency of such abnormalities, to find how best to predict whether they will occur, and to evaluate the outcomes of the variety of treatment regimens that have been used. Data have been gathered for 64 patients, of whom 32 have some evidence of CNS abnormalities (based mainly on MRI findings), and 32 do not have such evidence.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results show that mean plasma methionine concentrations provide the best indication of the group into which a given patient will fall: those with means of 800 µM or higher usually have evidence of CNS abnormalities, whereas those with lower means usually do not. Data are reported for individual patients for MAT1A genotypes, plasma methionine, total homocysteine (tHcy), and AdoMet concentrations, liver function studies, results of 15 pregnancies, and the outcomes of dietary methionine restriction and/or AdoMet supplementation. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms that might contribute to CNS damage are discussed, and tentative suggestions are put forth as to optimal management.

In addition to its role in the endogenous synthesis of cysteine, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) is a major physiological source of the vasorelaxant hydrogen sulfide. Cgl null mice are potentially useful for studying the influence of this compound upon vascular tone and endothelial function. Here, we confirm a previous report that female Cgl null mice exhibit an approximate 45-fold increase in plasma total homocysteine compared to wild type controls. This level of homocysteine is approximately 3.5-fold higher than that observed in male Cgl null mice and is essentially equivalent to that observed in mouse models of cystathionine beta synthase deficient homocystinuria. Cgl null mice of both sexes exhibited decreased expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase compared to WT controls. Female Cgl null mice exhibited a sex-specific induction of betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase and methionine adenosyltransferase 1, alpha and a 70% decrease in methionine synthase expression accompanied by significantly decreased plasma methionine. Decreased plasma cysteine levels in female Cgl null mice were associated with sex-specific dysregulation of cysteine dioxygenase expression. Comparative histological assessment between cystathionine beta-synthase and Cgl null mice indicated that the therapeutic potential of cystathionine against liver injury merits possible further investigation. Collectively, our data demonstrates the importance of considering sex when investigating mouse models of inborn errors of metabolism and indicate that while female Cgl null mice are of questionable utility for studying the physiological role of hydrogen sulfide, they could serve as a useful model for studying the consequences of methionine synthase deficiency and the methylfolate trap.

BACKGROUND: Many invading oral bacteria are known to produce considerable amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The toxic activity of exogenous H2S in periodontal tissue has been demonstrated, but the role of endogenous H2S in the physiologic function of periodontal tissue remains poorly understood. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the biologic functions of H2S in the proliferation and differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs).METHODS: PDLSCs were isolated from periodontal ligament tissues of periodontally healthy volunteers or patients with periodontitis. Immunocytochemical staining, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis were used to examine the expression of H2S-synthesizing enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). The proliferation capacity of PDLSCs was determined by cell counting kit-8 assay, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester analysis, and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay. The osteogenic potential of PDLSCs was tested using alkaline phosphatase staining, Alizarin Red staining, and in vivo transplantation experiments. Oil Red O staining was used to analyze adipogenic ability.RESULTS: The results show that human PDLSCs express both CBS and CSE and produce H2S. Blocking the generation of endogenous H2S with CBS inhibitor hydroxylamine significantly attenuated PDLSC proliferation and reduced the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity of PDLSCs. In contrast, CSE inhibitor DL-propargylglycine had no effect on PDLSC function. Exogenous H2S could inhibit the production of endogenous H2S and impair PDLSC function in a dose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Physiologic levels of endogenous H2S maintain the proliferation and differentiation capacity of PDLSCs, and CBS may be the main source of endogenous H2S in PDLSCs.

Neuroendocrine-differentiated prostate cancer cells may contribute to androgen-independent proliferation of surrounding cells through Ca(2+)-dependent secretion of mitogenic factors. Human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, when neuroendocrine-differentiated, overexpress Cav3.2 T-type Ca(2+) channels that contribute to Ca(2+)-dependent secretion. Given evidence for the acceleration of Cav3.2 activity by hydrogen sulfide (H2S), we examined the roles of the H2S/Cav3.2 pathway and then analyzed the molecular mechanisms of the Cav3.2 overexpression in neuroendocrine-differentiated LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were differentiated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Protein levels and T-type Ca(2+) channel-dependent currents (T-currents) were measured by immunoblotting and whole-cell pacth-clamp technique, respectively. Spontaneous release of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was monitored to evaluate secretory function. The differentiated LNCaP cells exhibited neurite outgrowth, androgen-independent proliferation and upregulation of mitogenic factors, and also showed elevation of Cav3.2 expression or T-currents. Expression of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), H2S-forming enzymes, and spontaneous secretion of PAP increased following the differentiation. The augmented T-currents were enhanced by H2S donors and suppressed by inhibitors of CSE, but not CBS. The PAP secretion was reduced by inhibition of CSE or T-type Ca(2+) channels. During differentiation, Egr-1 and REST, positive and negative transcriptional regulators for Cav3.2, were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, and Egr-1 knockdown prevented the Cav3.2 overexpression. Our data suggest that, in neuroendocrine-differentiated LNCaP cells, H2S formed by the upregulated CSE promotes the activity of the upregulated Cav3.2, leading to the elevated secretory functions. The overexpression of Cav3.2 appears to involve upregulation of Egr-1 and downregulation of REST.

We previously reported that Wistar Kyoto rats, an animal model of depression, have a characteristically abnormal serine metabolism in the brain, i.e., lower serine and cystathionine, which is a metabolite of serine, concentrations in the brain. To explore the mechanism underlying this abnormality, the expression of cystathionine ß-synthase and serine racemase, which are the enzymes involved in the serine metabolism, was investigated in the cerebellum and hippocampus of Wistar and Wistar Kyoto rats. Wistar Kyoto rats exhibited a significantly lower mRNA expression of cystathionine ß-synthase in the cerebellum in comparison with Wistar rats, while expression levels in the hippocampus did not differ between strains. Previous study indicated that the reduction of cystathionine ß-synthase in the brain induced cerebellar aplasia in mice. Therefore, the cerebellar size was compared between Wistar rats and Wistar Kyoto rats. Wistar Kyoto rats displayed a lower ratio of cerebellum weight to whole-brain weight compared with Wistar rats of the same generation or similar body weight, suggesting that Wistar Kyoto rats exhibit smaller cerebellum. These results suggest that the lower mRNA expression of cystathionine ß-synthase in the cerebellum and the smaller size of cerebellum may be related to the depression-like behavior in Wistar Kyoto rats.

The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is emerging as a mediator of lung physiology and disease. Recent studies revealed that H2S administration limited perturbations to lung structure in experimental animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), partially restoring alveolarization, limiting pulmonary hypertension, limiting inflammation, and promoting epithelial repair. No studies have addressed roles for endogenous H2S in lung development. H2S is endogenously generated by cystathionine ß-synthase (Cbs) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (Cth). We demonstrate here that the expression of Cbs and Cth in mouse lungs is dynamically regulated during lung alveolarization and that alveolarization is blunted in Cbs(-/-) and Cth(-/-) mouse pups, where a 50% reduction in the total number of alveoli was observed, without any impact on septal thickness. Laser-capture microdissection and immunofluorescence staining indicated that Cbs and Cth were expressed in the airway epithelium and lung vessels. Loss of Cbs and Cth led to a 100-500% increase in the muscularization of small- and medium-sized lung vessels, which was accompanied by increased vessel wall thickness, and an apparent decrease in lung vascular supply. Ablation of Cbs expression using small interfering RNA or pharmacological inhibition of Cth using propargylglycine in lung endothelial cells limited angiogenic capacity, causing a 30-40% decrease in tube length and a 50% decrease in number of tubes formed. In contrast, exogenous administration of H2S with GYY4137 promoted endothelial tube formation. These data confirm a key role for the H2S-generating enzymes Cbs and Cth in pulmonary vascular development and homeostasis and in lung alveolarization. 



#### Betaine supplementation is less effective than methionine restriction in correcting phenotypes of CBS deficient mice.

Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by elevated serum total homocysteine (tHcy). Betaine supplementation, which can lower tHcy by stimulating homocysteine remethylation to methionine, is often given to CBS deficient patients in combination with other treatments such as methionine restriction and supplemental B-vitamins. However, the effectiveness of betaine supplementation by itself in the treatment of CBS deficiency has not been well explored. Here, we have examined the effect of a betaine supplemented diet on the Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) mouse model of CBS deficiency and compared its effectiveness to our previously published data using a methionine restricted diet. Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) mice on betaine, from the time of weaning until for 240 days of age, had a 40 % decrease in mean tHcy level and a 137 % increase in serum methionine levels. Betaine-treated Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) mice also exhibited increased levels of betaine-dependent homocysteine methyl transferase (BHMT), increased levels of the lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD-1), and increased lipid droplet accumulation in the liver. Betaine supplementation largely reversed the hair loss phenotype in Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) animals, but was far less effective than methionine restriction in reversing the weight-loss, fat-loss, and osteoporosis phenotypes. Surprisingly, betaine supplementation had several negative effects in control Tg-I278T Cbs (+/-) mice including decreased weight gain, lean mass, and bone mineral density. Our findings indicate that while betaine supplementation does have some beneficial effects, it is not as effective as methionine restriction for reversing the phenotypes associated with severe CBS deficiency in mice.

AIM: To investigate the roles of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B on cystathionine ß synthetase (CBS) expression and visceral hypersensitivity in rats.METHODS: This study used 1-7-wk-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Western blot analysis was employed to measure the expression of TLR4, NF-<U+03BA>B and the endogenous hydrogen sulfide-producing enzyme CBS in colon dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from control and &quot;irritable bowel syndrome&quot; rats induced by neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI). Colon-specific DRG neurons were labeled with Dil and acutely dissociated to measure excitability with patch-clamp techniques. Immunofluorescence was employed to determine the co-expression of TLR4, NF-<U+03BA>B and CBS in DiI-labeled DRG neurons.RESULTS: NCI significantly upregulated the expression of TLR4 in colon-related DRGs (0.34 ± 0.12 vs 0.72 ± 0.02 for the control and NCI groups, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). Intrathecal administration of the TLR4-selective inhibitor CLI-095 significantly enhanced the colorectal distention threshold of NCI rats. CLI-095 treatment also markedly reversed the hyperexcitability of colon-specific DRG neurons and reduced the expression of CBS (1.7 ± 0.1 vs 1.1 ± 0.04, P &lt; 0.05) and of the NF-<U+03BA>B subunit p65 (0.8 ± 0.1 vs 0.5 ± 0.1, P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the NF-<U+03BA>B-selective inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) significantly reduced the upregulation of CBS (1.0 ± 0.1 vs 0.6 ± 0.1, P &lt; 0.05) and attenuated visceral hypersensitivity in the NCI rats. In vitro, incubation of cultured DRG neurons with the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide significantly enhanced the expression of p65 (control vs 8 h: 0.9 ± 0.1 vs 1.3 ± 0.1; control vs 12 h: 0.9 ± 0.1 vs 1.3 ± 0.1, P &lt; 0.05; control vs 24 h: 0.9 ± 0.1 vs 1.6 ± 0.1, P &lt; 0.01) and CBS (control vs 12 h: 1.0 ± 0.1 vs 2.2 ± 0.4; control vs 24 h: 1.0 ± 0.1 vs 2.6 ± 0.1, P &lt; 0.05), whereas the inhibition of p65 via pre-incubation with PDTC significantly reversed the upregulation of CBS expression (1.2 ± 0.1 vs 0.6 ± 0.0, P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the activation of TLR4 by NCI upregulates CBS expression, which is mediated by the NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway, thus contributing to visceral hypersensitivity.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Emerging studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the development and progression of fibrosis in CKD. HHcy and its intermediates are known to alter the DNA methylation pattern, which is a critical regulator of epigenetic information. In this study, we hypothesized that HHcy causes renovascular remodeling by DNA hypermethylation, leading to glomerulosclerosis. We also evaluated whether the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) could modulate extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism and reduce renovascular fibrosis. C57BL/6J (wild-type) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS(+/-)) mice, treated without or with 5-Aza (0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), were used. CBS(+/-) mice showed high plasma Hcy levels, hypertension, and significant glomerular and arteriolar injury. 5-Aza treatment normalized blood pressure and reversed renal injury. CBS(+/-) mice showed global hypermethylation and up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase-1 and -3a. Methylation-specific PCR showed an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2 and also increased collagen and galectin-3 expression. 5-Aza reduced abnormal DNA methylation and restored the MMP-9/TIMP-1, -2 balance. In conclusion, our data suggest that during HHcy, abnormal DNA methylation and an imbalance between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and -2 lead to ECM remodeling and renal fibrosis.

Objective Homocystinuria is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism caused by cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency that affects methionine metabolism. The clinical features are heterogeneous ranging from mental retardation, ectopia lentis, and osteoporosis to vascular events such as deep vein thrombosis, sagital sinus thrombosis, and myocardial infarction. Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CVST) is an unusual disorder in children and requires prompt and accurate management. Some causal factors for the development of CVST differ between children and adults. The majority of cases with CSVT are found to have an underlying cause for thrombosis like dehydration, infections, prothrombotic and hematologic disorders, malignancy and trauma. Although homocystinuria is usually associated with ischemic strokes, CVST as initial clinical presentation of homocystinuria is rare in children. In this article, we presented a 10-year old boy with seizure, hemiparesis, and ataxia due to CSVT caused by homocystinuria.

Laminar shear flow triggers a signaling cascade that maintains the integrity of endothelial cells (ECs). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a new gasotransmitter is regarded as an upstream regulator of nitric oxide (NO). Whether the H2S-generating enzymes are correlated to the enzymes involved in NO production under shear flow conditions remains unclear as yet. In the present study, the cultured ECs were subjected to a constant shear flow (12 dyn/cm(2)) in a parallel flow chamber system. We investigated the expression of three key enzymes for H2S biosynthesis, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercapto-sulfurtransferase (3-MST). Shear flow markedly increased the level of 3-MST. Shear flow enhanced the production of H2S was determined by NBD-SCN reagent that can bind to cysteine/homocystein. Exogenous treatment of NaHS that can release gaseous H2S, ECs showed an increase of phosphorylation in Akt(S473), ERK(T202/Y204) and eNOS(S1177). This indicated that H2S can trigger the NO-production signaling cascade. Silencing of CSE, CBS and 3-MST genes by siRNA separately attenuated the phosphorylation levels of Akt(S473) and eNOS(S1177) under shear flow conditions. The particular mode of shear flow increased H2S production. The interplay between H2S and NO-generating enzymes were discussed in the present study.

Our previous study has demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) attenuates neuronal injury induced by vascular dementia (VD) in rats, but the mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the neuroprotection of H2S was associated with synaptic plasticity and try to interpret the potential underlying mechanisms. Adult male Wistar rats were suffered the ligation of bilateral common carotid arteries. At 24 h after surgery, rats were administered intraperitoneally with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, 5.6 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)), a H2S donor, for 3 weeks in the VD+NaHS group and treated intraperitoneally with saline in the VD group respectively. Our results demonstrated that NaHS significantly decreased the level of glutamate. It obviously ameliorated cognitive flexibility as well as the spatial learning and memory abilities by Morris water maze. Moreover, NaHS significantly improved the long-term depression (LTD), and was able to elevate the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A, which plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, NaHS decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, and it could maintain the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK-3ß). Surprisingly, NaHS triggered the canonical Notch pathway by increasing expressions of Jagged-1 and Hes-1. These findings suggest that NaHS prevents synaptic plasticity from VD-induced damage partly via Akt/GSK-3ß pathway and Notch signaling pathway.Hydrogen sulfide modulated the ratio of NMDAR 2A/2B and improved the synaptic plasticity via Akt/GSK-3ß pathway and Notch signaling pathway in VD rats.

Cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient (Cbs (-/-)) mice, an animal model for homocystinuria, exhibit hepatic steatosis and juvenile semilethality via as yet unknown mechanisms. The plasma protein profile of Cbs (-/-) mice was investigated by proteomic analysis using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry. We found hyperaccumulation of a-fetoprotein (AFP) and downregulation of most other plasma proteins. AFP was highly expressed in fetal liver, but its expression declined dramatically via transcriptional repression after birth in both wild-type and Cbs (-/-) mice. However, the repression was delayed in Cbs (-/-) mice, causing high postnatal AFP levels, which may relate to transcriptional repression of most plasma proteins originating from liver and the observed hepatic dysfunction.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domain containing proteins (CDCPs) constitute a big family in plants and some members in this family have been implicated in a variety of biological processes, but the precise functions and the underlying mechanism of the majority of this family in plant immunity remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a CBS domain containing protein gene, OsCBSX3, is functionally characterized in rice resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). By quantitative real-time PCR, transcripts of OsCBSX3 are up-regulated significantly by inoculation of M. oryzae and the exogenously applied salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA). OsCBSX3 is exclusively localized to the plasma membrane by transient expression of OsCBSX3 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) through approach of Agrobacterium infiltration in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plants of homozygous T3 transgenic rice lines of over-expressing OsCBSX3 exhibit significant enhanced resistance to M. oryzae inoculation, manifested by decreased disease symptoms, and inhibition of pathogen growth detected in DNA. Consistently, the over-expression of OsCBSX3 enhances the transcript levels of immunity associated marker genes including PR1a, PR1b, PR5, AOS2, PAL, NH1, and OsWRKY13 in plants inoculated with M. oryzae. These results suggest that OsCBSX3 acts as a positive regulator in resistance of rice to M. oryzae regulated by SA and JA-mediated signaling pathways synergistically.

Betaine is the substrate of the liver- and kidney-specific betaine-homocysteine (Hcy) methyltransferase (BHMT), an alternate pathway for Hcy remethylation. We hypothesized that BHMT is a major pathway for homocysteine removal in cases of hyperhomocysteinaemia (HHcy). Therefore, we measured betaine in plasma and tissues from patients and animal models of HHcy of genetic and acquired cause. Plasma was collected from patients presenting HHcy without any Hcy interfering treatment. Plasma and tissues were collected from rat models of HHcy induced by diet and from a mouse model of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency. S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet), S-adenosyl-homocysteine (AdoHcy), methionine, betaine and dimethylglycine (DMG) were quantified by ESI-LC-MS/MS. mRNA expression was quantified using quantitative real-time (QRT)-PCR. For all patients with diverse causes of HHcy, plasma betaine concentrations were below the normal values of our laboratory. In the diet-induced HHcy rat model, betaine was decreased in all tissues analysed (liver, brain, heart). In the mouse CBS deficiency model, betaine was decreased in plasma, liver, heart and brain, but was conserved in kidney. Surprisingly, BHMT expression and activity was decreased in liver. However, in kidney, BHMT and SLC6A12 expression was increased in CBS-deficient mice. Chronic HHcy, irrespective of its cause, induces betaine depletion in plasma and tissues (liver, brain and heart), indicating a global decrease in the body betaine pool. In kidney, betaine concentrations were not affected, possibly due to overexpression of the betaine transporter SLC6A12 where betaine may be conserved because of its crucial role as an osmolyte.

Beta-amyloid (Aß), a neurotoxic peptide, accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects to initiate neuroinflammation eventually leading to memory impairment. Here, we demonstrated that Aß-injected rats exhibited cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation with a remarkable reduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels in the hippocampus compared with that in shamoperated rats. Interestingly, the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and 3- mercaptopyruvate-sulfurtransferase (3MST), the major enzymes responsible for endogenous H2S generation, were also significantly decreased. However, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a H2S donor) dramatically attenuated cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation induced by hippocampal injection of 10 µg of Aß1-42 in rats. Subsequently, NaHS significantly suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in rat hippocampus following Aß administration. Furthermore, NaHS exerted a beneficial effect on inhibition of I<U+03BA>B-a degradation and subsequent activation of transcription factor nuclear factor <U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B), as well as inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activity and p38 MAPK activity but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity induced by Aß. These results demonstrate that NaHS might be a potential agent for treatment of neuroinflammation-related AD.

Hydrogen sulfide is rapidly emerging as a key physiological mediator and potential therapeutic tool in numerous areas such as acute and chronic inflammation, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer. However, the vast majority of the published studies have employed crude sulfide salts such as sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) as H2S &quot;donors&quot; to generate H2S. Although these salts are cheap, readily available and easy to use, H2S generated from them occurs as an instantaneous and pH-dependent dissociation, whereas endogenous H2S synthesis from the enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine-ß-synthase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase is a slow and sustained process. Furthermore, sulfide salts are frequently used at concentrations (e.g. 100 µM to 10 mM) far in excess of the levels of H2S reported in vivo (nM to low µM). For the therapeutic potential of H2S is to be properly harnessed, pharmacological agents which generate H2S in a physiological manner and deliver physiologically relevant concentrations are needed. The phosphorodithioate GYY4137 has been proposed as &quot;slow-release&quot; H2S donors and has shown promising efficacy in cellular and animal model diseases such as hypertension, sepsis, atherosclerosis, neonatal lung injury and cancer. However, H2S generation from GYY4137 is inefficient necessitating its use at high concentrations/doses. However, structural modification of the phosphorodithioate core has led to compounds (e.g. AP67 and AP105) with accelerated rates of H2S generation and enhanced biological activity. In this review, the therapeutic potential and limitations of GYY4137 and related phosphorodithioate derivatives are discussed.

Recent studies revealed increased expression of various hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzymes in cancer cells of various tissue types, and new roles of H2S in the pathophysiology of cancer have emerged. This is particularly evident in cancers of the colon and ovaries, where the malignant cells both overexpress cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and produce increased amounts of H2S, which enhances tumor growth and spread by (a) stimulating cellular bioenergetics, (b) activating proliferative, migratory, and invasive signaling pathways, and (c) enhancing tumor angiogenesis. Importantly, in preclinical models of these cancers, either pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of CBS was shown to be sufficient to suppress cancer cell bioenergetics in vitro, inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, and enhance the antitumor efficacy of frontline chemotherapeutic agents, providing a strong rationale for the development of CBS-targeted inhibitors as anticancer therapies. However, the observation that inhibition of H2S biosynthesis exerts anticancer effects is contradicted by other studies showing that increasing H2S with exogenous donors also exerts antitumor actions. Herein, we present a brief review of the scientific literature documenting the function of H2S, H2S donors, and transsulfuration enzymes in cancers from various tissue types, and propose that the paradoxical actions of H2S can be resolved by considering the bell-shaped pharmacology of H2S, whereby lower (endogenous) H2S production tends to promote, while higher (generated from exogenously added H2S donors) tends to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Finally, we suggest areas for future investigations to expand our knowledge of this nascent field.

In this chapter the role played by H2S in the physiopathology of urogenital tract revising animal and human data available in the current relevant literature is discussed. H2S pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the mechanism underlying penile erection in human and experimental animal. Both cystathionine-ß synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3> lyase (CSE) are expressed in the human corpus cavernosum and exogenous H2S relaxes isolated human corpus cavernosum strips in an endothelium-independent manner. Hydrogen sulfide pathway also accounts for the direct vasodilatory effect operated by testosterone on isolated vessels. Convincing evidence suggests that H2S can influence the cGMP pathway by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) activity. All these findings taken together suggest an important role for the H2S pathway in human corpus cavernosum homeostasis. However, H2S effect is not confined to human corpus cavernosum but also plays an important role in human bladder. Human bladder expresses mainly CBS and generates in vitro detectable amount of H2S. In addition the bladder relaxant effect of the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil involves H2S as mediator. In conclusion the H2S pathway is not only involved in penile erection but also plays a role in bladder homeostasis. In addition the finding that it involved in the mechanism of action of PDE-5 inhibitors strongly suggests that modulation of this pathway can represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and bladder diseases.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as a signaling molecule as well as a cytoprotective molecule. H2S modulates neurotransmission, regulates vascular tone, protects various tissues and organs, regulates inflammation, induces angiogenesis, and detects cellular oxygen levels. H2S is produced from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) together with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). Recently, a novel pathway for the production of H2S from D-cysteine was identified, involving D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) together with 3MST. Sulfuration (also called sulfhydration), which adds sulfur atoms to the cysteine residues of target proteins to modify protein activity, has been extensively studied as a mode of H2S action. Recently, hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn, where n=3-7; n=2 is termed as persulfide) have been found to sulfurate target proteins in the brain, including transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), much more potently than H2S. The physiological stimuli that trigger the production of H2S and polysulfides, and the mechanisms maintaining their local levels, remain unknown. Understanding the regulation of H2Sn (including H2S) production, and the specific stimuli that induce their release, will provide new insight into the biology of H2S and will provide novel avenues for therapeutic development in diseases involving H2S-related substances.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a biologically active gas that is synthesized naturally by three enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). These enzymes are constitutively present in a wide array of biological cells and tissues and their expression can be induced by a number of disease states. It is becoming increasingly clear that H2S is an important mediator of a wide range of cell functions in health and in disease. This review therefore provides an overview of the biochemical and molecular regulation of H2S synthesizing enzymes both in physiological conditions and their modulation in disease states with particular focus on their regulation in asthma, atherosclerosis and diabetes. The importance of small molecule inhibitors in the study of molecular pathways, the current use of common H2S synthesizing enzyme inhibitors and the relevant characteristics of mice in which these enzymes have been genetically deleted will also be summarized. With a greater understanding of the molecular regulation of these enzymes in disease states, as well as the availability of novel small molecules with high specificity targeted towards H2S producing enzymes, the potential to regulate the biological functions of this intriguing gas H2S for therapeutic effect can perhaps be brought one step closer.

BACKGROUND: Progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with inadequate recovery of damaged kidney. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) regulates a variety of cellular signals involved in cell death, differentiation and proliferation. This study aimed to identify the role of H2S and its producing enzymes in the recovery of kidney following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.METHODS: Mice were subjected to 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia. Some mice were administered daily NaHS, an H2S donor, and propargylglycine (PAG), an inhibitor of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), during the recovery phase. Cell proliferation was assessed via 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay.RESULTS: Ischemia resulted in decreases in CSE and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) expression and activity, and H2S level in the kidney. These decreases did not return to sham level until 8 days after ischemia when kidney had fibrotic lesions. NaHS administration to I/R-injured mice accelerated the recovery of renal function and tubule morphology, whereas PAG delayed that. Furthermore, PAG increased mortality after ischemia. NaHS administration to I/R-injured mice accelerated tubular cell proliferation, whereas it inhibited interstitial cell proliferation. In addition, NaHS treatment reduced post-I/R superoxide formation, lipid peroxidation, level of GSSG/GSH and Nox4 expression, whereas it increased catalase and MnSOD expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that H2S accelerates the recovery of I/R-induced kidney damage, suggesting that the H2S-producing transsulfuration pathway plays an important role in kidney repair after acute injury.

Increasing studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the potential application value of H2S in the therapy of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is still not well known. This study was to investigate the potential effect of H2S on early brain injury (EBI) induced by SAH and explore the underlying mechanisms. The role of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor of H2S, in SAH-induced EBI, was investigated in both in vivo and in vitro. A prechiasmatic cistern single injection model was used to produce experimental SAH in vivo. In vitro, cultured primary rat cortical neurons and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to OxyHb at concentration of 10 µM to mimic SAH. Endogenous production of H2S in the brain was significantly inhibited by SAH. The protein levels of the predominant H2S-generating enzymes in the brain, including cystathionineb-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST), were also correspondingly reduced by SAH, while treatment with NaHS restored H2S production and the expressions of CBS and 3MST. More importantly, NaHS treatment could significantly attenuate EBI (including brain edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, brain cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, and cerebral vasospasm) after SAH. In vitro, H2S protects neurons and endothelial function by functioning as an antioxidant and antiapoptotic mediator. Our results suggest that NaSH as an exogenous H2S donor could significantly reduce EBI induced by SAH.

BACKGROUND: Investigations of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) genes and gene-nutrient interactions with respect to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk are limited to candidate polymorphisms and dietary folate. This study comprehensively investigated associations between genetic variants in FOCM and CRC risk and whether the FOCM nutrient status modified these associations.METHODS: Two hundred eighty-eight candidate and tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 30 FOCM genes were genotyped for 821 incident CRC case-control matched pairs in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. FOCM biomarkers (red blood cell [RBC] folate, plasma folate, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate [PLP], vitamin B12, and homocysteine) and self-reported alcohol consumption were measured at the baseline. Conditional logistic regression was implemented; effect modification was examined on the basis of known enzyme-nutrient relations.RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were observed between CRC risk and functionally defined candidate SNPs of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1; K134R), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR; P450R), and PR domain containing 2 with ZNF domain (PRDM2; S450N) and a literature candidate SNP of thymidylate synthase (TYMS; g.676789A&gt;T; nominal P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05). In addition, suggestive associations were noted for tagging SNPs in cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3ß (DNMT3B), methionine adenosyltransferase I a (MAT1A), MTHFD1, and MTRR (nominal P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>.05; adjusted P, not significant). Significant interactions between nutrient biomarkers and candidate polymorphisms were observed for 1) plasma/RBC folate and folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1), paraoxonase 1 (PON1), transcobalamin II (TCN2), DNMT1, and DNMT3B; 2) plasma PLP and TYMS TS3; 3) plasma B12 and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2); and 4) homocysteine and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and alanyl-transfer RNA synthetase (AARS).CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in FOCM genes are associated with CRC risk among postmenopausal women. FOCM nutrients continue to emerge as effect modifiers of genetic influences on CRC risk.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the synthesis of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) was altered in achalasia patients and to determine the effects of H2 S on esophageal motility.METHODS: (1) Tissue samples in lower esophageal sphincter (LES) were obtained from 22 achalasia patients during peroral endoscopic myotomy. LES muscle from eight esophageal carcinoma patients was obtained as control. The expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) was detected by immunohistochemical staining. (2) Rabbit esophageal smooth muscle strips were used to measure isometric contractions. The effects of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and L-cysteine on contractile activity and bethanechol-stimulated contractile activity were evaluated. The contraction of esophageal muscle strips was also measured after the inhibition of CBS and CSE by aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) and propargylglycine (PAG).KEY RESULTS: Both CBS and CSE could be detected in biopsies from achalasia patients and controls. Compared with controls, the expression of CBS and CSE in the LES of achalasia patients was significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.001). Both NaHS and L-cysteine concentration-dependently inhibited esophageal contractile activity (both p &lt; 0.05). After inhibition of CBS and CSE by PAG and AOA, esophageal contractile activity increased significantly, and this effect could be restored by NaHS but not L-cysteine (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: H2 S synthesis enzymes are significantly reduced in patients with achalasia compared with the controls. H2 S inhibits esophageal contractile activity concentration-dependently, and the inhibition of H2 S synthesis enzymes increases esophageal contractile activity. H2 S might be involved in the development of achalasia.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure and oxidative stress. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that H2S exerts its cardiovascular effects by reducing oxidative stress via inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). We examined cell distributions of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and effects of H2S on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). We found that CBS was expressed in neurons of the RVLM, and the expression was lower in SHRs than in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Microinjection of NaHS (H2S donor), S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM, a CBS agonist), or Apocynin (NADPH oxidase inhibitor) into the RVLM reduced the ROS level, NADPH oxidase activity, and MAP, whereas microinjection of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HA, a CBS inhibitor) increased MAP. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of NaHS inhibited phosphorylation of p47(phox), a key step of NADPH oxidase activation. Since decreasing ROS level in the RVLM reduces MAP and heart rate and increasing H2S reduces ROS production, we conclude that H2S exerts an antihypertensive effect via suppressing ROS production. H2S, as an antioxidant, may be a potential target for cardiovascular diseases.

Based on the discovery of endogenous H2S production, many in depth studies show this gasotransmitter with a variety of physiological and pathological functions. Three enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST), are involved in enzymatic production of H2S. Emerging evidence has elucidated an important protective role of H2S in hypoxic conditions in many mammalian systems. However, the mechanisms by which H2S senses and responses to hypoxia are largely elusive. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) function as key regulators of oxygen sensing, activating target genes expression under hypoxia. Recent studies have shown that exogenous H2S regulates HIF action in different patterns. The activation of carotid bodies is a sensitive and prompt response to hypoxia, rapidly enhancing general O2 supply. H2S has been identified as an excitatory mediator of hypoxic sensing in the carotid bodies. This paper presents a brief review of the roles of these two pathways which contribute to hypoxic sensing of H2S.

Aims. To examine whether hydrogen sulfide (H2S) generation changed in ageing diabetic mouse hearts. Results. Compared to mice that were fed tap water only, mice that were fed 30% fructose solution for 15 months exhibited typical characteristics of a severe diabetic phenotype with cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction. H2S levels in plasma, heart tissues, and urine were significantly reduced in these mice as compared to those in controls. The expression of the H2S-generating enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, was significantly decreased in the hearts of fructose-fed mice, whereas cystathionine-ß-synthase levels were significantly increased. Conclusion. Our results suggest that this ageing diabetic mouse model developed diabetic cardiomyopathy and that H2S levels were reduced in the diabetic heart due to alterations in three H2S-producing enzymes, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can be synthesized in mammalian cells by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and/or cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Both CSE and CBS are expressed in rat gastric tissues but their role in human gastric neoplasia has been unclear. The aims of the present study were to detect CSE and CBS proteins in human gastric cancer and determine the effect of exogenous NaHS on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. We found that both CSE and CBS proteins were expressed in human gastric cancer cells and upregulated in human gastric carcinoma mucosa compared with those in noncancerous gastric samples. NaHS induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by regulating apoptosis related proteins. Also, NaHS inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. An antigastric cancer role of H2S is thus indicated.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced endogenously by the activation of two major H2S-generating enzymes (cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase), plays important regulatory roles in different physiologic and pathologic conditions. The abnormal metabolism of H2S is associated with fibrosis pathogenesis, causing damage in structure and function of different organs. A number of in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that both endogenous H2S level and the expressions of H2S-generating enzymes in plasma and tissues are significantly downregulated during fibrosis. Supplement with exogenous H2S mitigates the severity of fibrosis in various experimental animal models. The protective role of H2S in the development of fibrosis is primarily attributed to its antioxidation, antiapoptosis, anti-inflammation, proangiogenesis, and inhibition of fibroblasts activities. Future studies might focus on the potential to intervene fibrosis by targeting the pathway of endogenous H2S-producing enzymes and H2S itself.

In the family of gas transmitters, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is yet not adequately researched. Known for its rotten egg smell and adverse effects on the brain, lungs, and kidneys for more than 300 years, the vasorelaxant effects of H2S on blood vessel was first observed in 1997. Since then, research continued to explore the possible therapeutic effects of H2S in hypertension, inflammation, pancreatitis, different types of shock, diabetes, and heart failure. However, a considerable amount of efforts are yet needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of H2S, such as nitric oxide-dependent or independent vasodilation in hypertension and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than a decade of good repute among researchers, H2S research has certain results that need to be clarified or reevaluated. H2S produces its response by multiple modes of action, such as opening the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and calcium channel blockade. H2S is endogenously produced from two sulfur-containing amino acids L-cysteine and L-methionine by the two enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase and cystathionine ß synthase. Recently, the third enzyme, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase, along with cysteine aminotransferase, which is similar to aspartate aminotransferase, has been found to produce H2S in the brain. The H2S has interested researchers, and a great deal of information is being generated every year. This review aims to provide an update on the developments in the research of H2S in hypertension amid the ambiguity in defining the exact role of H2S in hypertension because of insufficient number of research results on this area. This critical review on the role of H2S in hypertension will clarify the gray areas and highlight its future prospects.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is an enzyme in the transulfuration pathway that can catalyze the condensation of homocysteine (Hcy) and cysteine (Cys) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and cystathionine (CTH). CBS-derived H2S is important in angiogenesis and drug resistance in colon and ovarian cancers, respectively. However, the mechanisms by which cancer cell-derived H2S is utilized by cancer cells as a protective agent against host-derived activated macrophages are not yet investigated. This study investigated the mechanistic role of CBS-derived H2S in the protection of human breast cancer (HBC) cells against activated macrophages. HBC patient-derived tissue arrays and immunoblot analysis of HBC cells exhibited significantly increased levels of CBS when compared with their normal counterparts. This was associated with increased levels of H2S and CTH. Silencing of CBS in HBC cells caused a significant decrease in the levels of H2S and CTH but did not affect the growth of these cells per se, in in vitro cultures. However CBS-silenced cells exhibited significantly reduced growth in the presence of activated macrophages and in xenograft models. This was associated with an increase in the steady state levels of reactive aldehyde-derived protein adducts. Exogenous addition of H2S countered the effects of CBS silencing in the presence of macrophages. Conversely overexpression of CBS in human breast epithelial (HBE) cells (which do not naturally express CBS) protected them from activated macrophages, which were otherwise susceptible to the latter.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, Hcy-lowering strategies were found to have limited effects in reducing cardiovascular events. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Increasing evidence reveals a role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of HHcy. Homocysteine (Hcy) is a precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is formed via the transsulfuration pathway catalyzed by cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and serves as a novel modulator of inflammation. In the present study, we showed that methionine supplementation induced mild HHcy in mice, associated with the elevations of TNF-a and IL-1ß in the plasma and reductions of plasma H2S level and CSE expression in the peritoneal macrophages. H2S-releasing compound GYY4137 attenuated the increases of TNF-a and IL-1ß in the plasma of HHcy mice and Hcy-treated raw264.7 cells while CSE inhibitor PAG exacerbated it. Moreover, the in vitro study showed that Hcy inhibited CSE expression and H2S production in macrophages, accompanied by the increases of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression and DNA hypermethylation in cse promoter region. DNMT inhibition or knockdown reversed the decrease of CSE transcription induced by Hcy in macrophages. In sum, our findings demonstrate that Hcy may trigger inflammation through inhibiting CSE-H2S signaling, associated with increased promoter DNA methylation and transcriptional repression of cse in macrophages.

Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is a serine-threonine kinase that mediates the cardioprotective effect of ischemic and pharmacologic preconditioning. Since hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been implicated in mediating the cardioprotective effects of the cGMP modulators tadalafil and cinaciguat, we tested the hypothesis that myocardial gene therapy with PKG exerts cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury through a mechanism involving H2S. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were infected with adenoviral vector encoding PKGIa or inactive mutant PKGIaK390A (K390A) for 24 h. Necrosis and apoptosis (n = 6/group) were determined after 90 min of simulated ischemia and 1 or 18 h of reoxygenation, respectively. To study the effect of PKGIa in vivo, mice received intramyocardial injections of adenoviral PKGIa or K390A. Four days later, the hearts were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion for 24 h. The inhibitor of H2S-producing enzyme, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), dl-propargylglycine (PAG, 50 mg/kg, ip) was given 30 min before ischemia. PKGIa overexpression induced CSE expression, whereas cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase expression was not changed. PKGIa overexpression increased H2S in the heart and cardiomyocytes in relation to control and PKGIaK390A. Moreover, PAG abolished protection with PKGIa in vitro by increasing necrosis (35.2 ± 1.7%, P &lt; 0.05) and apoptosis (23.5 ± 1.8 %, P &lt; 0.05) as compared to PKGIa-overexpressing cells (necrosis: 17.2 ± 0.9% and apoptosis: 13.2 ± 0.8%). In vivo, PKGIa overexpression reduced infarct size and preserved left ventricular fractional shortening as compared with K390A (P &lt; 0.05) and PAG abolished the cardioprotective effect of PKGIa. The protective effect of myocardial gene therapy with PKGIa against I/R injury is mediated through a mechanism involving H2S signaling.

PURPOSE: Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are among the most common birth defects in China. Environmental causes and folate metabolism changes may alter susceptibility to CHD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relevant risk-factors of children with CHD and their mothers.METHODS: 138 children with CHD and 207 normal children for controls were recruited. Their mothers were also enlisted in this study and interviewed following a questionnaire about their pregnant history and early pregnancy situation. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MS) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) of mothers and children were genotyped.RESULTS: There were significant differences in the gender of children, occupation of mothers, family history with CHD, history of abortion, history of adverse pregnancy, early pregnancy health, fetus during pregnancy, pesticide exposure and drug exposure in CHD group and control group ( P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analyses showed that after adjustment for above factors, MTHFR rs1801131 were significantly associated with their offspring CHD risk in mothers. Compared with the mothers whose MTHFR were rs1801131 AA and AC genotypes, the mothers who got a mutation of MTHFR rs1801131 CC genotypes had a 267% increase in risk of given birth of a CHD children (OR = 3.67,95%CI = 1.12-12.05). Meanwhile, MTHFR rs1801131 were significantly associated with CHD susceptibility in children (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.00-2.44 in additive model).CONCLUSIONS: Besides mothers' social and fertility characteristics, our results suggested that the genetic variants in folate metabolism pathway might be one of the most related risk-factors of CHD. MTHFR rs1801131 were identified as loci in Chinese population that were involved in CHD.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the expression levels of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) in a rat model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic fibrosis. A total of 56 Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: Normal control group, model group, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) group, and DL-propargylglycine (PAG) group. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by CCl4. The rats in the PAG group were intraperitoneally injected with PAG, an inhibitor of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). The rats in the NaHS group were intraperitoneally injected with NaHS. An equal volume of saline solution was intraperitoneally injected into both the control and model groups. All rats were sacrificed at week three or four following treatment. The serum levels of hyaluronidase (HA), laminin protein (LN), procollagen III (PcIII), and collagen IV (cIV) were detected using ELISA. The serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and albumin (ALB) were detected using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The liver mRNA expression levels of CSE were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The liver expression levels of AGTR1 and the plasma expression levels of H2S were detected using western blot analyses. The results indicated that the severity of hepatic fibrosis, the serum expression levels of HA, LN, PcIII, cIV, ALT, and AST, the liver expression levels of CSE and AGTR1, and the plasma expression levels of H2S were significantly higher in the PAG group, as compared with the model group (P&lt;0.05). Conversely, the expression levels of ALB were significantly lower in the PAG group, as compared with the model group. In addition, the severity of hepatic fibrosis, the serum expression levels of HA, LN, PcIII, cIV, ALT, and AST, the liver expression levels of CSE and AGTR1, and the plasma expression levels of H2S were significantly lower in the NaHS group, as compared with the model group (P&lt;0.05). These results suggest that endogenous H2S is associated with CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats, and may exhibit anti-fibrotic effects. Furthermore, H2S reduced the liver expression levels of AGTR1, which may be associated with the delayed progression of hepatic fibrosis.

Cysteine metabolism is considered essential for the crucial maintenance of a reducing environment in trypanosomatids due to its importance as a precursor of trypanothione biosynthesis. Expression, activity, functional rescue, and overexpression of cysteine synthase (CS) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS) were evaluated in Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes under in vitro stress conditions induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, or antimonial compounds. Our results demonstrate a stage-specific increase in the levels of protein expression and activity of L. braziliensis CS (LbrCS) and L. braziliensis CßS (LbrCßS), resulting in an increment of total thiol levels in response to both oxidative and nitrosative stress. The rescue of the CS activity in Trypanosoma rangeli, a trypanosome that does not perform cysteine biosynthesis de novo, resulted in increased rates of survival of epimastigotes expressing the LbrCS under stress conditions compared to those of wild-type parasites. We also found that the ability of L. braziliensis promastigotes and amastigotes overexpressing LbrCS and LbrCßS to resist oxidative stress was significantly enhanced compared to that of nontransfected cells, resulting in a phenotype far more resistant to treatment with the pentavalent form of Sb in vitro. In conclusion, the upregulation of protein expression and increment of the levels of LbrCS and LbrCßS activity alter parasite resistance to antimonials and may influence the efficacy of antimony treatment of New World leishmaniasis.

Placental soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) release is increased in preeclampsia, which might be associated with increased shedding of Flt-1 through a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Here, we explored whether ADAM10 expression is regulated by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in placenta. Pro- and active-ADAM10 expression were significantly increased in preeclamptic placentas and inversely correlated to H2S production enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase expression. H2S significantly suppressed pro- and active-ADAM10 expression whilst inhibited sFlt-1 release. Knockdown of ADAM10 caused a decrease in sFlt-1 release. Our data suggest that dysregulation of H2S production may contribute to excessive Flt-1shedding in preeclampsia.

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (Hcy) level is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). During transsulfuration pathways, Hcy is metabolized into hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is a synaptic modulator, as well as a neuro-protective agent. However, the role of hydrogen sulfide, as well as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and synaptic dysfunction, leading to AD pathology is not clear. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibition of neuronal NMDA-R by H2S and MK801 mitigate the Hcy-induced BBB disruption and synapse dysfunction, in part by decreasing neuronal matrix degradation. Hcy intracerebral (IC) treatment significantly impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral circulation and memory function. Hcy treatment also decreases the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the brain along with increased expression of NMDA-R (NR1) and synaptosomal Ca(2+) indicating excitotoxicity. Additionally, we found that Hcy treatment increased protein and mRNA expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 and also increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in the brain. The increased expression of ICAM-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and claudin-5 indicates BBB disruption and vascular inflammation. Moreover, we also found decreased expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP-97), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), synaptophysin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) showing synapse dysfunction in the hippocampus. Furthermore, NaHS and MK801 treatment ameliorates BBB disruption, CBF, and synapse functions in the mice brain. These results demonstrate a neuro-protective effect of H2S over Hcy-induced cerebrovascular pathology through the NMDA receptor. Our present study clearly signifies the therapeutic ramifications of H2S for cerebrovascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Graphical Abstract <U+115F>.

Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are known as biological messengers; they play an important role in human organism and contribute to many physiological and pathophysiological processes. NO is produced from l-arginine by constitutive NO synthase (NOS) and inducible NOS enzymatic pathways. This gaseous mediator inhibits platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and contributes to the vessel homeostasis. NO is known as a vasodilatory molecule involved in control of the gastric blood flow (GBF) and the maintenance of gastric mucosal barrier integrity in either healthy gastric mucosa or that damaged by strong irritants. Biosynthesis of H2S in mammals depends upon two enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. This gaseous mediator, similarly to NO and carbon monoxide, is involved in neuromodulation, vascular contractility and anti-inflammatory activities. For decades, H2S has been known to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase and reduce cell energy production. Nowadays it is generally considered to act through vascular smooth muscle ATP-dependent K+ channels, interacting with intracellular transcription factors and promote sulfhydration of protein cysteine moieties within the cell, but the mechanism of potential gastroprotective and ulcer healing properties of H2S has not been fully explained. The aim of this review is to compare current results of the studies concerning the role of H2S and NO in gastric mucosa protection and outline areas that may pose new opportunities for further development of novel therapeutic targets.

Chronic failure in maintenance and regeneration of skeletal muscles leads to lower muscle mass (sarcopenia), muscle weakness, and poor response to injury. Evidence suggests that aberrant p38 MAPK signaling undermines the repair process after injury in aged mice. Previous studies have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) has been associated with muscle weakness and lower than normal body weights. However, whether or not HHcy condition also compromises skeletal muscle regenerative capabilities is not clear. In the current study, we show that CBS-/+ mice, a model for HHcy condition, exhibited compromised regenerative function and cell proliferation upon injury. However, there was no significant difference in Pax7 expression levels in the satellite cells from CBS-/+ mouse skeletal muscles. Interestingly, the satellite cells from CBS-/+ mice not only exhibited diminished in vitro proliferative capabilities, but also there was heightened oxidative stress. In addition, there was enhanced p38 MAPK activation as well as p16 and p21 expression in the CBS-/+ mouse satellite cells. Moreover, the C2C12 myoblasts also exhibited higher p38 MAPK activation and p16 expression upon treatment with homocysteine in addition to enhanced ROS presence. Tissue engraftment potential and regeneration after injury were restored to some extent upon treatment with the p38-MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, in the CBS-/+ mice. These results together suggest that HHcy-induced diminished satellite cell proliferation involves excessive oxidative stress and p38 MAPK signaling. Our study further proposes that HHcy is a potential risk factor for elderly frailty, and need to be considered as a therapeutic target while designing the alleviation interventions/postinjury rehabilitation measures for adults with HHcy.

BACKGROUND: Cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine ß-synthase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase are endogenous enzymatic sources of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Functions of H2S are mediated by several targets including ion channels and signaling proteins. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 is responsible for the expression of antioxidant response element-regulated genes and is known to be upregulated by H2S. We examined the levels of H2S, H2S-producing enzymes, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 activation status in skeletal muscle obtained from critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients.METHODS AND RESULTS: Gastrocnemius tissues were attained postamputation from human CLI and healthy control patients. We found mRNA and protein levels of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine ß-synthase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle of CLI patients as compared to control. H2S and sulfane sulfur levels were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle of CLI patients. We also observed significant reductions in nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 activation as well as antioxidant proteins, such as Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in skeletal muscle of CLI patients. Biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl formation, were significantly increased in skeletal muscle of CLI patients as compared to healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that H2S bioavailability and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 activation are both attenuated in CLI tissues concomitant with significantly increased oxidative stress. Reductions in the activity of H2S-producing enzymes may contribute to the pathogenesis of CLI.

Chronic inflammation appears to play a critical role in sickness behavior caused by diabetes mellitus. Astaxanthin has been used in treating diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications because of its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions. However, whether astaxanthin can improve sickness behavior induced by diabetes and its potential mechanisms are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of astaxanthin on diabetes-elicited abnormal behavior in mice and its corresponding mechanisms. An experimental diabetic model was induced by streptozotocin (150 mg/kg) and astaxanthin (25 mg/kg/day) was provided orally for 10 weeks. Body weight and water consumption were measured, and the sickness behavior was evaluated by the open field test (OFT) and closed field test (CFT). The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was measured, and the frontal cortical cleaved caspase-3 positive cells, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) expression levels were also investigated. Furthermore, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) in the frontal cortex was detected to determine whether the protective effect of astaxanthin on sickness behavior in diabetic mice is closely related to CBS. As expected, we observed that astaxanthin improved general symptoms and significantly increase horizontal distance and the number of crossings in the OFT and CFT. Furthermore, data showed that astaxanthin could decrease GFAP-positive cells in the brain and down-regulate the cleaved caspase-3, IL-6, and IL-1ß, and up-regulate CBS in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that astaxanthin provides neuroprotection against diabetes-induced sickness behavior through inhibiting inflammation, and the protective effects may involve CBS expression in the brain.

Acute hypoxia depolarizes carotid body chemoreceptor (glomus) cells and elevates intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). Recent studies suggest that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may serve as an oxygen sensor/signal in the carotid body during acute hypoxia. To further test such a role for H2S, we studied the effects of H2S on the activity of TASK channel and [Ca(2+)]i, which are considered important for mediating the glomus cell response to hypoxia. Like hypoxia, NaHS (a H2S donor) inhibited TASK activity and elevated [Ca(2+)]i. To inhibit the production of H2S, glomus cells were incubated (3h) with inhibitors of cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (DL-propargylglycine, aminooxyacetic acid, ß-cyano-L-alanine; 0.3 mM). SF7 fluorescence was used to assess the level of H2S production. The inhibitors blocked L-cysteine- and hypoxia-induced elevation of SF7 fluorescence intensity. In cells treated with the inhibitors, hypoxia produced an inhibition of TASK activity and a rise in [Ca(2+)]i, similar in magnitude to those observed in control cells. L-cysteine produced no effect on TASK activity or [Ca(2+)]i and did not affect hypoxia-induced inhibition of TASK and elevation of [Ca(2+)]i. These findings suggest that under normal conditions, H2S is not a major signal in hypoxia-induced modulation of TASK channels and [Ca(2+)]i in isolated glomus cells.

Considering the significant role of plasma homocysteine in physiological processes, two ensembles (F465-Cu(2+) and F508-Cu(2+)) were constructed based on a BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) scaffold conjugated with an azamacrocyclic (1,4,7-triazacyclononane and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane) Cu(2+) complex. The results of this effort demonstrated that the F465-Cu(2+) ensemble could be employed to detect homocysteine in the presence of other biologically relevant species, including cysteine and glutathione, under physiological conditions with high selectivity and sensitivity in the turn-on fluorescence mode, while the F508-Cu(2+) ensemble showed no fluorescence responses toward biothiols. A possible mechanism for this homocysteine-specific specificity involving the formation of a homocysteine-induced six-membered ring sandwich structure was proposed and confirmed for the first time by time-dependent fluorescence spectra, ESI-MS and EPR. The detection limit of homocysteine in deproteinized human serum was calculated to be 241.4 nM with a linear range of 0-90.0 µM and the detection limit of F465 for Cu(2+) is 74.7 nM with a linear range of 0-6.0 µM (F508, 80.2 nM, 0-7.0 µM). We have demonstrated the application of the F465-Cu(2+) ensemble for detecting homocysteine in human serum and monitoring the activity of cystathionine ß-synthase in vitro.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can act as a signaling molecule for various ion channels and/or transporters; however, little is known about its potential involvement in Ca(2+) balance. Using developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an in vivo model system, the present study demonstrated that acute exposure to H2S donors increased Ca(2+) influx at 4 days postfertilization, while chronic (3-day) exposure caused a rise in whole body Ca(2+) levels. The mRNA expression of Ca(2+)-transport-related genes was unaffected by H2S exposure, suggesting that posttranscriptional modifications were responsible for the altered rates of Ca(2+) uptake. Indeed, treatment of fish with the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 abolished the H2S-mediated stimulation of Ca(2+) influx, suggesting that H2S increased Ca(2+) influx by activating cAMP-protein kinase A pathways. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) are two key enzymes in the endogenous synthesis of H2S. Using an antisense morpholino knockdown approach, we demonstrated that Ca(2+) influx was reduced in CBS isoform b (CBSb)- but not in CSE-deficient fish. Interestingly, the reduction in Ca(2+) influx in CBSb-deficient fish was observed only in fish that were acclimated to low-Ca(2+) water (i.e., 25 µM Ca(2+); control: 250 µM Ca(2+)). Similarly, mRNA expression of cbsb but not cse was increased in fish acclimated to low-Ca(2+) water. Results from whole-mount immunohistochemistry further revealed that CBSb was expressed in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase-rich cells, which are implicated in Ca(2+) uptake in zebrafish larvae. Collectively, the present study suggests a novel role for H2S in promoting Ca(2+) influx, particularly in a low-Ca(2+) environment.

OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects of vitamin B6, cofactor for cystathionine-<U+03B3> lyase and cystathionine-ß synthase (producers of H2S), alone and in combination with L-cysteine, H2S precursor, on indomethacin-, and ethanol-induced gastric lesions in male NMRI mice.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fasted male NMRI mice were randomly assigned into 12 groups (7 in each). The gastroprotective activity of vitamin B6 alone and in combination with L-cysteine and sodium hydrosulfate (NaHS) was evaluated against ethanol-, and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions. The animals were received vehicle, vitamin B6, L-cysteine, L-cysteine+vitamin B6, NaHS or NaHS+B6 before the induction of gastric lesions by ethanol (50%, 0.5 ml/25 g of body weight, orally) or indomethacin (40 mg/kg, orally). One and five hours after the administration of ethanol and indomethacin, respectively, the animals were sacrificed using anesthetics. The stomachs were removed, rinsed with normal saline and assessed for gastric wall mucus changes.RESULTS: Pretreatment with L-cysteine, sodium hydrosulfate, and vitamin B6 significantly decreased the total area of gastric lesions (P&lt;0.01). The mucus production in L-cysteine-, sodium hydrosulfate-, and vitamin B6-treated animals were significantly higher than in control rats P&lt;0.05). The gastroprotective activity of L-cysteine and sodium hydrosulfate in combination with vitamin B6 were higher than when administered alone (P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The result of this survey showed that the protective activity of L-cysteine and sodium hydrosulfate enhances in the presence of vitamin B6.

AIM: To investigate the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on smooth muscle motility in the gastric fundus.METHODS: The expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in cultured smooth muscle cells from the gastric fundus was examined by the immunocytochemistry technique. The tension of the gastric fundus smooth muscle was recorded by an isometric force transducer under the condition of isometric contraction with each end of the smooth muscle strip tied with a silk thread. Intracellular recording was used to identify whether hydrogen sulfide affects the resting membrane potential of the gastric fundus in vitro. Cells were freshly separated from the gastric fundus of mice using a variety of enzyme digestion methods and whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to find the effects of hydrogen sulfide on voltage-dependent potassium channel and calcium channel. Calcium imaging with fura-3AM loading was used to investigate the mechanism by which hydrogen sulfide regulates gastric fundus motility in cultured smooth muscle cells.RESULTS: We found that both CBS and CSE were expressed in the cultured smooth muscle cells from the gastric fundus and that H2S increased the smooth muscle tension of the gastric fundus in mice at low concentrations. In addition, nicardipine and aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a CBS inhibitor, reduced the tension, whereas N<U+03C9>-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase, increased the tension. The AOAA-induced relaxation was significantly recovered by H2S, and the NaHS-induced increase in tonic contraction was blocked by 5 mmol/L 4-aminopyridine and 1 µmol/L nicardipine. NaHS significantly depolarized the membrane potential and inhibited the voltage-dependent potassium currents. Moreover, NaHS increased L-type Ca(2+) currents and caused an elevation in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i).CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that H2S may be an excitatory modulator in the gastric fundus in mice. The excitatory effect is mediated by voltage-dependent potassium and L-type calcium channels.

BACKGROUND: Classic homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of sulfur metabolism. Clinical manifestations include mental retardation, dislocation of the optic lens (ectopia lentis), skeletal abnormalities and a tendency to thromboembolic episodes. We present the first mutational analysis of CBS in a Filipino patient with classic homocystinuria.METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood collected from a diagnosed Filipino patient with classic homocystinuria. The entire coding region of CBS (17 exons) was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and bidirectionally sequenced using standard protocols.RESULTS: The patient was found to be compound heterozygous for two novel mutations, g.13995G&gt;A [c.982G&gt;A; p.D328K] and g.15860-15868dupGCAGGAGCT [c.1083-1091dupGCAGGAGCT; p. Q362-L364dupQEL]. Four known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs234706, rs1801181, rs706208 and rs706209) were also detected in the present patient's CBS. The patient was heterozygous for all the identified alleles.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first mutational analysis of CBS done in a Filipino patient with classic homocystinuria who presented with a novel duplication mutation and a novel missense mutation. Homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency is a heterogeneous disorder at the molecular level.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine-ß-synthase deficiency (CBS deficiency) usually presents with ectopia lentis, myopia, intellectual disability, skeletal anomalies resembling Marfan syndrome, and thromboembolic events. Whereas neurodevelopment impairments have been often described in untreated homocystinuria adult patients, acute psychosis has rarely been reported as a presenting symptom of the disease. Here, we describe a 17-year-old girl affected by CBS deficiency presenting acute onset of visual hallucinations, behavioral perseverance, psychomotor hyperactivity, and affective inappropriateness. Ectopia lentis, diagnosed several years before, didn't have been considered as possible sign of a metabolic disorder. Psychotic symptoms were unresponsive to the conventional antipsychotic drugs and relieved after pyridoxine and folic acid treatment.</AbstractText>: Homocystinuria due to cystathionine-ß-synthase deficiency (CBS deficiency) usually presents with ectopia lentis, myopia, intellectual disability, skeletal anomalies resembling Marfan syndrome, and thromboembolic events.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the endogenously produced gasotransmitter involved in the regulation of nervous system, cardiovascular functions, inflammatory response, gastrointestinal system and renal function. Together with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, H2S belongs to a family of gasotransmitters. H2S is synthesized from L-cysteine and/or L-homocysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and cysteine aminotransferase together with 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Significant progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of H2S biochemistry, signaling mechanisms and physiological role. H2S-mediated signaling may be accounted for not only by the intact compound but also by its oxidized form, polysulfides. The most important signaling mechanisms include reaction with protein thiol groups to form persulfides (protein S-sulfhydration), reaction with nitric oxide and related species such as nitrosothiols to form thionitrous acid (HSNO), nitrosopersulfide (SSNO(-)) and nitroxyl (HNO), as well as reaction with hemoproteins. H2S is enzymatically oxidized in mitochondria to thiosulfate and sulfate by specific enzymes, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase, rhodanese and sulfite oxidase. H2S donors have therapeutic potential for diseases such as arterial and pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, peptic ulcer disease, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and erectile dysfunction. The group of currently available H2S donors includes inorganic sulfide salts, synthetic organic slow-releasing H2S donors, H2S-releasing non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, cysteine analogs, nucleoside phosphorothioates and plant-derived polysulfides contained in garlic. H2S is also regulated by many currently used drugs but the mechanism of these effects and their clinical implications are only started to be understood.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with increased plasma homocysteine level, which is caused by down-regulation of hepatic cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity. CBS catalyzes the first step in the transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine, which contributes ~50% of the cysteine required for hepatic biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH), the most abundant antioxidant in cells. As the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g. exendin-4) effectively reverse hepatic steatosis, the effect of exendin-4 on both homocysteine and redox status was investigated in the livers of rats fed with high-fat diet (HFD). It was found that HFD down-regulated CBS protein expression, which was probably due to induction of rno-miR-376c expression in the liver. The level of GSH was markedly reduced, whereas the level of malonydialdehyde, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased in the livers of rats fed with HFD. Exendin-4 treatment increased hepatic CBS protein and GSH levels, and reduced malonydialdehyde level in hyperlipidemic rats. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists have beneficial effects on redox homeostasis in NAFLD.

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a major cause of discogenic low back pain and sciatica, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is becoming recognized for its involvement in a wide variety of processes including inflammation and nociception. The present study was designed to investigate the roles of the H2S signaling pathway in the regulation of expression and function of purinergic receptors (P2XRs) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from rats with LDH. LDH was induced by implantation of autologous nucleus pulposus (NP), harvested from rat tail, in lumbar 5 and 6 spinal nerve roots. Implantation of autologous NP induced persistent pain hypersensitivity, which was partially reversed by an intrathecal injection of A317491, a potent inhibitor of P2X3Rs and P2X2/3Rs. The NP induced persistent pain hypersensitivity was associated with the increased expression of P2X3Rs, but not P2X1Rs and P2X2Rs, receptors in L5-6 DRGs. NP implantation also produced a 2-fold increase in ATP-induced intracellular calcium signals in DRG neurons when compared to those of controls (P &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, NP implantation significantly enhanced expression of the endogenous hydrogen sulfide producing enzyme, cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS). Systematic administration of O-(Carboxymethyl) hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (AOAA), an inhibitor of CBS, suppressed the upregulation of P2X3R expression and the potentiation of ATP-induced intracellular calcium signals in DRG neurons (P &lt; 0.05). Intrathecal injection of AOAA markedly attenuated NP induced- persistent pain hypersensitivity. Our results suggest that sensitization of P2X3Rs, which is likely mediated by CBS-H2S signaling in primary sensory neurons, contributes to discogenic pain. Targeting CBS/H2S-P2X3R signaling may represent a potential treatment for neuropathic pain caused by LDH.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been reported to exacerbate stroke outcome in experimental models. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) has been implicated as the predominant H2S-producing enzyme in central nervous system. When SH-SY5Y cells were transfected to overexpress CBS, these cells were able to synthesize H2S when exposed to high levels of enzyme substrates but not substrate concentrations that may reflect normal physiological conditions. At the same time, these cells demonstrated exacerbated cell death when subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) together with high substrate concentrations, indicating that H2S production has a detrimental effect on cell survival. This effect could be abolished by CBS inhibition. The same effect was observed with primary astrocytes exposed to OGD and high substrates or sodium hydrosulfide. In addition, CBS was upregulated and activated by truncation in primary astrocytes subjected to OGD. When rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, CBS activation was also observed. These results imply that in acute ischemic conditions, CBS is upregulated and activated by truncation causing an increased production of H2S, which exacerbate the ischemic injuries. Therefore, CBS inhibition may be a viable approach to stroke treatment.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a familiar toxic gas that smells of rotten eggs. After the identification of endogenous H2S in the mammalian brain two decades ago, studies of this molecule uncovered physiological roles in processes such as neuromodulation, vascular tone regulation, cytoprotection against oxidative stress, angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and oxygen sensing. Enzymes that produce H2S, such as cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase have been studied intensively and well characterized. Polysulfides, which have a higher number of inner sulfur atoms than that in H2S, were recently identified as potential signaling molecules that can activate ion channels, transcription factors, and tumor suppressors with greater potency than that of H2S. This article focuses on our contribution to the discovery of these molecules and their metabolic pathways and mechanisms of action.

Plasma homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies. We evaluated whether selective homocysteine-lowering gene transfer beneficially affects cardiac remodeling and function in a model of pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Female C57BL/6 low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr (-/-)) cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs (+/-)) mice were fed standard chow (control mice) or a folate-depleted, methionine-enriched diet to induce hyperhomocysteinemia (diet mice). Three weeks after initiation of thisdiet, mice were intravenously injected with 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(10) viral particles of an E1E3E4-deleted hepatocyte-specific adenoviral vector expressing Cbs (AdCBS), with the same dose of control vector, or with saline buffer. TAC or sham operation was performed 2 weeks later. AdCBS gene transfer resulted in 86.4 % (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and 84.6 % (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) lower homocysteine levels in diet sham mice and diet TAC mice, respectively. Mortality rate was significantly reduced in diet AdCBS TAC mice compared to diet TAC mice during a follow-up period of 8 weeks (hazard ratio for mortality 0.495, 95 % CI 0.249 to 0.985). Left ventricular hypertrophy (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and interstitial myocardial fibrosis (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) were strikingly lower in control TAC mice and diet AdCBS TAC mice compared to diet TAC mice. Diastolic function in diet AdCBS TAC mice was similar to that of control TAC mice and was significantly improved compared to diet TACmice. AdCBS gene transfer potently reduced oxidative stress as evidenced by a reduction of plasma TBARS and a reduction of myocardial 3-nitrotyrosine-positive area (%). In conclusion, selective homocysteine lowering potently attenuates pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy via reduced oxidative stress.</AbstractText>: Plasma homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies. We evaluated whether selective homocysteine-lowering gene transfer beneficially affects cardiac remodeling and function in a model of pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Female C57BL/6 low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr (-/-)) cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs (+/-)) mice were fed standard chow (control mice) or a folate-depleted, methionine-enriched diet to induce hyperhomocysteinemia (diet mice). Three weeks after initiation of thisdiet, mice were intravenously injected with 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(10) viral particles of an E1E3E4-deleted hepatocyte-specific adenoviral vector expressing Cbs (AdCBS), with the same dose of control vector, or with saline buffer. TAC or sham operation was performed 2 weeks later. AdCBS gene transfer resulted in 86.4 % (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and 84.6 % (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) lower homocysteine levels in diet sham mice and diet TAC mice, respectively. Mortality rate was significantly reduced in diet AdCBS TAC mice compared to diet TAC mice during a follow-up period of 8 weeks (hazard ratio for mortality 0.495, 95 % CI 0.249 to 0.985).

Diastolic function in diet AdCBS TAC mice was similar to that of control TAC mice and was significantly improved compared to diet TACmice. AdCBS gene transfer potently reduced oxidative stress as evidenced by a reduction of plasma TBARS and a reduction of myocardial 3-nitrotyrosine-positive area (%). In conclusion, selective homocysteine lowering potently attenuates pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy via reduced oxidative stress.KEY MESSAGE: Plasma homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in epidemiological studies. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induces pressure overload. Selective homocysteine-lowering gene therapy reduces mortality after TAC. Selective homocysteine lowering attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis after TAC. Decreased homocysteine levels enhance diastolic function and lower oxidative stress.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) impairs re-endothelialization and accelerates vascular remodeling. The role of CD34(+)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2(+) progenitor cells (PCs) in vascular repair in HHcy is unknown. We studied the effect of HHcy on PCs and its role in vascular repair in severe HHcy (~150 µM), which was induced in cystathionine-ß synthase heterozygous mice fed a high-methionine diet for 8 weeks. Vascular injury was introduced by carotid air-dry endothelium denudation. CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells were examined by flow cytometry. HHcy reduced bone marrow (BM) CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells and suppressed replenishment of postinjury CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells in peripheral blood (PB). Donor green fluorescent protein-positive PC homing to the injured vessel was reduced in HHcy after CD34(+) PCs from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice were adoptively transferred following carotid injury. CD34(+) PC transfusion partially reversed HHcy-suppressed re-endothelialization and HHcy-induced neointimal formation. Furthermore, homocysteine (Hcy) inhibited proliferation, adhesion, and migration and suppressed ß1-integrin expression and activity in human CD34(+) endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) isolated from PBs in a dose-dependent manner. A functional-activating ß1-integrin antibody rescued Hcy-suppressed adhesion and migration in CD34(+) ECFCs. In conclusion, HHcy reduces BM CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) generation and suppresses CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cell mobilization and homing to the injured vessel via ß1-integrin inhibition, which partially contributes to impaired re-endothelialization and vascular remodeling.

In the present study, we investigate the inhibitory effect of novel H2S donors, AP67 and AP72 on isolated bovine posterior ciliary arteries (PCAs) under conditions of tone induced by an adrenoceptor agonist. Furthermore, we examined the possible mechanisms underlying the AP67- and AP72-induced relaxations. Isolated bovine PCA were set up for measurement of isometric tension in organ baths containing oxygenated Krebs solution. The relaxant action of H2S donors was studied on phenylephrine-induced tone in the absence or presence of enzyme inhibitors for the following pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX); H2S; nitric oxide and the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel. The H2S donors, NaSH (1 nM - 10 µM), AP67 (1 nM - 10 µM) and AP72 (10 nM - 1 µM) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine-induced tone in isolated bovine PCA. While the COX inhibitor, flurbiprofen (3 µM) blocked significantly (p &lt; 0.05) the inhibitory response elicited by AP67, it had no effect on relaxations induced by NaSH and AP72. Both aminooxyacetic acid (30 µM) and propargylglycine (1 mM), enzyme inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve to AP67 and AP72. Furthermore, the KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide (300 µM) and the NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME (100 µM) significantly attenuated (p &lt; 0.05) the relaxation effect induced by AP67 and AP72 on PCA. We conclude that H2S donors can relax pre-contracted isolated bovine PCA, an effect dependent on endogenous production of H2S. The inhibitory action of only AP67 on pre-contracted PCA may involve the production of inhibitory endogenous prostanoids. Furthermore, the observed inhibitory action of H2S donors on PCA may depend on the endogenous biosynthesis of NO and by an action of KATP channels.

Estrogens dramatically dilate numerous vascular beds with the greatest response in the uterus. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent vasodilator and proangiogenic second messenger, which is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). We hypothesized that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) selectively stimulates H2S biosynthesis in uterine artery (UA) and other systemic arteries. Intact and endothelium-denuded UA, mesenteric artery (MA), and carotid artery (CA) were obtained from ovariectomized nonpregnant ewes (n = 5/group) receiving vehicle or estradiol-17ß replacement therapy (ERT). Total RNA and protein were extracted for measuring CBS and CSE, and H2S production was determined by the methylene blue assay. Paraffin-embedded UA rings were used to localize CBS and CSE proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. ERT significantly stimulated CBS mRNA and protein without altering CSE mRNA or protein in intact and denuded UA. Quantitative immunofluorescence microscopic analyses showed CBS and CSE protein localization in endothelium and smooth muscle and confirmed that ERT stimulated CBS but not CSE protein expression in UA endothelium and smooth muscle. ERT also stimulated CBS, but not CSE, mRNA and protein expression in intact and denuded MA but not CA in ovariectomized ewes. Concomitantly, ERT stimulated UA and MA but not CA H2S production. ERT-stimulated UA H2S production was completely blocked by a specific CBS but not CSE inhibitor. Thus, ERT selectively stimulates UA and MA but not CA H2S biosynthesis by specifically up-regulating CBS expression, implicating a role of H2S in estrogen-induced vasodilation and postmenopausal women's health.

The effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on differentiation of 3T3L1-derived adipocytes was examined. Endogenous H2S was increased after 3T3L1 differentiation. The expression of the H2S-synthesising enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), was increased in a time-dependent manner during 3T3L1 differentiation. Expression of genes associated with adipogenesis related genes including fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2), a key regulator of this process, was increased by GYY4137 (a slow-releasing H2S donor compound) and sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a classical H2S donor) but not by ZYJ1122 or time-expired NaHS. Furthermore expression of these genes were reduced by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA, CBS inhibitor), DL-propargylglycine (PAG, CSE inhibitor) as well as by CSE small interference RNA (siCSE) and siCBS. The size and number of lipid droplets in mature adipocytes was significantly increased by both GYY4137 and NaHS, which also impaired the ability of CL316,243 (ß3-agonist) to promote lipolysis in these cells. In contrast, AOAA and PAG had the opposite effect. Taken together, we show that the H2S-synthesising enzymes CBS, CSE and 3-MST are endogenously expressed during adipogenesis and that both endogenous and exogenous H2S modulate adipogenesis and adipocyte maturation.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) regulates the colonic motility by modulating both L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels and large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on rat colonic samples to investigate the localization of the H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). The contractions of proximal colonic smooth muscle were studied in an organ bath system. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record both L-type calcium currents (ICa,L) and BKCa currents in colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from male Wistar rats.RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of CBS and CSE in mucosa, smooth muscle cells and myenteric neurons. The H2S donor NaHS inhibited spontaneous contractions of the longitudinal muscle and circular muscle strips in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effects were not blocked by tetrodotoxin. NaHS inhibited the peak ICa,L in colonic SMCs at a membrane potential of 0 mV. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship of L-type calcium channels was modified by NaHS, and the peak of the I-V curve was shifted to the right. NaHS (200 µ<U+039C>) evoked a significant rightward shift of the steady-state activation curve and inhibited the inactivation of L-type calcium channels. Furthermore, NaHS reversibly decreased the peak ICa,L in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, BKCa channels were significantly inhibited by NaHS, and the addition of NaHS caused a time- and dose-dependent reduction in the BKCa current.CONCLUSION: The relaxant effect of H2S on colonic muscle strips may be associated with the direct inhibition of H2S on L-type calcium channels. H2S may be involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in colonic SMCs of rat colon.

Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is the main cause of homocystinuria. Homocysteine (Hcy), methionine, and other metabolites of Hcy accumulate in the body of affected patients. Despite the fact that thromboembolism represents the major cause of morbidity in CBS-deficient patients, the mechanisms of cardiovascular alterations found in homocystinuria remain unclear. In this work, we evaluated the lipid and inflammatory profile, oxidative protein damage, and the activities of the enzymes paraoxonase (PON1) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in plasma of CBS-deficient patients at diagnosis and during the treatment (protein-restricted diet supplemented with pyridoxine, folic acid, betaine, and vitamin B12). We also investigated the effect of folic acid and vitamin B12 on these parameters. We found a significant decrease in HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA-1) levels, as well as in PON1 activity in both untreated and treated CBS-deficient patients when compared to controls. BuChE activity and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in not treated patients. Furthermore, significant positive correlations between PON1 activity and sulphydryl groups and between IL-6 levels and carbonyl content were verified. Moreover, vitamin B12 was positively correlated with PON1 and ApoA-1 levels, while folic acid was inversely correlated with total Hcy concentration, demonstrating the importance of this treatment. Our results also demonstrated that CBS-deficient patients presented important alterations in biochemical parameters, possibly caused by the metabolites of Hcy, as well as by oxidative stress, and that the adequate adherence to the treatment is essential to revert or prevent these alterations.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), expressed in astrocytes, generates a gaseous neuromodulator, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the central nervous system (CNS). However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of astrocytic CBS expression and activity. This study evaluated the influence of neurons on astrocytic CBS expression by employing multiple culture systems. Substantial CBS expression was observed in the intact neonatal rat spinal cord, while CBS content was markedly reduced in an astrocyte-enriched culture prepared from the neonatal spinal cord. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the localization of spinal cord CBS in astrocytes, but not in neurons. Although CBS expression was weak in the embryonic rat spinal cord, enzyme levels were time-dependently increased in a neuron/astrocyte mixed culture originating from embryonic spinal cord. The reduced CBS expression in isolated neonatal astrocytes was restored by co-culture with embryonic neurons. Together with the observed CBS expression levels, H2S production was relatively low in astrocytes cultured alone, but was considerably higher in astrocytes cultured with neurons. These results indicate that neurons are essential for maintaining the expression and H2S-producing activity of astrocytic CBS in the rat spinal cord.

Our previous study showed that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could alleviate the cognitive deficits in vascular dementia (VD) rats associated with the improvement of synaptic plasticity. Neural oscillations are reported to interact with each other through either identical-frequency or cross-frequency coupling. This study examined whether impaired neural couplings could be alleviated by H2S in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 of VD rats and explored its possible mechanism. A VD rat model was established by two-vessel occlusion. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a kind of H2S donor, was administered intraperitoneally (5.6 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. Local field potentials were simultaneously collected in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1. The effects of NaHS on the modulation of theta-gamma coupling were evaluated by using the measurements of both phase-phase coupling and phase-amplitude coupling, while several other approaches including behavior, electrophysiology, western blot, immunofluorescence staining were also employed. The results showed that NaHS significantly prevented spatial learning and memory impairments (p &lt; 0.01). NaHS considerably alleviated the impairment of neural coupling in VD rats in an identical-frequency rhythm and between cross-frequency bands. Moreover, the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) was markedly attenuated in VD rats. NaHS elevated the expression of CBS to maintain the intrinsic balance of H2S. Interestingly, it was observed that NaHS increased the protein expression of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 2A (NMDAR2A) in VD rats. In conclusion, the data suggest that NaHS played the neuroprotective role partly via modulating the expression of NMDAR2A in order to alleviate the impairments of neural couplings in VD rats.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a gaseous messenger and serves as an important neuromodulator in the central nervous system. This study aimed to clarify the role of H2 S within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) in the control of gastric function in rats.METHODS: Cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) is an important generator of endogenous H2 S in the brain. We investigated the distribution of CBS in the DMV using immunohistochemical method, and the effects of H2 S on gastric motility and on gastric acid secretion.KEY RESULTS: CBS-immunoreactive (IR) neurons were detected in the rostral, intermediate and caudal DMV, with the highest number of CBS-IR neurons in the caudal DMV, and the lowest in the intermediate DMV. We also found that microinjection of the exogenous H2 S donor NaHS (0.04 and 0.08 mol/L; 0.1 µL; n = 6; p &lt; 0.05) into the DMV significantly inhibited gastric motility with a dose-dependent trend, and promoted gastric acid secretion in Wistar rats. Microinjection of the same volume of physiological saline (PS; 0.1 µL, n = 6, p &gt; 0.05) at the same location did not noticeably change gastric motility and acid secretion.CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: The data from these experiments suggest that the CBS that produces H2 S is present in the DMV, and microinjection of NaHS into the DMV inhibited gastric motility and enhanced gastric acid secretion in rats.

Our investigation showed that hepatocytes isolated from cysteine dioxygenase knockout mice (Cdo1(-/-)) had lower levels of hypotaurine and taurine than Cdo1 (+/+) hepatocytes. Interestingly, hypotaurine accumulates in cultured wild-type hepatocytes. DL-propargylglycine (PPG, inhibitor of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and H2S production) dramatically decreased both taurine and hypotaurine levels in wild-type hepatocytes compared to untreated cells. Addition of 2 mM PPG resulted in the decrease of the intracellular taurine levels: from 10.25 ± 5.00 observed in control, to 2.53 ± 0.68 nmol/mg protein (24 h of culture) and from 17.06 ± 9.40 to 2.43 ± 0.26 nmol/mg protein (control vs. PPG; 48 h). Addition of PPG reduced also intracellular hypotaurine levels: from 7.46 ± 3.55 to 0.31 ± 0.12 nmol/mg protein (control vs. PPG; 24 h) and from 4.54 ± 3.20 to 0.42 ± 0.11 nmol/mg protein (control vs. PPG; 48 h). The similar effects of PPG on hypotaurine and taurine levels were observed in culture medium. PPG blocked hypotaurine/taurine synthesis in wild-type hepatocytes, suggesting that it strongly inhibits cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme) as well as cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. In the presence of PPG, intracellular and medium cystathionine levels for both wild-type and Cdo1 (-/-) cells were increased. Addition of homocysteine or methionine resulted in higher intracellular concentrations of homocysteine, which is a cosubstrate for cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). It seems that PPG increases CBS-mediated desulfhydration by enhancing homocysteine levels in hepatocytes. There were no overall effects of PPG or genotype on intracellular or medium glutathione levels.

PURPOSE: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr) is a key enzyme in homocysteine-methionine metabolism. We investigated Mthfr expression in retina and asked whether mild hyperhomocysteinemia, due to Mthfr deficiency, alters retinal neurovascular structure and function.METHODS: Expression of Mthfr was investigated at the gene and protein level using quantitative (q) RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Mthfr+/+ and Mthfr+/- mice were subjected to comprehensive evaluation using ERG, funduscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), HPLC, and morphometric and IHC analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at 8 to 24 weeks.RESULTS: Gene and protein analyses disclosed widespread retinal expression of Mthfr. Electroretinography (ERG) revealed a significant decrease in positive scotopic threshold response in retinas of Mthfr+/- mice at 24 weeks. Fundus examination in mice from both groups was normal; FA revealed areas of focal vascular leakage in 20% of Mthfr+/- mice at 12 to 16 weeks and 60% by 24 weeks. The SD-OCT revealed a significant decrease in nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness at 24 weeks in Mthfr+/- compared to Mthfr+/+ mice. There was a 2-fold elevation in retinal hcy at 24 weeks in Mthfr+/- mice by HPLC and IHC. Morphometric analysis revealed an approximately 20% reduction in cells in the ganglion cell layer of Mthfr+/- mice at 24 weeks. The IHC indicated significantly increased GFAP labeling suggestive of Müller cell activation.CONCLUSIONS: Mildly hyperhomocysteinemic Mthfr+/- mice demonstrate reduced ganglion cell function, thinner NFL, and mild vasculopathy by 24 weeks. The retinal phenotype is similar to that of hyperhomocysteinemic mice with deficiency of cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs) reported earlier. The data support the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia may be causative in certain retinal neurovasculopathies.



#### Newborn screening for homocystinurias and methylation disorders: systematic review and proposed guidelines.

Newborn screening (NBS) is justified if early intervention is effective in a disorder generally not detected early in life on a clinical basis, and if sensitive and specific biochemical markers exist. Experience with NBS for homocystinurias and methylation disorders is limited. However, there is robust evidence for the success of early treatment with diet, betaine and/or pyridoxine for CBS deficiency and good evidence for the success of early betaine treatment in severe MTHFR deficiency. These conditions can be screened in dried blood spots by determining methionine (Met), methionine-to-phenylanine (Met/Phe) ratio, and total homocysteine (tHcy) as a second tier marker. Therefore, we recommend NBS for cystathionine beta-synthase and severe MTHFR deficiency. Weaker evidence is available for the disorders of intracellular cobalamin metabolism. Early treatment is clearly of advantage for patients with the late-onset cblC defect. In the early-onset type, survival and non-neurological symptoms improve but the effect on neurocognitive development is uncertain. The cblC defect can be screened by measuring propionylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine-to-acetylcarnitine ratio combined with the second tier markers methylmalonic acid and tHcy. For the cblE and cblG defects, evidence for the benefit of early treatment is weaker; and data on performance of Met, Met/Phe and tHcy even more limited. Individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for MAT1A mutations may benefit from detection by NBS using Met, which on the other hand also detects asymptomatic heterozygotes. Clinical and laboratory data is insufficient to develop any recommendation on NBS for the cblD, cblF, cblJ defects, glycineN-methyltransferase-, S-adenosylhomocysteinehydrolase- and adenosine kinase deficiency.

PURPOSE: To investigate the association between polymorphisms in genes that encode enzymes involved in folate- and vitamin B12-dependent homocysteine metabolism and recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA).METHODS: We investigated the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the methylenetetrahydrofalate reductase gene (MTHFR), the A2756G polymorphism of the methionine synthase gene (MS) and the 844ins68 insertion of the cystathionine beta synthetase gene (CBS). The PCR technique followed by RFLP was used to assess the polymorphisms; the serum levels of homocysteine, vitamin B12 and folate were investigated by chemiluminescence. The EPI Info Software version 6.04 was used for statistical analysis. Parametric variables were compared by Student's t-test and nonparametric variables by the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: The frequencies of gene polymorphisms in 89 women with a history of idiopathic recurrent miscarriage and 150 controls were 19.1 and 19.6% for the C677T, insertion, 20.8 and 26% for the A1298C insertion, 14.2 and 21.9% for the A2756G insertion, and 16.4 and 18% for the 844ins68 insertion, respectively. There were no significant differences between case and control groups in any of the gene polymorphisms investigated. However, the frequency of the 844ins68 insertion in the CBS gene was higher among women with a history of loss during the third trimester of pregnancy (p=0.003). Serum homocysteine, vitamin B12 and folate levels id not differ between the polymorphisms studied in the case and control groups. However, linear regression analysis showed a dependence of serum folate levels on the maintenance of tHcy levels.CONCLUSION: The investigated gene polymorphisms and serum homocysteine, vitamin B12 and folate levels were not associated with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage in the present study. Further investigations are needed in order to confirm the role of the CBS 844ins68 insertion in recurrent miscarriage.

Diabetes-induced kidney cell injury involves an increase in matrix protein expression that is only partly alleviated by current treatment, prompting a search for new modalities. We have previously shown that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) inhibits high glucose-induced protein synthesis in kidney podocytes. We tested whether tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction, ameliorates high glucose stimulation of matrix proteins by generating H2S in podocytes. Tadalafil abrogated high glucose stimulation of global protein synthesis and matrix protein laminin <U+03B3>1. Tadalafil inhibited high glucose-induced activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and laminin <U+03B3>1 accumulation in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. Tadalafil increased AMPK phosphorylation by stimulating calcium-calmodulin kinase kinase ß. Tadalafil rapidly increased the expression and activity of the H2S-generating enzyme cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) by promoting its translation. dl-Propargylglycine, a CSE inhibitor, and siRNA against CSE inhibited tadalafil-induced AMPK phosphorylation and abrogated the tadalafil effect on high glucose stimulation of laminin <U+03B3>1. In tadalafil-treated podocytes, we examined the interaction between H2S and nitric oxide (NO). N(<U+03C9>)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]-quinoxalin-1-one, inhibitors of NO synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase, respectively, abolished tadalafil induction of H2S and AMPK phosphorylation. Tadalafil rapidly augmented inducible NOS (iNOS) expression by increasing its mRNA, and siRNA for iNOS and 1400W, an iNOS blocker, inhibited tadalafil stimulation of CSE expression and AMPK phosphorylation. We conclude that tadalafil amelioration of high glucose stimulation of synthesis of proteins including matrix proteins in podocytes requires integration of the NO-H2S-AMPK axis leading to the inhibition of high glucose-induced mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activity and mRNA translation.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is considered as a novel gasotransmitter after reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in plants has dual character, that is, toxicity that inhibits cytochrome oxidase at high concentration and as signal molecule which is involved in plant growth, development, and the acquisition of tolerance to adverse environments such as extreme temperature, drought, salt, and heavy metal stress at low concentration. Therefore, H2S homeostasis is very important in plant cells. The level of H2S in plant cells is regulated by its synthetic and degradative enzymes, L-/D-cysteine desulfhydrase (L-/D-DES), sulfite reductase (SiR), and cyanoalanine synthase (CAS), which are responsible for H2S synthesis, while cysteine synthase (CS) takes charge of the degradation of H2S, but its reverse reaction also can produce H2S. Here, after crude enzyme is extracted from plant tissues, the activities of L-/D-DES, SiR, CAS, and CS are measured by spectrophotometry, the aim is to further understand homeostasis of H2S in plant cells and its potential mechanisms.

Hydrogen sulfide is an endogenous gaseous mediator that plays important roles in many physiological processes in microbes, plants, and animals. This chapter focuses on the important roles of hydrogen sulfide in protecting tissues against injury, promoting the repair of damage, and downregulating the inflammatory responses. The chapter focuses largely, but not exclusively, on these roles of hydrogen sulfide in the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrogen sulfide is produced throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and it contributes to maintenance of mucosal integrity. Suppression of hydrogen sulfide synthesis renders the tissue more susceptible to injury and it impairs repair. In contrast, administration of hydrogen sulfide donors can increase resistance to injury and accelerate repair. Hydrogen sulfide synthesis is rapidly and dramatically enhanced in the gastrointestinal tract after injury is induced. These increases occur specifically at the site of tissue injury. Hydrogen sulfide also plays an important role in promoting resolution of inflammation, and restoration of normal tissue function. In recent years, these beneficial actions of hydrogen sulfide have provided the basis for development of novel hydrogen sulfide-releasing drugs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that release small amounts of hydrogen sulfide are among the most advanced of the hydrogen sulfide-based drugs. Unlike the parent drugs, these modified drugs do not cause injury in the gastrointestinal tract, and do not interfere with healing of preexisting damage. Because of the increased safety profile of these drugs, they can be used in circumstances in which the toxicity of the parent drug would normally limit their use, such as in chemoprevention of cancer.

Pharmacological concentrations of H2S donors inhibit some T cell functions by inhibiting mitochondrial function, but evidence is also emerging that H2S at physiological concentrations produced via chemical sources and endogenously is a positive physiological mediator of T cell function. Expression of the H2S biosynthetic enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is induced in response to T cell receptor signaling. Inhibiting the induction of these enzymes limits T cell activation and proliferation, which can be overcome by exposure to exogenous H2S at submicromolar concentrations. Exogenous H2S at physiological concentrations increases the ability of T cells to form an immunological synapse by altering cytoskeletal actin dynamics and increasing the reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center. Downstream, H2S enhances T cell receptor-dependent induction of CD69, CD25, and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene expression. The T cell stimulatory activity of H2S is enhanced under hypoxic conditions that limit its oxidative metabolism by mitochondrial and nonenzymatic processes. Studies of the receptor CD47 have revealed the first endogenous inhibitory signaling pathway that regulates H2S signaling in T cells. Binding of the secreted protein thrombospondin-1 to CD47 elicits signals that block the stimulatory activity of exogenous H2S on T cell activation and limit the induction of CSE and CBS gene expression. CD47 signaling thereby inhibits T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation.

Elevated plasma homocysteine levels are considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Experimental evidence has shown that hydrogen sulfide anion (HS(-)) protects the myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Both homocysteine levels and endogenous HS(-) production are mainly regulated by two transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). We hypothesized that the transsulfuration pathway plays essential roles in the development of cardiac adaptive responses against ischemia, and investigated the roles of homocysteine, HS(-), and transsulfuration enzymes in fasting-induced cardioprotection against IR injury utilizing hyperhomocysteinemic Cbs (-/-) and Cth (-/-) mice. Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to 25-min global ischemia, followed by 60-min reperfusion. Two-day fasting ameliorated left ventricular dysfunction after reperfusion via propargylglycine- and glibenclamide-sensitive pathways in wild-type mice but not in Cbs (-/-) or Cth (-/-) mice, although fasting induced cardiac expression of several Nrf2 target antioxidant genes in both wild-type and Cth (-/-) mice. Intraperitoneal administration of sodium hydrosulfide (a HS(-) donor) at 24 h prior to IR improved myocardial recovery in wild-type mice but not in Cth (-/-) or high-methionine-diet-fed (thus intermediately hyperhomocysteinemic) wild-type mice. Quantitative analysis of reactive sulfur species using monobromobimane derivatization methods revealed that homocysteine efficiently captures HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide in the hearts as well as in the in vitro reactions. Here we propose a novel molecular and pathophysiological basis for hyperhomocysteinemia; excessive circulatory homocysteine interferes with HS(-)-related cardioprotection against IR injury by capturing endogenous HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide.</AbstractText>: Elevated plasma homocysteine levels are considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

H2S-producing enzymes, CBS and CTH, are essential in fasting-induced cardioprotection. Administration of a H2S donor (NaHS) confers cardioprotection against IR injury. NaHS effects are absent in Cth (-/-), Cbs (-/-), and dietary hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Homocysteine captures cardioprotective HS(-) to form homocysteine persulfide.

AIM: To evaluate the effect of ginkgolide B treatment on vascular endothelial function in diabetic rats.METHODS: The study included four groups with 15 male Sprague-Dawley rats: control group; control group treated with ginkgolide B; diabetic group; and diabetic treated with ginkgolide B. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde content, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits, and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) protein expression were determined in aortic tissues. Vasoconstriction to phenylephrine (PHE) and vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were assessed in aortic rings. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were measured, as well as cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß synthetase (CBS) protein expression, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity.RESULTS: Diabetes significantly impaired PHE-induced vasoconstriction and Ach-induced vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), reduced NO bioavailability and H2S production (P&lt;0.001), SOD activity, and GPX1 protein expression (P&lt;0.001), and increased malondialdehyde content and NADPH oxidase subunits, and CSE and CBS protein expression (P&lt;0.001). Ginkgolide B treatment improved PHE vasoconstriction and Ach vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), restored SOD (P=0.005) and eNOS (P&lt;0.001) activities, H2S production (P=0.044) and decreased malondialdehyde content (P=0.014). Vasorelaxation to SNP was not signi<U+FB01>cantly different in control and diabetic rats with or without ginkgolide B treatment. Besides, ginkgolide B increased GPX1 protein expression and reduced NADPH oxidase subunits, CBS and CSE protein expression.CONCLUSION: Ginkgolide B alleviates endothelial dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and elevating NO bioavailability and H2S production in diabetic rats.

H2S is produced from sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine and homocysteine, or a catabolite, 3-mercaptopyruvate, by three known enzymes: cystathionine ß-synthase, <U+03B3>-cystathionase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Of these, the first two enzymes reside in the cytoplasm and comprise the transsulfuration pathway, while the third enzyme is found both in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondrion. The following mitochondrial enzymes oxidize H2S: sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, sulfur dioxygenase, rhodanese, and sulfite oxidase. The products of the sulfide oxidation pathway are thiosulfate and sulfate. Assays for enzymes involved in the production and oxidative clearance of sulfide to thiosulfate are described in this chapter.

The cystine/glutamate transporter, designated as system xc(-), is important for maintaining intracellular glutathione levels and extracellular redox balance. The substrate-specific component of system xc(-), xCT, is strongly induced by various stimuli, including oxidative stress, whereas it is constitutively expressed only in specific brain regions and immune tissues, such as the thymus and spleen. Although cystine and glutamate are the well established substrates of system xc(-) and the knockout of xCT leads to alterations of extracellular redox balance, nothing is known about other potential substrates. We thus performed a comparative metabolite analysis of tissues from xCT-deficient and wild-type mice using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Although most of the analyzed metabolites did not show significant alterations between xCT-deficient and wild-type mice, cystathionine emerged as being absent specifically in the thymus and spleen of xCT-deficient mice. No expression of either cystathionine ß-synthase or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase was observed in the thymus and spleen of mice. In embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type embryos, cystine uptake was significantly inhibited by cystathionine in a concentration-dependent manner. Wild-type cells showed an intracellular accumulation of cystathionine when incubated in cystathionine-containing buffer, which concomitantly stimulated an increased release of glutamate into the extracellular space. By contrast, none of these effects could be observed in xCT-deficient cells. Remarkably, unlike knock-out cells, wild-type cells could be rescued from cystine deprivation-induced cell death by cystathionine supplementation. We thus conclude that cystathionine is a novel physiological substrate of system xc(-) and that the accumulation of cystathionine in immune tissues is exclusively mediated by system xc(-).

BACKGROUND: Classical homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency (OMIM 236200) is a recessively inherited condition caused by mutations in the CBS gene. The founder mutation p.R336C accounts for almost all CBS deficiency in Qatar, affecting approximately 1 in 1,800 births, making it the most prevalent monogenic disease among the Qatari population. Untreated patients can have severe intellectual disability (ID), devastating multisystem complications and premature death. Current treatment is based on pharmacology therapy and life-long methionine-restricted diet, which is difficult to maintain particularly in late diagnosed individuals. Data on the neurodevelopmental and psychological impact of the disease on outcomes among Qatari patients are generally lacking and have not been studied.OBJECTIVES: To examine the cognitive, educational and psychological outcomes of classical homocystinuria on Qatari patients.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two cases with classical homocystinuria and 25 sibling controls were recruited to evaluate the neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes. We reviewed the subjects' medical record and collected pertinent clinical and educational data from parents. Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test (Arabic translation - 4th ed.) was used for cognitive (IQ) testing.RESULTS: The mean age for the subjects was 11.2 years (range 0.6-29) with 56% males. The majority of cases (93%) carried the mutation (p.R336C), and parental consanguinity was 84%. There were no differences between the two groups in the fine motor, expressive language, behavioural and visual skills. However, cases have much lower total IQ particularly in the domains of short memory, quantitative reasoning and visual-spatial domains. A significant number of adolescents and adult cases had medical co-morbidities as well as behavioural and emotional problems.CONCLUSION: Individuals with classical homocystinuria have many developmental and cognitive difficulties with significant number of cases having learning disability and lower IQs (cf. sibling controls) with adolescents and adults more affected. Those diagnosed by newborn screening have better developmental and cognitive outcomes compared to late diagnosed cases. Psychological and psychiatric referrals should be part of the standard of care for those cases.

INTRODUCTION: The non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the drugs that can commonly cause injury in the esophagus, such as non-reflux oesophagitis, with important clinical consequences. This injury may be 'silent' and therefore often overlooked. Recently, we established that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a critical mediator of esophageal mucosal protection and repair. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of naproxen, the most commonly used NSAIDs, on the oesophagus and oesophagogastric junction and its relation with suppression or stimulation of endogenous H2S synthesis during naproxen-induced oesophageal injury.METHODS: Rats were treated with vehicle (control) or naproxen, with or without being subjected to water immersion restricted stress (Takagi et al. Chem Pharm Bul 12:465-472, 1964). Subgroups of rats were pre-treated with an inhibitor of H2S synthesis cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) or cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), or with the Sodium sulphide (NaHS), which spontaneously generates H2S in solution. Damage of the oesophageal mucosa and oesophagogastric junction was estimated and scored using a histological damage index.RESULTS: Treatment with naproxen increased the thickness of the corneal and epithelial layers of the oesophagus, as well as producing disorganization of the muscle plate and irregular submucosal oedema. Both injury factors, stress and suppression of H2S synthesis resulted in the development of severe esophagitis and damage to the oesophagogastric junction. The damage was exacerbated by inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis, and attenuated by treatment with NaHS.CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of endogenous H2S synthesis provides a novel experimental model that can be useful in preclinical studies NSAID-related non-reflux oesophagitis. H2S contributes significantly to mucosal defence in the oesophagus.

Recent studies have shown that smoking and alcoholism may be associated with altered DNA methylation and that alcohol consumption might induce changes in DNA methylation by altering homocysteine metabolism. In this monocenter study, we included 363 consecutive patients referred for hospitalization for alcohol detoxification treatment. Blood samples were obtained on treatment days 1, 3, and 7 for measurement of global DNA methylation in leukocytes by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA was used for genotyping the following seven genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism: cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) c.844_855ins68, dihydrofolate-reductase (DHFR) c.594 + 59del19bp, methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) c.677C &gt; T and c.1298A &gt; C, methyltetrahydrofolate-transferase (MTR) c.2756A &gt; G, reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) c.80G &gt; A, and transcobalamin 2 c.776C &gt; G. Multivariate linear regression showed a positive correlation of global DNA methylation with alcohol consumption and smoking on day 1 of hospitalization. DNA methylation was not correlated with homocysteine or vitamin plasma levels, nor with the tested genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism. This suggests a direct effect of alcohol consumption and smoking on DNA methylation, which is not mediated by effects of alcohol on homocysteine metabolism.

We determined the role of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and early BBB disruption following ischemic stroke. A cranial window was prepared over the left frontal, parietal and temporal cortex in mice. Transient focal cerebral Ischemia was induced by directly ligating the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for two hours. Regional vascular response and cerebral blood flow (CBF) during ischemia and reperfusion were measured in real time. Early BBB disruption was assessed by Evans Blue (EB) and sodium fluorescein (Na-F) extravasation at 3 hours of reperfusion. Topical treatment with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, an inhibitor for cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE)) and aspartate (ASP, inhibitor for cysteine aminotransferase/3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (CAT/3-MST)), but not O-(Carboxymethyl)hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (CHH, an inhibitor for cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)), abolished postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and prevented EB and Na-F extravasation. CSE knockout (CSE-/-) reduced postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia but only inhibited Na-F extravasation. An upregulated CBS was found in cerebral cortex of CSE-/- mice. Topical treatment with CHH didn't further alter postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia, but prevented EB extravasation in CSE-/- mice. In addition, L-cysteine-induced hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production similarly increased in ischemic side cerebral cortex of control and CSE-/- mice. Our findings suggest that endogenous production of H2S by CSE and CAT/3-MST during reperfusion may be involved in postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and play an important role in early BBB disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia.

Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic disorders due to impaired activity of enzymes, transporters, or cofactors resulting in accumulation of abnormal metabolites proximal to the metabolic block, lack of essential products or accumulation of by-products. Many of these disorders have serious clinical consequences for affected neonates, and an early diagnosis allows presymptomatic treatment which can prevent severe permanent sequelae and in some cases death. Expanded newborn screening for these diseases is a promising field of targeted metabolomics. Here we report the application, between 2007 and 2014, of this approach to the identification of newborns in southern Italy at risk of developing a potentially fatal disease. The analysis of amino acids and acylcarnitines in dried blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry revealed 24 affected newborns among 45,466 infants evaluated between 48 and 72 hours of life (overall incidence: 1<U+2009>:<U+2009>1894). Diagnoses of newborns with elevated metabolites were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, biochemical studies, and genetic analysis. Five infants were diagnosed with medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, 1 with methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria type CblC, 2 with isolated methylmalonic acidemia, 1 with propionic acidemia, 1 with isovaleric academia, 1 with isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, 1 with beta ketothiolase deficiency, 1 with short branched chain amino acid deficiency, 1 with 3-methlycrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency, 1 with formimino-transferase cyclodeaminase deficiency, and 1 with cystathionine-beta-synthase deficiency. Seven cases of maternal vitamin B12 deficiency and 1 case of maternal carnitine uptake deficiency were detected. This study supports the widespread application of metabolomic-based newborn screening for these genetic diseases.

The present study was designed to investigate the potential role of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in chronic stress-induced colonic hypermotility. Male Wistar rats were submitted daily to 1 h of water avoidance stress (WAS) or sham WAS (SWAS) for 10 consecutive days. The total number of fecal pellets was counted at the end of each 1 h of WAS or SWAS session. Organ bath recordings were used to test the colonic motility. H2S production of colon was determined, and immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed on rat colonic samples to detect the distribution and expression of H2S-producing enzymes. The results showed that i) repeated WAS increased the number of fecal pellets per hour and the area under the curve (AUC) of the spontaneous contractions of colonic strips (P &lt; 0.05), ii) repeated WAS decreased the endogenous production of H2S and the expression of H2S-producing enzymes in the colon devoid of mucosa and submucosa (P &lt; 0.001), iii) cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) was strongly expressed in the cytosols of the circular and longitudinal smooth muscle cells and the nucleus of the myenteric plexus neurons, iv) cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) was primarily localized in the cytosols of myenteric plexus neurons and weakly localized in the epithelial cells and v) inhibitors of H2S-producing enzymes increased the contractile activity of colonic strips in the SWAS rats (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the results suggest that the colonic hypermotility induced by repeated WAS may be associated with the decreased production of endogenous H2S.

AIMS: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality. Many studies have assessed the association between maternal gene polymorphisms involved in folate metabolism and the risk of having a DS offspring, but data are conflicting. Six common polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing genes were analayzed to determine possible risk factors for a child to be born having DS (DS mothers); these samples were taken from 47 Turkish mothers having DS children (case group) and 49 control mothers. Investigated polymorphisms include methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (rs1801133), A1298C (rs1801131), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G (rs1801394), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1) G1958A (rs2236225), reduced folate carrier (RFC1) A80G (rs1051266), and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) 844ins68.RESULTS: The frequency of the MTHFR 677C allele in DS mothers (79.8%) was significantly higher than in controls (66.3%), with a 0.499-fold increased risk of having a DS offspring (p=0.038 and 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.259-0.961). Mothers with the MTHFD1 1958A allele had a 1.880-fold increased risk of having a child with DS (p=0.031 and 95% CI, 1.060-3.335). No significant association was found for the other polymorphic variants in this study. Gene-gene interactions were not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Polymorphic variants of the enzymes involved in folate metabolism may play an important role in determining the susceptibility of having a DS offspring. The gene-nutrition, gene-gene interactions and ethnicity are important variables to be considered in future studies.

A library consisting of characterized marine natural products as well as synthetic derivatives was screened for compounds capable of inhibiting the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Eight hits were validated and shown to inhibit CBS activity with IC50 values ranging from 83 to 187µM. The majority of hits came from a series of synthetic polyandrocarpamine derivatives. In addition, a modified fluorogenic probe for H2S detection with improved solubility in aqueous solutions is reported.

Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is known to be produced endogenously in ocular tissues with the highest levels in the retina and cornea. However, it is yet unclear whether it can modulate retinal arterial tone. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness and the mechanism of the action of H2S in the isolated bovine retinal arteries. For this purpose, the probable vasorelaxant and inhibitory effects of H2S on vascular reactivity were tested comparatively in the retinal arteries by using the donor, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS). Thereafter, in relation to the mechanism of action of H2S, the role of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial vasodilators of cyclooxygenase pathway as well as ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), voltage-dependent potassium channel (Kv), calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa(++)), inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir), L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel and adenylate cyclase pathway were evaluated. NaHS (1µM-3mM) displayed prominent relaxations over the concentrations of 300 µM in both PGF2a and K(+) precontracted retinal arteries. Comparatively, in the presence of NaHS (3 mM) pretreatment, the maximum contractile responses and pEC50 values to PGF2a and K(+) were significantly reduced as well. Neither the presence of the known inhibitors of NO synthase, guanylate cyclase, cyclooxygenase, adenylate cyclase, KATP and KCa(++) type K(+) channels, and L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels nor the removal of endothelium, modified the relaxation response to NaHS in retinal arteries. However, a remarkable decrease was observed in the presence of the inhibitors of Kv or Kir type K(+) channels. In addition, administration of l-cysteine (1µM-3mM), the precursor of H2S, induced a modest relaxation response in PGF2a precontracted retinal arteries, which was significantly decreased in the presence of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid, but was unmodified in the presence of the cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) inhibitor, dl-propargylglycine or the deendothelization of retinal arteries. Our findings suggested that H2S might play a substantial role in the regulation of retinal arterial tone possibly by acting on Kv and Kir channels.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is considered the third gasotransmitter following nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the mammalian body including the brain, heart, blood vessels, liver, kidney, pancreas, lung, gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs. H2S is formed endogenously from L-cysteine by multiple enzymes, such as cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine-ß-synthase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in combination with cysteine aminotransferase, and participates in a variety of biological events through a number of target molecules. Exogenous and/or endogenous H2S enhances the activity of T-type Ca(2+) channels in NG108-15 cells and isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons that abundantly express Cav3.2, and in Cav3.2-transfected HEK293 cells. Cav3.2 mediates not only the H2S-induced enhancement of pain signals in nociceptor neurons, but also neuronal differentiation characterized by neuritogenesis and functional upregulation of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in NG108-15 cells. In this review, we focus on the functional modulation by H2S of primarily Cav3.2 T-type Ca(2+) channels and the molecular mechanisms underlying the H2S-induced neuronal differentiation.

Previously we reported that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays an important role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in diabetic kidney. Induction of NMDA-R and dysregulation of connexins (Cxs) were also observed. We concluded that this was due to decreased H2S production by downregulation of CBS and CSE enzymes. However, the potential role of H2S to mitigate ECM dysregulation and renal dysfunction was not clearly understood. The present study was undertaken to determine whether H2S supplementation reduces MMP-9-induced ECM remodeling and dysfunction in diabetic kidney. Wild type (C57BL/6J), diabetic (Akita, C57BL/6J-Ins2(Akita)), MMP-9 knockout (MMP-9(-/-), M9KO) and double KO of Akita/MMP-9(-/-) (DKO) mice were treated without or with 0.005 g/l of NaHS (as a source of H2S) in drinking water for 30 days. Decreased tissue production and plasma content of H2S in Akita mice were ameliorated with H2S supplementation. Dysregulated expression of MMP-9, CBS, CSE, NMDA-R1 and Cxs-40, -43 was also normalized in Akita mice treated with H2S. In addition, increased renovascular resistive index (RI), ECM deposition, plasma creatinine, and diminished renal vascular density and cortical blood flow in Akita mice were normalized with H2S treatment. We conclude that diminished H2S production in renal tissue and plasma levels in diabetes mediates adverse renal remodeling, and H2S therapy improves renal function through MMP-9- and NMDA-R1-mediated pathway.

Hydrogen persulfide and polysulfide (H2S(n)) are newly discovered intracellular reactive species considered to have high protein S-sulfhydration efficiency. The detection of H2S(n) in living systems is essential for studying their functions but is quite challenging. In this work, we report a two-photon excited fluorescent probe, QS(n), capable of tracking H2S(n) in living organisms. QS(n) exhibited turn-on two-photon fluorescence response upon reaction with H2S(n). With a favorable photophysical property, high specificity, and low cytotoxicity, QS(n) was able to recognize exogenous H2S(n) in living cells. More importantly, it realized for the first time the visualization of endogenous H2S(n) generated in cells overexpressing cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, the enzymes responsible for producing endogenous H2S(n). Taking advantage of two-photon microscopy, the probe was also applied to achieve H2S(n) detection in zebrafish embryos and to observe H2S(n) distribution in living organisms.

BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia plays an important role in the development of hepatic steatosis, and studies indicate that homocysteine-lowering treatment inhibits the development of fatty liver.OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of L-serine on alcoholic fatty liver and homocysteine metabolism.METHODS: In a binge ethanol study, male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: control, ethanol + vehicle, and ethanol + 20 or 200 mg/kg L-serine. Mice were gavaged with ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) 3 times every 12 h with or without L-serine which was given twice 30 min before the last 2 ethanol doses. Control mice were fed isocaloric dextran-maltose. In a chronic ethanol study, male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: control, ethanol, and ethanol + L-serine. Rats were fed a standard Lieber-DeCarli ethanol diet (36% ethanol-derived calories) for 4 wk with or without dietary L-serine supplementation (1%; wt:vol) for the last 2 wk. In control rats, the ethanol-derived calories were replaced with dextran-maltose. The effects of L-serine were also tested in AML12 cells manipulated to have high homocysteine concentrations by silencing the genes involved in homocysteine metabolism.RESULTS: Binge ethanol treatment increased serum homocysteine and hepatic triglyceride (TG) concentrations by &gt;5-fold vs. controls, which were attenuated in the 200-mg/kg L-serine treatment group by 60.0% and 47.5%, respectively, compared with the ethanol group. In the chronic ethanol study, L-serine also decreased hepatic neutral lipid accumulation by 63.3% compared with the ethanol group. L-serine increased glutathione and S-adenosylmethionine by 94.0% and 30.6%, respectively, compared with the ethanol group. Silencing betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, cystathionine ß-synthase, or methionine increased intracellular homocysteine and TG concentrations by &gt;2-fold, which was reversed by L-serine when L-serine-independent betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was knocked down.CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that L-serine ameliorates alcoholic fatty liver by accelerating L-serine-dependent homocysteine metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is an endogenous signalling molecule that might play a physiologically relevant role in gastrointestinal motility. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) are two enzymes responsible for H2S production. d,l-Propargylglycine (PAG) is a CSE inhibitor whereas both aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) and hydroxylamine (HA) are CBS inhibitors. The characterization of H2S responses and its mechanism of action are crucial to define H2S function.METHODS: Human colonic strips were used to investigate the role of H2S on contractility (muscle bath) and smooth muscle electrophysiology (microelectrodes). NaHS was used as a H2S donor.RESULTS: Combination of PAG and AOAA depolarized the smooth muscle (5-6mV, n=4) and elicited a transient increase in tone (260.5±92.8mg, n=12). No effect was observed on neural mediated inhibitory junction potential or relaxation. In the presence of tetrodotoxin 1µM, NaHS concentration-dependently inhibited spontaneous contractions (EC50=329.2µM, n=18). This effect was partially reduced by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ 10µM (EC50=2.6µM, n=12) and by l-NNA 1mM (EC50=1.4mM, n=8). NaHS reversibly blocked neural mediated cholinergic (EC50=2mM) and tachykinergic (EC50=5.7mM) contractions. NaHS concentration-dependently reduced the increase in spontaneous mechanical activity (AUC) induced by carbachol (EC50=1.9mM) and NKA (EC50=1.7mM AUC).CONCLUSIONS: H2S might be an endogenous gasomediator regulating human colonic contractility. Its inhibitory effect is observed at high concentrations and could be mediated by a direct effect on smooth muscle with a possible synergistic effect with NO, as well as by an interaction with the cholinergic and tachykinergic neural mediated pathways.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency or &quot;classical homocystinuria&quot; is a rare autosomal recessive condition resulting in altered sulfur metabolism with elevated methionine and homocysteine in plasma and homocystine in urine. This condition is characterized by a high clinical heterogeneity, which contributes to late clinical diagnosis, usually only made after irreversible damage has occurred. Treatment is effective if started before clinical symptoms. The analysis of methionine levels by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) allows the newborn screening for homocystinuria, but false-positive results can be frequently obtained and lead to the unwanted identification of methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT I/III) deficiency. This latter condition is biochemically characterized by isolated persistent hypermethioninemia, accompanied in some individuals with slightly elevated levels of homocysteine in plasma. A dominant form of MAT I/III deficiency, associated with mutation p.R264H, seems to be very frequent in the Iberian Peninsula and usually has a clinically benign course. Both these metabolic disorders are screened in Galicia and Portugal since the introduction of the MS/MS technology, in 2000 and 2004, respectively, resulting in the identification of three patients with classical homocystinuria and 44 patients with MAT I/III deficiency. All but one heterozygous parent of MAT I/III patients, identified with the p.R264H mutation, are healthy adults around the age of 30/40. The implementation of a second-tier test for homocysteine in dried blood spots would considerably reduce the number of MAT I/III-deficient patients identified and improve the specificity and positive predictive value for classical homocystinuria screening.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cystathione beta synthase (CBS) gene T833C, G919A, 844ins68 polymorphisms and plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels in ethnic Uyghur and Han patients with essential hypertension (EH) in Xinjiang.METHODS: Four hundred twenty nine cases including 211 Uyghur and 218 Han EH patients were recruited, whilst 410 healthy individuals including 210 Uyghurs and 200 Hans were used as the controls. Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was adopted to analyze the CBS gene polymorphisms including T833C, G919A and 844ins68. Enzymoimmunoassay was applied to determine the plasma level of Hcy. Chemiluminescence was applied to determine the plasma folic acid and vitamin B12.RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the plasma Hcy level was significantly higher in the EH group in both ethnic Uyghurs and Hans (P &lt; 0.05). Plasma levels of Hcy in T833C, G919A genotypes (for both heterozygotes and homozygotes) were statistically higher than wild types (P &lt; 0.05). A significant difference was detected in G919A polymorphism between the EH patients and controls in both Uyghur and [CM(144.5mm] Han ethnics (Uyghur: x² = 10.264, P &lt; 0.01; Han: x² = 23.075, P &lt; 0.01), and in T833C between the EH patients and controls in ethnic Uyghurs (x² = 40.254, P &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that age (OR=1.151, P=0.047, 95% CI = 1.002-1.323), T833C (CC) (OR = 1.078, P = 0.003, 95% CI = 1.043-1.114), obesity (OR = 1.284, P = 0.021, 95% CI = 1.038-1.590), hyperhomocysteine (OR = 3.296, P = 0.016, 95% CI = 1.244-8.733) were independent risk factors for EH among ethnic Uygurs, while age (OR = 1.162, P = 0.007, 95% CI = 1.042-1.297), obesity (OR = 3.501, P = 0.003, 95% CI = 1.521-8.060), hyperhomocysteine (OR = 1.046, P = 0.031, 95% CI = 1.011-1.459) were independent risk factors for EH in ethnic Hans after adjusting for confounding factors.CONCLUSION: Plasma level of Hcy is associated with ethnic Uyghur and Han patients with EH in Xinjiang. CBS gene T833C CC genotype may be associated with the EH among Uyghur ethnics.

In pulmonary epithelia, ß-adrenergic agonists regulate the membrane abundance of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and, thereby, control the rate of transepithelial electrolyte absorption. This is a crucial regulatory mechanism for lung liquid clearance at birth and thereafter. This study investigated the influence of the gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on ß-adrenergic agonist-regulated pulmonary sodium and liquid absorption. Application of the H2S-liberating molecule Na2S (50 µM) to the alveolar compartment of rat lungs in situ decreased baseline liquid absorption and abrogated the stimulation of liquid absorption by the ß-adrenergic agonist terbutaline. There was no additional effect of Na2S over that of the ENaC inhibitor amiloride. In electrophysiological Ussing chamber experiments with native lung epithelia (Xenopus laevis), Na2S inhibited the stimulation of amiloride-sensitive current by terbutaline. ß-adrenergic agonists generally increase ENaC abundance by cAMP formation and activation of PKA. Activation of this pathway by forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine increased amiloride-sensitive currents in H441 pulmonary epithelial cells. This effect was inhibited by Na2S in a dose-dependent manner (5-50 µM). Na2S had no effect on cellular ATP concentration, cAMP formation, and activation of PKA. By contrast, Na2S prevented the cAMP-induced increase in ENaC activity in the apical membrane of H441 cells. H441 cells expressed the H2S-generating enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, and they produced H2S amounts within the employed concentration range. These data demonstrate that H2S prevents the stimulation of ENaC by cAMP/PKA and, thereby, inhibits the proabsorptive effect of ß-adrenergic agonists on lung liquid clearance.

BACKGROUND: Rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) plays a crucial role in the central regulation of cardiovascular functions. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) is a major hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-generating enzyme that has been identified mainly in the brain. The present study was designed to examine CBS expression and determine its roles and mechanisms of regulating sympathetic outflow and blood pressure (BP) in the RVLM in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).METHODS AND RESULTS: CBS expression was decreased in the RVLM in SHR compared to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Accumulating evidences suggest that H2S interacts with nitric oxide (NO) to regulate cardiovascular function. Therefore, we hypothesize that the decrease in CBS expression in the RVLM may be involved in the disorder of l-arginine/NO pathway, which subsequently affects BP in SHR. Overexpression of CBS in the RVLM caused significant increases in BP, heart rate, and urinary norepinephrine excretion in SHR but not in WKY. Acute experiments were carried out at day 7 after gene transfer. NO metabolite levels, neuronal NO synthase, and <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid were decreased in SHR after CBS gene transfer. Furthermore, pressor responses to microinjection of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine into RVLM were blunt in SHR transfected with AdCBS compared to SHR transfected with AdEGFP.CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of CBS in the RVLM elicits enhanced pressor responses in SHR, but not in WKY, and the NO system is involved in these effects. The results suggest that alterations of H2S signaling in the brain may be associated with the development of hypertension.

INTRODUCTION: The cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism because it catalyzes the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, during which homocysteine is converted to cystathionine. Polymorphisms of CBS have been associated with cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined the role of the 844ins68 polymorphism by comparing the genotypes of 371 healthy Mexican women with the genotypes of 323 Mexican women with breast cancer (BC).RESULTS: The observed genotype frequencies for controls and BC patients were 1% and 2% for Ins/Ins, 13% and 26% for W/Ins, and 86% and 72% for W/W, respectively. We found that the odds ratio (OR) was 2.2, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.5-3.3, p = 0.0001. The association was also evident when comparing the distribution of the W/Ins-Ins/Ins genotypes in patients in the following categories: 1) menopause and high <U+03B3>-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels (OR of 2.17, 95% CI: 1.17-4.26, p = 0.02), 2) chemotherapy response and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.08-4.4, p = 0.027), 3) chemotherapy response and high GGT levels (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.2-4.8, p = 0.007), and 4) body mass index (BMI) and III-IV tumor stage (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.2-8.3, p = 0.013).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the genotypes W/Ins-Ins/Ins of the 844ins68 polymorphism in the CBS gene contribute significantly to BC susceptibility in the analyzed sample from the Mexican population.

Porcine oocytes that have matured in in vitro conditions undergo the process of aging during prolonged cultivation, which is manifested by spontaneous parthenogenetic activation, lysis or fragmentation of aged oocytes. This study focused on the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the process of porcine oocyte aging. H2S is a gaseous signaling molecule and is produced endogenously by the enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). We demonstrated that H2S-producing enzymes are active in porcine oocytes and that a statistically significant decline in endogenous H2S production occurs during the first day of aging. Inhibition of these enzymes accelerates signs of aging in oocytes and significantly increases the ratio of fragmented oocytes. The presence of exogenous H2S from a donor (Na2S.9H2O) significantly suppressed the manifestations of aging, reversed the effects of inhibitors and resulted in the complete suppression of oocyte fragmentation. Cultivation of aging oocytes in the presence of H2S donor positively affected their subsequent embryonic development following parthenogenetic activation. Although no unambiguous effects of exogenous H2S on MPF and MAPK activities were detected and the intracellular mechanism underlying H2S activity remains unclear, our study clearly demonstrates the role of H2S in the regulation of porcine oocyte aging.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of heat stress (HS) and methionine supplementation on the markers of stress and on the gene expression levels of uncoupling proteins (UCP), betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), glutathione synthetase (GSS) and glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPx7). Broilers from 1 to 21 d and from 22 to 42 d of age were divided into three treatment groups related to methionine supplementation: without methionine supplementation (MD); recommended level of methionine supplementation (DL1); excess methionine supplementation (DL2). The broilers were either kept at a comfortable thermal temperature or exposed to HS (38°C for 24 h). During the starter period, we observed the effects of the interaction between diet and environment on the gene expression levels of UCP, BHMT and GSS. Higher gene expression levels of UCP and BHMT were observed in broilers that were maintained at thermal comfort conditions and received the MD diet. HS broilers fed the DL1 and DL2 diets had the highest expression level of GSS. The expression levels of the CBS and GPx7 genes were influenced by both the environment and methionine supplementation. During the grower period, the gene expression levels of BHMT, CBS, GSS and GPx7 were affected by the diet × environment interaction. A higher expression level of BHMT was observed in broilers maintained at thermal comfort conditions and on the MD diet. HS induced higher expression levels of CBS, GSS and GPx7 in broilers that received the DL1 and DL2 diets. The present results suggest that under HS conditions, methionine supplementation could mitigate the effects of stress, since methionine contributed to the increased expression levels of genes related to antioxidant activity.

Although hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) elicits lower than normal body weights and skeletal muscle weakness, the mechanisms remain unclear. Despite the fact that HHcy-mediated enhancement in ROS and consequent damage to regulators of different cellular processes is relatively well established in other organs, the nature of such events is unknown in skeletal muscles. Previously, we reported that HHcy attenuation of PGC-1a and HIF-1a levels enhanced the likelihood of muscle atrophy and declined function after ischemia. In the current study, we examined muscle levels of homocysteine (Hcy) metabolizing enzymes, anti-oxidant capacity and focused on protein modifications that might compromise PGC-1a function during ischemic angiogenesis. Although skeletal muscles express the key enzyme (MTHFR) that participates in re-methylation of Hcy into methionine, lack of trans-sulfuration enzymes (CBS and CSE) make skeletal muscles more susceptible to the HHcy-induced myopathy. Our study indicates that elevated Hcy levels in the CBS-/+ mouse skeletal muscles caused diminished anti-oxidant capacity and contributed to enhanced total protein as well as PGC-1a specific nitrotyrosylation after ischemia. Furthermore, in the presence of NO donor SNP, either homocysteine (Hcy) or its cyclized version, Hcy thiolactone, not only increased PGC-1a specific protein nitrotyrosylation but also reduced its association with PPAR<U+03B3> in C2C12 cells. Altogether these results suggest that HHcy exerts its myopathic effects via reduction of the PGC-1/PPAR<U+03B3> axis after ischemia.

Hydrogen sulfide has been shown to have a sympathoinhibitory effect in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The present study examined the function of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)/hydrogen sulfide system in the RVLM, which plays a crucial role in the control of blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity. Adenovirus vectors encoding CBS (AdCBS) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (AdEGFP) were transfected into the RVLM in normotensive rats. Identical microinjection of AdCBS into the RVLM had no effect on systolic blood pressure and heart rate (HR) in conscious rats. Acute experiments were performed at day 7 after gene transfer in anesthetized rats. Microinjection of the CBS inhibitors hydroxylamine (HA) or amino-oxyacetate into the RVLM produced an increase in the renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and HR. There was a potentiation of the increases in RSNA, MAP, and HR because of the CBS inhibitors in AdCBS-injected rats compared with AdEGFP-injected rats. Pretreatment with pinacidil, a ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activator, abolished the effects of HA in two groups. Microinjection of glibenclamide, a KATP channel blocker, produced increases in RSNA, MAP, and HR in AdCBS-injected rats. No changes in behavior were observed in AdEGFP-injected rats. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated an increase in the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 2 and inward rectifier K(+) 6.1 in AdCBS-injected rats. These results suggest that the increase in KATP channels in the RVLM may be responsible for the greater sympathetic outflow and pressor effect of HA in AdCBS-injected rats compared with AdEGFP-injected rats.

OBJECTIVE: The discovery of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as pathogenic signaling molecules in airway-related diseases has led to significant insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development of allergic rhinitis (AR). The potential crosstalk between CO and H2S signaling pathways in AR has not been adequately investigated. This study was performed to elucidate the mechanistic relationship between CO and H2S in AR.STUDY DESIGN: Experimental prospective animal study.SETTING: Animal laboratory of Tongji Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A well-established model of AR was used whereby guinea pigs (N=24) were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups (n=6 for each group): The first group received ovalbumin only; the second group was administered exogenous hemin, a CO-binding metalloporphyrin; the third group received zinc protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of heme oxygenase-1. A control group was challenged using only saline. Symptoms of AR were recorded, and quantitation of plasma CO and H2S levels was performed. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 and H2S-generating enzyme cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) were measured from nasal mucosa.RESULTS: Plasma CO and heme oxygenase-1 expression levels of nasal mucosa were significantly increased in the AR group compared to controls, whereas H2S concentrations were significantly decreased. Exogenous administration of CO exacerbated allergic symptoms, resulting in higher levels of both CO and heme oxygenase-1 expression, and a further reduction in H2S levels and CSE expression. Zinc protoporphyrin decreased CO concentrations and increased levels of both H2S and CSE expression.CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated an inverse relationship between H2S levels and CO in the pathogenesis of AR.

OBJECTIVE: The effect of the gene polymorphism for the key enzyme's folacin metabolism pathway on plasmatic homocysteine (Hcy) levels in fertile woman was observed.METHODS: The subjects were from Shaoxing City, Jiangsu province in 2012, the selection criteria for the women of childbearing age were between 20-45 years old, with an average age of 28.2 (95%CI:27.8-28.6) years old. Sample collection continued uninterrupted lasted seven days, a total of 535 samples were collected, venous blood with EDTA addition or sodium citrate to anticoagulant. After separation, the blood cells and blood plasma were cryopreserved. DNA was extracted using spin column method. All the samples were selected for the gene polymorphism testing of the key enzyme's on folate metabolism and monitoring of plasmatic Hcy level.RESULTS: Eight single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) , methionine synthase gene (MS) , synthetic methionine reductase gene (MSR) and cystathionine ß synthase gene (CBS) were detected. It was found the genotype AA of the SNP sites-rs1801131 would result higher plasmatic Hcy levels (8.99 µmol/L) than the genotypes CC (7.81 µmol/L) and CA(8.38 µmol/L) (P &lt; 0.01) . Similarly, the genotype TT of the SNP sites-rs1801133 was significantly responded to the increasing of Hcy levels (11.10 µmol/L) than the genotype CC (8.15 µmol/L) and CT (8.45 µmol/L), (P &lt; 0.01) . The two sites of genotype combination of AA-TT could also result in the significant increase of Hcy levels (11.02 µmol/L) than other combined genotypes (genotypes CC-CC, CA-CC, CA-CT, AA-CC, AA-CT), especially the genotype CC-CC. And the risk factor was 1.41 (95CI:1.20-1.66) times over the genotype CC-CC.CONCLUSION: The gene mutations of two SNP sites rs1801131 and rs1801133 in MTHFR would increase Hcy levels.

Inhibitory neurotransmitters, chiefly nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal peptide, increase cyclic nucleotide levels and inhibit muscle contraction via inhibition of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase and activation of MLC phosphatase (MLCP). H2S produced as an endogenous signaling molecule synthesized mainly from l-cysteine via cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) regulates muscle contraction. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of CSE and H2S function in the regulation of MLCP activity, 20-kDa regulatory light chain of myosin II (MLC20) phosphorylation, and contraction in isolated gastric smooth muscle cells. Both mRNA expression and protein expression of CSE, but not CBS, were detected in smooth muscle cells of rabbit, human, and mouse stomach. l-cysteine, an activator of CSE, and NaHS, a donor of H2S, inhibited carbachol-induced Rho kinase and PKC activity, Rho kinase-sensitive phosphorylation of MYPT1, PKC-sensitive phosphorylation of CPI-17, and MLC20 phosphorylation and sustained muscle contraction. The inhibitory effects of l-cysteine, but not NaHS, were blocked upon suppression of CSE expression by siRNA or inhibition of its activity by dl-propargylglycine (PPG) suggesting that the effect of l-cysteine is mediated via activation of CSE. Glibenclamide, an inhibitor of KATP channels, had no effect on the inhibition of contraction by H2S. Both l-cysteine and NaHS had no effect on basal cAMP and cGMP levels but augmented forskolin-induced cAMP and SNP-induced cGMP formation. We conclude that both endogenous and exogenous H2S inhibit muscle contraction, and the mechanism involves inhibition of Rho kinase and PKC activities and stimulation of MLCP activity leading to MLC20 dephosphorylation and inhibition of muscle contraction.

Haemophilus influenzae is a small pleomorphic Gram-negative bacteria which causes several chronic diseases, including bacteremia, meningitis, cellulitis, epiglottitis, septic arthritis, pneumonia, and empyema. Here we extensively analyzed the sequenced genome of H. influenzae strain Rd KW20 using protein family databases, protein structure prediction, pathways and genome context methods to assign a precise function to proteins whose functions are unknown. These proteins are termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs), for which no experimental information is available. Function prediction of these proteins would surely be supportive to precisely understand the biochemical pathways and mechanism of pathogenesis of Haemophilus influenzae. During the extensive analysis of H. influenzae genome, we found the presence of eight HPs showing lyase activity. Subsequently, we modeled and analyzed three-dimensional structure of all these HPs to determine their functions more precisely. We found these HPs possess cystathionine-ß-synthase, cyclase, carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, pseudouridine synthase A and C, D-tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and aminodeoxychorismate lyase-like features, indicating their corresponding functions in the H. influenzae. Lyases are actively involved in the regulation of biosynthesis of various hormones, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, and DNA repair. Lyases are also considered as a key player for various biological processes. These enzymes are critically essential for the survival and pathogenesis of H. influenzae and, therefore, these enzymes may be considered as a potential target for structure-based rational drug design. Our structure-function relationship analysis will be useful to search and design potential lead molecules based on the structure of these lyases, for drug design and discovery.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a Janus-faced molecule. On one hand, several toxic functions have been attributed to H2S and exposure to high levels of this gas is extremely hazardous to health. On the other hand, H2S delivery based clinical therapies are being developed to combat inflammation, visceral pain, oxidative stress related tissue injury, thrombosis and cancer. Since its discovery, H2S has been found to have pleiotropic effects on physiology and health. H2S is a gasotransmitter that exerts its effect on different systems, such as gastrointestinal, neuronal, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and hepatic systems. In the gastrointestinal tract, in addition to H2S production by mammalian cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), H2S is also generated by the metabolic activity of resident gut microbes, mainly by colonic Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria (SRB) via a dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR) pathway. In the gut, H2S regulates functions such as inflammation, ischemia/ reperfusion injury and motility. H2S derived from gut microbes has been found to be associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome. This underscores the importance of gut microbes and their production of H2S on host physiology and pathophysiology.

Inflammation plays a critical role in kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury but mechanisms of increased proinflammatory cytokine expression are not completely understood. Kidney has a high expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) that can synthesize hydrogen sulfide. CBE and CSE are also responsible for the synthesis of cysteine, an essential precursor for glutathione, an antioxidant. Reduced hydrogen sulfide and glutathione production is associated with multiple organ injury. Although pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of hydrogen sulfide have been reported, its role in ischemia-reperfusion-induced inflammation in the kidney has not been well addressed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CBS and CSE-mediated hydrogen sulfide and glutathione production on kidney inflammatory response and the mechanism involved. The left kidney of Sprague-Dawley rat was subjected to 45-min ischemia followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Ischemia-reperfusion caused a significant decrease in CBS and CSE mRNA and protein levels with a concomitant reduction of glutathione and hydrogen sulfide production in the kidney while the expression of proinflammatory cytokine expression (MCP-1, IL-6) was elevated. Hypoxia-reoxygenation of proximal tubular cells led to a decrease in CBS and CSE expression and an increase in proinflammatory cytokine expression. Supplementation of glutathione or hydrogen sulfide donor (NaHS) effectively attenuated cytokine expression in tubular cells. These results suggested that ischemia-reperfusion impaired CBS and CSE-mediated glutathione and hydrogen sulfide production in the kidney, which augmented the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Regulation of CBS and CSE expression may be therapeutically relevant in alleviating ischemia-reperfusion-induced inflammation and improving kidney function.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenously produced gas that represents a novel third gaseous signaling molecule, neurotransmitter and cytoprotectant. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase with cysteine aminotransferase (3-MST/CAT) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase with d-amino acid oxidase (3-MST/DAO) pathways are involved in the generation of endogenous H2S despite the ubiquitous or restricted distribution of those enzymes. CBS, 3-MST/CAT and 3-MST/DAO can be found in the brain, while CSE is widely located in other organs. There also exist up-taking or recycling and scavenging mechanisms in H2S metabolism to maintain its persistence for physiological function. In recent years, investigating the role that H2S plays in the central nervous system and cardiovascular system has always been a hotspot. To date, effects of H2S are at least partially verified in multiple animal models or neuron cell lines of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemia, major depression disorders and febrile seizure, although subsequent studies are still badly needed. This article presents an overview of current knowledge of H2S focusing on its neuroprotective effects and corresponding signaling pathways, together with connections to potential therapeutic strategies in the clinic.

Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP; a B6 vitamer) serves as an important cofactor in a myriad of metabolic reactions, including the transsulfuration (TS) pathway, which converts homocysteine (Hcy) to cysteine. While overt vitamin B6 deficiency is rare, moderate deficiency is common and may be exacerbated by anti-pyridoxine factors in the food supply. To this end, we developed a model of moderate B6 deficiency and a study was conducted to examine the in vivo effect of 1-amino D-proline (1ADP), an anti-pyridoxine factor found in flaxseed, on indices of Hcy metabolism through the TS pathway in moderately B6 deficient rats. Male weaning rats received a semi-purified diet containing either 7 mg/kg (control; CD) or 0.7 mg/kg (moderately deficient; MD) diet of pyridoxine·hydrochloride (PN·HCl), each with 1 of 4 levels of 1ADP, viz. 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg diet for 5 weeks. Perturbations in vitamin B6 biomarkers were more pronounced in the MD group. Plasma PLP was significantly reduced, while plasma Hcy (8-fold) and cystathionine (11-fold) were increased in rats consuming the highest amount of 1ADP in the MD group. The activities of hepatic cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase enzymes were significantly reduced in rats consuming the highest 1ADP compared to the lowest, for both levels of PN·HCl. Dilation of hepatic central veins and sinusoids, mild steatosis and increased liver triglycerides were present in MD rats consuming the highest 1ADP level. The current data provide evidence that the consumption of an anti-pyridoxine factor linked to flaxseed may pose a risk for subjects who are moderate/severe vitamin B6 deficient.

Homocysteine is an amino acid that is toxic to vascular endothelial cells, and plasma elevations have been associated with venous thromboembolism. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia (&gt;100 µmol/L) may result from mutations in the genes coding for enzymes in the trans-sulfuration or the folate/vitamin B12-dependent re-methylation pathways. Here, we report the case of a young woman with severe, recurrent thrombo-embolic events associated with severe hyperhomocysteinemia (111 µmol/L). We identified a homozygous mutation in the cystathionine ß -synthase gene (p.I278T) and the presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation. Family study shows segregation of elevated homocysteine in heterozygous relatives for the mutation in the cystathionine ß -synthase gene. Management consisted of anticoagulation with warfarin and supplementation with folate, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and vitamin B12. After twelve years of follow-up, plasma homocysteine levels remain in the moderate range (~20 µmol/L, reference range 8-12 µmol/L) and no further thromboembolic events were identified.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Many studies have reported that serum total homocysteine (tHcy) levels in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) carriers are usually normal and only elevated after a methionine load. However, the amount of methionine required for a loading test is non-physiological and is never reached with regular feeding. Therefore, CBS carriers do not seem to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the risk of cardiovascular diseases of CBS carriers with folate deficiency has not been studied. We recently found an extraordinarily high carrier rate (1/7.78) of a novel CBS mutation (p.D47E, c.T141A) in an Austronesian Taiwanese Tao tribe who live in a geographic area with folate deficiency. We evaluated if the CBS carriers tend to have higher fasting serum tHcy concentrations than non-carriers in presence of folate deficiency.METHODS: The serum tHcy and folate levels before and after folate replacement were measured in 48 adult Tao carriers, 40 age-matched Tao non-carriers and 40 age-matched Han Taiwanese controls.RESULTS: The serum tHcy level of the Tao CBS carriers (17.9 ± 3.8 µmol/l) was significantly higher than in Tao non-carriers (15.7 ± 3.5 µmol/l; p &lt; 0.008) and Taiwanese controls (11.8 ± 2.9 µmol/l; p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, a high prevalence of folate deficiency in the Tao compared with the Taiwanese controls (4.9 ± 1.8 ng/ml vs. 10.6 ± 5.5 ng/ml; p &lt; 0.001) was also noted. Of note, the difference in tHcy levels between the carriers and non-carriers was eliminated by folate supplementation. (carriers:13.65 ± 2.13 µmol/l; non-carriers:12.39 ± 3.25 µmol/l, p = 0.321).CONCLUSIONS: CBS carriers tend to have a higher tHcy level in the presence of folate deficiency than non-carriers. Although many reports have indicated that CBS carriers are not associated with cardiovascular disease, the risk for CBS carriers with folate deficiency has not been well studied. Owing to a significantly elevated level of fasting tHcy without methionine loading, it is important to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease in CBS carriers with folate deficiency.

The key mechanism for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent formation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, a potent electrophile that forms protein adducts. Previous studies revealed the fundamental role of glutathione, which binds to and detoxifies N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine. Glutathione is synthesized from cysteine in the liver, and N-acetylcysteine is used as a sole antidote for acetaminophen poisoning. Here, we evaluated the potential roles of transsulfuration enzymes essential for cysteine biosynthesis, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH), in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity using hemizygous (Cbs(+/-) or Cth(+/-)) and homozygous (Cth(-/-)) knockout mice. At 4 h after intraperitoneal acetaminophen injection, serum alanine aminotransferase levels were highly elevated in Cth(-/-) mice at 150 mg/kg dose, and also in Cbs(+/-) or Cth(+/-) mice at 250 mg/kg dose, which was associated with characteristic centrilobular hepatocyte oncosis. Hepatic glutathione was depleted while serum malondialdehyde accumulated in acetaminophen-injected Cth(-/-) mice but not wild-type mice, although glutamate-cysteine ligase (composed of catalytic [GCLC] and modifier [GCLM] subunits) became more activated in the livers of Cth(-/-) mice with lower Km values for Cys and Glu. Proteome analysis using fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis revealed 47 differentially expressed proteins after injection of 150 mg acetaminophen/kg into Cth(-/-) mice; the profiles were similar to 1000 mg acetaminophen/kg-treated wild-type mice. The prevalence of Cbs or Cth hemizygosity is estimated to be 1:200-300 population; therefore, the deletion or polymorphism of either transsulfuration gene may underlie idiosyncratic acetaminophen vulnerability along with the differences in Cyp, Gclc, and Gclm gene activities.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a broad spectrum liver disorder diagnosed in patients without a history of alcohol abuse. NAFLD is growing at alarming rates worldwide. Its pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood. The cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) system regulates homocysteine and cysteine metabolism and contributes to endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) biosynthesis. This review summarizes our current understanding of the hepatic CBS/CSE system, and for the first time, positions this system as a potential therapeutic target in NAFLD. As will be discussed, the CBS/CSE system is highly expressed and active in the liver. Its dysregulation, presenting as alterations in circulating homocysteine and (or) H2S levels, has been reported in NAFLD patients and in NAFLD-associated co-morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Intricate links between the CBS/CSE system and a number of metabolic and stress related molecular mediators have also emerged. Various dysfunctions in the hepatic CBS/CSE system have been reported in animal models representative of each NAFLD spectrum. It is anticipated that a newfound appreciation for the hepatic CBS/CSE system will emerge that will improve our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, and give rise to new prospective targets for management of this disorder.

Detecting psychiatric disorders of secondary origin is a crucial concern for the psychiatrist. But how can this reliably be done among a large number of conditions, most of which have a very low prevalence? Metabolic screening undertaken in a population of subjects with psychosis demonstrated the presence of treatable metabolic disorders in a significant number of cases. The nature of the symptoms that should alert the clinician is also a fundamental issue and is not limited to psychosis. Hereditary metabolic disorders (HMD) are a rare but important cause of psychiatric disorders in adolescents and adults, the signs of which may remain isolated for years before other more specific organic signs appear. HMDs that present purely with psychiatric symptoms are very difficult to diagnose due to low awareness of these rare diseases among psychiatrists. However, it is important to identify HMDs in order to refer patients to specialist centres for appropriate management, disease-specific treatment and possible prevention of irreversible physical and neurological complications. Genetic counselling can also be provided. This review focuses on three HMD categories: acute, treatable HMDs (urea cycle abnormalities, remethylation disorders, acute intermittent porphyria); chronic, treatable HMDs (Wilson's disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis); and chronic HMDs that are difficult to treat (lysosomal storage diseases, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, creatine deficiency syndrome). We also propose an algorithm for the diagnosis of HMDs in patients with psychiatric symptoms.

Scientific appreciation for the subtlety of brain sulfur chemistry has lagged, despite understanding that the brain must maintain high glutathione (GSH) to protect against oxidative stress in tissue that has both a high rate of oxidative respiration and a high content of oxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids. In fact, the brain was long thought to lack a complete transsulfuration pathway (TSP) for cysteine synthesis. It is now clear that not only does the brain possess a functional TSP, but brain TSP enzymes catalyze a rich array of alternative reactions that generate novel species including the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the atypical amino acid lanthionine (Lan). Moreover, TSP intermediates can be converted to unusual cyclic ketimines via transamination. Cell-penetrating derivatives of one such compound, lanthionine ketimine (LK), have potent antioxidant, neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and antineuroinflammatory actions and mitigate diverse neurodegenerative conditions in preclinical rodent models. This review will explore the source and function of alternative TSP products, and lanthionine-derived metabolites in particular. The known biological origins of lanthionine and its ketimine metabolite will be described in detail and placed in context with recent discoveries of a GSH- and LK-binding brain protein called LanCL1 that is proving essential for neuronal antioxidant defense; and a related LanCL2 homolog now implicated in immune sensing and cell fate determinations. The review will explore possible endogenous functions of lanthionine metabolites and will discuss the therapeutic potential of lanthionine ketimine derivatives for mitigating diverse neurological conditions including Alzheimer<U+05F3>s disease, stroke, motor neuron disease, and glioma.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertension is a common clinical problem still poorly understood. The presence of GC receptor (GR) in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells suggests a direct role for GC in vasculature. In response to hemodynamic shear stress, endothelium tonically releases nitric oxide (NO), endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and prostacyclin contributing to vascular homeostasis. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been proposed as a candidate for EDHF. H2S is endogenously mainly formed from L-cysteine by the action of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). It plays many physiological roles and contributes to cardiovascular function. Here we have evaluated the role played by H2S in mesenteric arterial bed and in carotid artery harvested from rats treated with vehicle or dexamethasone (DEX; 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. During treatments systolic blood pressure was significantly increased in conscious rats. EDHF contribution was evaluated in ex-vivo by performing a concentration-response curve induced by acetylcholine (Ach) in presence of a combination of indomethacin and L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester in both vascular districts. EDHF-mediated relaxation was significantly reduced in DEX-treated group in both mesenteric bed and carotid artery. EDHF-mediated relaxation was abolished by pre-treatment with both apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of small and big calcium-dependent potassium channels respectively, or with propargylglycine, inhibitor of CSE. Western blot analysis revealed a marked reduction in CBS and CSE expression as well as H2S production in homogenates of mesenteric arterial bed and carotid artery from DEX-treated rats. In parallel, H2S plasma levels were significantly reduced in DEX group compared with vehicle. In conclusion, an impairment in EDHF/H2S signaling occurs in earlier state of GC-induced hypertension in rats suggesting that counteracting this dysfunction may be beneficial to manage DEX-associated increase in blood pressure.

Intellectual disability like other common diseases is often complex because they are genetically heterogeneous, with many different genetic defects giving rise to clinically indistinguishable phenotypes. We present diagnosis of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency in a multiply affected Iranian family with obvious intellectual disability based on whole genome SNP homozygosity mapping. Diagnosis based on clinical presentations had not been made because of unavailability of appropriate medical services. Genetic analysis led to identification of homozygous c.346G&gt;A in CBS that causes p.Gly116Arg in the encoded protein, cystathionine beta-synthase. CBS is the most common causative gene of homocystinurea. Later, the same mutation was found in three other apparently unrelated Iranian homocystinuria patients. p.Gly116Arg was reported once before in a Turkish patient, suggesting it may be a common CBS deficiency causing mutation in the Middle East. Clinical features of the patients are reported that evidence to variable presentations caused by the same mutation. Finally, observations in heterozygous carriers of the mutation suggest data that a single allele of the p.Gly116Arg causing mutation may have phenotypic consequences, including cardiac related phenotypes. Our study attests to the powers of genetic analysis for diagnosis especially for some forms of intellectual disability, with known genetic causing agents.

OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to investigate whether H2S can protect testicular germ cells against heat exposure induced injury and the underlying mechanisms.RESULTS: It was found that all three H2S generating enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lysase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3 MST), were expressed in mouse testicular tissue. Three episodes of heat exposure (42 °C, 30 min/day, 3 days) significantly decreased endogenous H2S production and down-regulated the expression of CBS and CSE in testes. In primary cultured testicular germ cells, exogenous application of NaHS (an H2S donor) attenuated heat stress (42 °C, 30 min) induced cell death and apoptosis. This was mediated by the inhibitory effects of H2S on cytochrome C release and the ratio of the Bax/Bcl-2. NaHS also improved mitochondrial function by decreasing oxygen consumption and increasing ATP production. NaHS treatment also stimulated SOD activity and reduced ROS production.CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed both physiological and pharmacological roles of H2S in testicular germ cells. Exogenous application of H2S may protect germ cells by preservation of mitochondrial function and stimulation of anti-oxidant activity.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous regulatory factor produced by several enzymes, and plays a pivotal role in processes such as proliferation or vasodilation. Recent reports demonstrated the physiological and pathophysiological functions of H2S in neurons. PTEN is a target of nitric oxide (NO) or hydrogen peroxide, and the oxidative modification of cysteine (Cys) residue(s) attenuates its enzymatic activity. In the present study, we assessed the effect of H2S on the direct modification of PTEN and the resulting downstream signaling. A modified biotin switch assay in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells revealed that PTEN is S-sulfhydrated endogenously. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that both Cys71 and Cys124 in PTEN are targets for S-sulfhydration. Further, the knockdown of cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) using siRNA decreased this modification in a manner that was correlated to amount of H2S. PTEN was more sensitive to NO under these conditions. These results suggest that the endogenous S-sulfhydration of PTEN via CBS/H2S plays a role in preventing the S-nitrosylation that would inhibition its enzymatic activity under physiological conditions.

Long-time glucocorticoids (GCs) usage causes osteoporosis. In the present study, we explored the potential role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) against dexamethasone (Dex)-induced osteoblast cell damage, and focused on the underlying mechanisms. We showed that two H2S-producing enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), were significantly downregulated in human osteonecrosis tissues as well as in Dex-treated osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. H2S donor NaHS as well as the CBS activator S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) inhibited Dex-induced viability reduction, death and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells. NaHS activated adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which participated its cyto-protective activity. AMPK inhibition by its inhibitor (compound C) or reduction by targeted-shRNA suppressed its pro-survival activity against Dex in MC3T3-E1 cells. Further, we found that NaHS inhibited Dex-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ATP depletion. Such effects by NaHS were again inhibited by compound C and AMPKa1-shRNA. In summary, we show that H2S inhibits Dex-induced osteoblast damage through activation of AMPK signaling. H2S signaling might be further investigated as a novel target for anti-osteoporosis treatment.

Induction of a proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) plays a role in memory impairment associated with various neurological disorders and brain injury. Here we show that IL-1ß-induced memory impairment in brain is mediated by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesized by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). H2S modifies GAPDH essentially via sulfhydration in dendrites, which promotes its binding to the E3 ligase protein, Siah. Then Siah binds to a critical synaptic scaffolding molecule, PSD95, and leads it to degradation via ubiquitination. In CBS heterozygous mice (cbs(+/-)) and primary neurons depleted with either CBS or IL-1R, IL-1ß-induced loss of PSD95 was rescued along with a decrease in the level of GAPDH sulfhydration. Moreover, decrease in the loss of PSD95 in cbs(+/-) mice results in improvement of IL-1ß-induced cognitive deficits and neurobehavioral outcomes. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism where GAPDH sulfhydration appears to be a physiologic determinant of cytokine-induced memory impairment in brain.

According to previous observations nitric oxide (NO), as well as an unknown nature mediator are involved in the inhibitory neurotransmission to the intravesical ureter. This study investigates the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) role in the neurogenic relaxation of the pig intravesical ureter. We have performed western blot and immunohistochemistry to study the expression of the H2S synthesis enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), measurement of enzymatic production of H2S and myographic studies for isometric force recording. Immunohistochemical assays showed a high CSE expression in the intravesical ureter muscular layer, as well as a strong CSE-immunoreactivity within nerve fibres distributed along smooth muscle bundles. CBS expression, however, was not consistently observed. On ureteral strips precontracted with thromboxane A2 analogue U46619, electrical field stimulation (EFS) and the H2S donor P-(4-methoxyphenyl)-P-4-morpholinylphosphinodithioic acid (GYY4137) evoked frequency- and concentration-dependent relaxations. CSE inhibition with DL-propargylglycine (PPG) reduced EFS-elicited responses and a combined blockade of both CSE and NO synthase (NOS) with, respectively, PPG and NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), greatly reduced such relaxations. Endogenous H2S production rate was reduced by PPG, rescued by addition of GYY4137 and was not changed by L-NOARG. EFS and GYY4137 relaxations were also reduced by capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents (CSPA) desensitization with capsaicin and blockade of ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channels, transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), vasoactive intestinal peptide/pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (VIP/PACAP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors with glibenclamide, HC030031, AMG9810, PACAP6-38 and CGRP8-37, respectively. These results suggest that H2S, synthesized by CSE, is involved in the inhibitory neurotransmission to the pig intravesical ureter, through an NO-independent pathway, producing smooth muscle relaxation via KATP channel activation. H2S also promotes the release of inhibitory neuropeptides, as PACAP 38 and/or CGRP from CSPA through TRPA1, TRPV1 and related ion channel activation.

Hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency confers diverse clinical manifestations. It is characterized by elevated plasma homocysteine levels, a common amino acid metabolized by remethylation to methionine or transsulfuration to cysteine. We recently found a relationship between hepatic Dyrk1A protein expression, a serine/threonine kinase involved in signal transduction in biological processes, hepatic S-adenosylhomocysteine activity, and plasma homocysteine levels. We aimed to study whether there is also a relationship between Dyrk1a and cystathionine beta synthase activity. We used different murine models carrying altered gene coy numbers for Dyrk1a, and found a decreased cystathionine beta synthase activity in the liver of mice under-expressing Dyrk1a, and an increased in liver of mice over-expressing Dyrk1a. For each model, a positive correlation was found between cystathionine beta synthase activity and Dyrk1a protein expression in the liver of mice, which was confirmed in a non-modified genetic context. The positive correlation found between liver Dyrk1a protein expression and CBS activity in modified and non-modified genetic context strengthens the role of this kinase in one carbon metabolism.

Activation of plasma membrane TGR5 receptors in enteroendocrine cells by bile acids is known to regulate gastrointestinal secretion and motility and glucose homeostasis. The endocrine functions of the gut are modulated by microenvironment of the distal gut predominantly by sulfur-reducing bacteria of the microbiota that produce H2S. However, the mechanisms involved in the release of peptide hormones, GLP-1 and PYY in response to TGR5 activation by bile acids and the effect of H2S on bile acid-induced release of GLP-1 and PYY are unclear. In the present study, we have identified the signaling pathways activated by the bile acid receptor TGR5 to mediate GLP-1 and PYY release and the mechanism of inhibition of their release by H2S in enteroendocrine cells. The TGR5 ligand oleanolic acid (OA) stimulated Gas and cAMP formation, and caused GLP-1 and PYY release. OA-induced cAMP formation and peptide release were blocked by TGR5 siRNA. OA also caused an increase in PI hydrolysis and intracellular Ca(2+). Increase in PI hydrolysis was abolished in cells transfected with PLC-e siRNA. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, a selective activator of Epac, stimulated PI hydrolysis, and GLP-1 and PYY release. L-Cysteine, which activates endogenous H2S producing enzymes cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase and cystathionine-ß-synthase, and NaHS and GYY4137, which generate H2S, inhibited PI hydrolysis and GLP-1 and PYY release in response to OA or 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP. Propargylglycine, an inhibitor of CSE, reversed the effect of L-cysteine on PI hydrolysis and GLP-1 and PYY release. We conclude: (i) activation of Gas-coupled TGR5 receptors causes stimulation of PI hydrolysis, and release of GLP-1 and PYY via a PKA-independent, cAMP-dependent mechanism involving Epac/PLC-e/Ca(2+) pathway, and (ii) H2S has potent inhibitory effects on GLP-1 and PYY release in response to TGR5 activation, and the mechanism involves inhibition of PLC-e/Ca(2+) pathway.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) against perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in rats by electroacupuncture (EA) and to examine its potential neuroprotective mechanism. NO content, the number of positive cells, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) in rat cortex cells were determined. The results demonstrated that treatment with EA significantly downregulated the NO content in the cortex cells (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, compared with the control groups) and alleviated cell damage in the cortex of rats with HIBD. The activator, S-adenosyl-L-methionine and the inhibitor, hydroxylamine of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), aggravated and remitted the hypoxic damage in the cortex cells, respectively. In addition, treatment with EA significantly downregulated the expression of nNOS and NF-<U+03BA>B in the rat cortex cells (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, compared with the control groups). The results also indicated that treatment with EA downregulated the NO content of cortical cells against HIBD via the NF-<U+03BA>B/nNOS pathway and further implied that the hydrogen sulfide/CBS system may be involved in the process. The present study provided a significant reference for the prevention and treatment of HIBD using the EA technique and also described a novel protective mechanism.

Chronic alcoholism can damage the cytoskeleton and aggravate neurological deficits. However, the effect of chronic alcoholism on hippocampal neurons remains unclear. In this study, a model of chronic alcoholism was established in rats that were fed with 6% alcohol for 42 days. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide content and cystathionine-beta-synthase activity in the hippocampus of rats with chronic alcoholism were significantly increased, while F-actin expression was decreased. Hippocampal neurons in rats with chronic alcoholism appeared to have a fuzzy nuclear membrane, mitochondrial edema, and ruptured mitochondrial crista. These findings suggest that chronic alcoholism can cause learning and memory decline in rats, which may be associated with the hydrogen sulfide/cystathionine-beta-synthase system, mitochondrial damage and reduced expression of F-actin.

Myotonia congenita (MC) is a skeletal muscle channelopathy characterized by inability of the muscle to relax following voluntary contraction. Worldwide population prevalence in humans is 1:100,000. Studies in mice, dogs, humans and goats confirmed myotonia associated with functional defects in chloride channels and mutations in a skeletal muscle chloride channel (CLCN1). CLCN1 encodes for the most abundant chloride channel in the skeletal muscle cell membrane. Five random bred cats from Winnipeg, Canada with MC were examined. All cats had a protruding tongue, limited range of jaw motion and drooling with prominent neck and proximal limb musculature. All cats had blepharospasm upon palpebral reflex testing and a short-strided gait. Electromyograms demonstrated myotonic discharges at a mean frequency of 300 Hz resembling the sound of a 'swarm of bees'. Muscle histopathology showed hypertrophy of all fiber types. Direct sequencing of CLCN1 revealed a mutation disrupting a donor splice site downstream of exon 16 in only the affected cats. In vitro translation of the mutated protein predicted a premature truncation and partial lack of the highly conserved CBS1 (cystathionine ß-synthase) domain critical for ion transport activity and one dimerization domain pivotal in channel formation. Genetic screening of the Winnipeg random bred population of the cats' origin identified carriers of the mutation. A genetic test for population screening is now available and carrier cats from the feral population can be identified.

Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are positively correlated with cardiovascular mortality in diabetes. However, the joint effect of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and hyperglycemia (HG) on endothelial dysfunction (ED) and the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. Mild (22 µmol/L) and moderate (88 µmol/L) HHcy were induced in cystathionine ß-synthase wild-type (Cbs(+/+)) and heterozygous-deficient (Cbs(-/+)) mice by a high-methionine (HM) diet. HG was induced by consecutive injection of streptozotocin. We found that HG worsened HHcy and elevated Hcy levels to 53 and 173 µmol/L in Cbs(+/+) and Cbs(-/+) mice fed an HM diet, respectively. Both mild and moderate HHcy aggravated HG-impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation to acetylcholine, which was completely abolished by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. HHcy potentiated HG-induced calpain activation in aortic endothelial cells isolated from Cbs mice. Calpain inhibitors rescued HHcy- and HHcy/HG-induced ED in vivo and ex vivo. Moderate HHcy- and HG-induced µ-calpain activation was potentiated by a combination of HHcy and HG in the mouse aorta. µ-Calpain small interfering RNA (µ-calpsiRNA) prevented HHcy/HG-induced ED in the mouse aorta and calpain activation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with DL-Hcy (500 µmol/L) and d-glucose (25 mmol) for 48 h. In addition, HHcy accelerated HG-induced superoxide production as determined by dihydroethidium and 3-nitrotyrosin staining and urinary 8-isoprostane/creatinine assay. Antioxidants rescued HHcy/HG-induced ED in mouse aortas and calpain activation in cultured HAECs. Finally, HHcy potentiated HG-suppressed nitric oxide production and eNOS activity in HAECs, which were prevented by calpain inhibitors or µ-calpsiRNA. HHcy aggravated HG-increased phosphorylation of eNOS at threonine 497/495 (eNOS-pThr497/495) in the mouse aorta and HAECs. HHcy/HG-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 was reversed by µ-calpsiRNA and adenoviral transduced dominant negative protein kinase C (PKC)ß2 in HAECs. HHcy and HG induced ED, which was potentiated by the combination of HHcy and HG via µ-calpain/PKCß2 activation-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 and eNOS inactivation.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme in sulfur metabolism, and its inherited deficiency causes homocystinuria. Mammalian CBS is modulated by the binding of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to its regulatory domain, which activates its catalytic domain. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and mass spectrometry (MS) on human CBS. The 1.7 Å structure of a AdoMet-bound CBS regulatory domain shows one AdoMet molecule per monomer, at the interface between two constituent modules (CBS-1, CBS-2). AdoMet binding is accompanied by a reorientation between the two modules, relative to the AdoMet-free basal state, to form interactions with AdoMet via residues verified by mutagenesis to be important for AdoMet binding (Phe(443), Asp(444), Gln(445), and Asp(538)) and for AdoMet-driven inter-domain communication (Phe(443), Asp(538)). The observed structural change is further supported by ion mobility MS, showing that as-purified CBS exists in two conformational populations, which converged to one in the presence of AdoMet. We therefore propose that AdoMet-induced conformational change alters the interface and arrangement between the catalytic and regulatory domains within the CBS oligomer, thereby increasing the accessibility of the enzyme active site for catalysis.

Classical homocystinuria is caused by mutations in the cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) gene. Previous experiments in bacterial and yeast cells showed that many mutant CBS enzymes misfold and that chemical chaperones enable proper folding of a number of mutations. In the present study, we tested the extent of misfolding of 27 CBS mutations previously tested in E. coli under the more folding-permissive conditions of mammalian CHO-K1 cells and the ability of chaperones to rescue the conformation of these mutations. Expression of mutations in mammalian cells increased the median activity 16-fold and the amount of tetramers 3.2-fold compared with expression in bacteria. Subsequently, we tested the responses of seven selected mutations to three compounds with chaperone-like activity. Aminooxyacetic acid and 4-phenylbutyric acid exhibited only a weak effect. In contrast, heme arginate substantially increased the formation of mutant CBS protein tetramers (up to sixfold) and rescued catalytic activity (up to ninefold) of five out of seven mutations (p.A114V, p.K102N, p.R125Q, p.R266K, and p.R369C). The greatest effect of heme arginate was observed for the mutation p.R125Q, which is non-responsive to in vivo treatment with vitamin B(6). Moreover, the heme responsiveness of the p.R125Q mutation was confirmed in fibroblasts derived from a patient homozygous for this genetic variant. Based on these data, we propose that a distinct group of heme-responsive CBS mutations may exist and that the heme pocket of CBS may become an important target for designing novel therapies for homocystinuria.

The RP-HPLC-based method of determination of the activity of cystathionine ß-synthase and <U+03B3>-cystathionase was undertaken in mouse liver, kidney and brain. Products of the reactions, such as cystathionine, a-ketobutyrate, cysteine and glutathione, were measured using the RP-HPLC method. A difference in the cystathionine level between homogenates with totally CTH-inhibiting concentrations of DL-propargylglycine and without the inhibitor was employed to evaluate the activity of cystathionine ß-synthase. Gamma-cystathionase activity was measured using DL-homoserine as a substrate and a sensitive HPLC-based assay to measure a-ketobutyrate. The results confirmed high cystathionine ß-synthase activity and no <U+03B3>-cystathionase activity in brain, and high <U+03B3>-cystathionase activity in mouse liver. The method presented here allows for evaluating the relative contribution of CBS and CTH to generation of H2S in tissues. Additionally, it provides results, which reflect the redox status (GSH/GSSG) of a tissue.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as a biological mediator with various roles such as neuromodulation, regulation of the vascular tone, cytoprotection, anti-inflammation, oxygen sensing, angiogenesis, and generation of mitochondrial energy. It is produced by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). The activity of CBS is enhanced by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and glutathionylation, while it is inhibited by nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). The activity of CSE and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), which produces the 3MST substrate 3-mercaptopyruvate (3MP), is regulated by Ca2+. H2S is oxidized to thiosulfate in mitochondria through the sequential action of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), sulfur dioxygenase, and rhodanese. The rates of the production and clearance of H2S determine its cellular concentration. Polysulfides (H2Sn) have been found to occur in the brain and activate transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels, facilitate the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus, and suppress the activity of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) by sulfurating (sulfhydrating) the target cysteine residues. A cross talk between H2S and NO also plays an important role in cardioprotection as well as regulation of the vascular tone. H2S, polysulfides, and their cross talk with NO may mediate various physiological and pathophysiological responses.

Recently, we reported that cancer cells that recover from a potentially lethal damage gain new phenotypic features comprised of mitochondrial structural remodeling associated with increased glycolytic dependency and drug resistance. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of cancer cells, upon recovery from a potentially lethal damage, undergo dedifferentiation and express genes, which are characteristic of undifferentiated stem cells. While these cells are competent in maintaining differentiated progeny of tumor, they also exhibit transdifferentiation potential. Dedifferentiation is characterized by accumulation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which triggers up-regulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) accompanied by changes in the redox state. The molecular events triggered by Nampt include elevated production of NAD(+) and up-regulation of H2S producing enzymes, cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) and cystathionase (CTH) with 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) being detectable only in 3D spheroids. Suppression of Nampt, or inactivation of H2S producing enzymes, all reduce H2S production and reverse the ability of cells to dedifferentiate. Moreover, H2S induced stem cell markers in parental cancer cells in a manner similar to that observed in damage recovered cells. These data suggest of existence of a positive feedback loop between H2S and Nampt that controls dedifferentiation in cancer cells that recover from a potentially lethal damage. 



#### Involvement of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in hypoxia-induced hypothermia.

Hypoxia evokes a regulated decrease in deep body temperature (Tb). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a signaling molecule that belongs to the gasotransmitter family, has been demonstrated to participate in several brain-mediated responses. Rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brainstem region involved in thermoregulation. Recently, it has been shown that exogenous H2S modulates RVLM activity. In the present study, we investigated whether endogenously produced H2S in the RVLM plays a role in the control of hypoxia-induced hypothermia. Tb was measured before and after bilateral microinjection of aminooxyacetate (AOA, 0.2, 1 and 2 pmol/100 nl, a cystathionine ß-synthase, CBS, inhibitor) or vehicle into the RVLM followed by a 60-min normoxia (21% inspired O2) or hypoxia (7% inspired O2) exposure. Microinjection of AOA or vehicle did not change Tb during normoxia. Exposure to hypoxia evoked a typical decrease in Tb. Microinjection of AOA (2 pmol) into the RVLM followed by hypoxia significantly attenuated the decrease in Tb. Thus, endogenous H2S in the RVLM seems to play no role in the maintenance of basal Tb, whereas during hypoxia this gas plays a cryogenic role. Moreover, RVLM homogenates of rats exposed to hypoxia exhibited a decreased rate of H2S production. Our data are consistent with the notion that during hypoxia H2S synthesis is diminished in the RVLM facilitating hypothermia.

Betaine is an important natural component of rich food sources, especially spinach. Rats were fed diets with betaine or spinach powder at the same level of betaine for 10 days to investigate the dose-dependent effects of spinach powder supplementation on hyperhomocysteinemia induced by guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) addition and choline deprivation. The GAA-induced hyperhomocysteinemia in rats fed 25% casein diet (25 C) was significantly suppressed by supplementation with betaine or spinach, and it was completely suppressed by taking 11.0% spinach supplementation. The choline deprivation-induced enhancement of plasma homocysteine concentration in rats fed 25% soybean protein diet (25S) was markedly suppressed by 3.82% spinach. Supplementation with betaine or spinach partially prevented the effects of GAA on hepatic concentrations of methionine metabolites. The decrease in activity of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) in GAA-induced hyperhomocysteinemia was recovered by supplementation with betaine or spinach. Supplementation with betaine or spinach did not affect BHMT activity, whereas it partially restored CBS activity in choline-deprived 25S. The results indicated that betaine or spinach could completely suppress the hyperhomocysteinemia induced by choline deficiency resulting from stimulating the homocysteine removal by both remethylation and cystathionine formation.

We recently demonstrated that cancer cells that recover from damage exhibit increased aerobic glycolysis, however, the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells survive the damage and show increased aerobic glycolysis remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that diverse cancer cells that survive hypoxic or oxidative damage show rapid cell proliferation, and develop tolerance to damage associated with increased production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which drives up-regulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt). Consistent with existence of a H2S-Nampt energetic circuit, in damage recovered cancer cells, H2S, Nampt and ATP production exhibit a significant correlation. Moreover, the treatment of cancer cells with H2S donor, NaHS, coordinately increases Nampt and ATP levels, and protects cells from drug induced damage. Inhibition of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) or cystathionase (CTH), enzymes which drive generation of H2S, decreases Nampt production while suppression of Nampt pathway by FK866, decreases H2S and ATP levels. Damage recovered cells isolated from tumors grown subcutaneously in athymic mice also show increased production of H2S, Nampt and ATP levels, associated with increased glycolysis and rapid proliferation. Together, these data show that upon recovery from potential lethal damage, H2S-Nampt directs energy expenditure and aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells, leads to their exponential growth, and causes a high degree of tolerance to damage. Identification of H2S-Nampt as a pathway responsible for induction of damage tolerance in cancer cells may underlie resistance to therapy and offers the opportunity to target this pathway as a means in treatment of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is released into plasma from organs expressing this enzyme. Decreased plasma CBS activity has been demonstrated in CBS-deficient patients with 16 different genotypes. The aim of this study was to determine plasma CBS activity in patients carrying 11 additional genotypes using two LC-MS/MS methods. Patients and methods CBS activity was measured in EDTA or heparin plasma using either a previously described or a newly developed LC-MS/MS method optimized for analysis of the reaction product, 3,3-(2)H2-cystathionine, as its butyl ester derivative. We analyzed plasma samples from 26 CBS-deficient patients with known genotypes and 57 controls.RESULTS: We developed a new LC-MS/MS method for simple and sensitive determination of CBS activity. Plasma CBS activity was low (i.e., 0.001-0.036 of the multiples of median control values, MoM) in patients homozygous for the prevalent Hispanic mutation c.572C&gt;T (p.T191M) but was highly elevated (2.95 MoM) in a single patient homozygous for the c.1330G&gt;A (p.D444N) mutation. Patients with the remaining nine genotypes exhibited decreased activities (0.00-0.22 MoM), which did not overlap with the controls (0.29-2.10 MoM).CONCLUSIONS: The determination of CBS activity in plasma is a rapid and non-invasive procedure for detecting a subgroup of CBS-deficient patients with distinct genotypes.

N-Acetylneuraminate lyase synthase (NeuB; E.C. 2.5.1.56) is a key enzyme in pathogenic microorganisms for producing N-acetylneuraminic acid through the irreversible condensation of N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). However, nothing is known about this enzyme in non-pathogenic bacteria. This paper describes, for the first time, one of the two putative N-acetylneuraminate synthases from the halophilic non-pathogenic gamma-proteobacterium Idiomarina loihiensis NeuB1 (IlNeuB1). The obtained 95-kDa dimeric enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 7.0 and 40°C and was more stable at pH 8.0 (8 h half-life) than the previously described NeuB. Its catalytic efficiency towards ManNAc and PEP was 10- and 40-fold higher, respectively, than that determined for Campylobacter jejuni NeuB, but only half that found for Neisseria meningitidis NeuB towards PEP. The phylogenetic and structural analyses of NeuB enzymes revealed the new domain architecture 4 has no cystathionine-ß-synthase domain (cystathionine-ß-synthetase domain), unlike domain architecture 3. In addition, 10 conserved blocks (I-X) were found, and surprisingly, this study showed that the arginine essential for catalysis that is present in antifreeze-like domain (block X) was not fully conserved in NeuB, but is replaced by a serine in a long sequence (&gt;700 residues) NeuB, such as that existing in domain architectures 3 and 4.

In humans, two main metabolic enzymes synthesize hydrogen sulfide (H2 S): cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß synthase (CBS). A third enzyme, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), synthesizes H2 S in the presence of the substrate 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP). The immunohistochemistry analysis performed on human melanoma samples demonstrated that CSE expression was highest in primary tumors, decreased in the metastatic lesions and was almost silent in non-lymph node metastases. The primary role played by CSE was confirmed by the finding that the overexpression of CSE induced spontaneous apoptosis of human melanoma cells. The same effect was achieved using different H2 S donors, the most active of which was diallyl trisulfide (DATS). The main pro-apoptotic mechanisms involved were suppression of nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B activity and inhibition of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. A proof of concept was obtained in vivo using a murine melanoma model. In fact, either l-cysteine, the CSE substrate, or DATS inhibited tumor growth in mice. In conclusion, we have determined that the l-cysteine/CSE/H2 S pathway is involved in melanoma progression.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a heme-dependent and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent protein that controls the flux of sulfur from methionine to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, taurine, and H2S. Deficiency of CBS activity causes homocystinuria, the most frequent disorder of sulfur amino acid metabolism. In contrast to CBSs from lower organisms, human CBS (hCBS) is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which binds to the regulatory domain and triggers a conformational change that allows the protein to progress from the basal toward the activated state. The structural basis of the underlying molecular mechanism has remained elusive so far. Here, we present the structure of hCBS with bound AdoMet, revealing the activated conformation of the human enzyme. Binding of AdoMet triggers a conformational change in the Bateman module of the regulatory domain that favors its association with a Bateman module of the complementary subunit to form an antiparallel CBS module. Such an arrangement is very similar to that found in the constitutively activated insect CBS. In the presence of AdoMet, the autoinhibition exerted by the regulatory region is eliminated, allowing for improved access of substrates to the catalytic pocket. Based on the availability of both the basal and the activated structures, we discuss the mechanism of hCBS activation by AdoMet and the properties of the AdoMet binding site, as well as the responsiveness of the enzyme to its allosteric regulator. The structure described herein paves the way for the rational design of compounds modulating hCBS activity and thus transsulfuration, redox status, and H2S biogenesis.

D-Arabinose 5-phosphate isomerases (APIs) catalyze the interconversion of D-ribulose 5-phosphate and D-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P). A5P is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (Kdo), an essential component of lipopolysaccharide, the lipopolysaccharide found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The genome of the Gram-positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes contains a gene encoding a putative sugar isomerase domain API, Q723E8, with significant similarity to c3406, the only one of four APIs from Escherichia coli CFT073 that lacks a cystathionine-ß-synthase domain. However, L. monocytogenes lacks genes encoding any of the other enzymes of the Kdo biosynthesis pathway. Realizing that the discovery of an API in a Gram-positive bacterium could provide insight into an alternate physiological role of A5P in the cell, we prepared and purified recombinant Q723E8. We found that Q723E8 does not possess API activity, but instead is a novel GPI (D-glucose 6-phosphate isomerase). However, the GPI activity of Q723E8 is weak compared with previously described GPIS. L. monocytogenes contains an ortholog of the well-studied two-domain bacterial GPI, so this maybe redundant. Based on this evidence glucose utilization is likely not the primary physiological role of Q723E8.

Recent studies suggest CNNM2 (cyclin M2) to be part of the long-sought basolateral Mg2+ extruder at the renal distal convoluted tubule, or its regulator. In the present study, we explore structural features and ligand-binding capacities of the Bateman module of CNNM2 (residues 429-584), an intracellular domain structurally equivalent to the region involved in Mg2+ handling by the bacterial Mg2+ transporter MgtE, and AMP binding by the Mg2+ efflux protein CorC. Additionally, we studied the structural impact of the pathogenic mutation T568I located in this region. Our crystal structures reveal that nucleotides such as AMP, ADP or ATP bind at only one of the two cavities present in CNNM2429-584. Mg2+ favours ATP binding by alleviating the otherwise negative charge repulsion existing between acidic residues and the polyphosphate group of ATP. In crystals CNNM2429-584 forms parallel dimers, commonly referred to as CBS (cystathionine ß-synthase) modules. Interestingly, nucleotide binding triggers a conformational change in the CBS module from a twisted towards a flat disc-like structure that mostly affects the structural elements connecting the Bateman module with the transmembrane region. We furthermore show that the T568I mutation, which causes dominant hypomagnesaemia, mimics the structural effect induced by nucleotide binding. The results of the present study suggest that the T568I mutation exerts its pathogenic effect in humans by constraining the conformational equilibrium of the CBS module of CNNM2, which becomes 'locked' in its flat form.

The B vitamins folic acid, vitamin B12 and B6 are essential for neuronal function, and severe deficiencies have been linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, psychiatric disease and dementia. Polymorphisms of genes involved in B vitamin absorption, metabolism and function, such as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), cystathionine ß synthase (CßS), transcobalamin 2 receptor (TCN2) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), have also been linked to increased incidence of psychiatric and cognitive disorders. However, the effects of these polymorphisms are often quite small and many studies failed to show any meaningful or consistent associations. This review discusses previous findings from clinical studies and highlights gaps in knowledge. Future studies assessing B vitamin-associated polymorphisms must take into account not just traditional demographics, but subjects' overall diet, relevant biomarkers of nutritional status and also analyze related genetic factors that may exacerbate behavioral effects or nutritional status.

BACKGROUND: Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) functions as a coenzyme in many cellular processes including one-carbon metabolism and the interconversion and catabolism of amino acids. PLP-dependent enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, function in transsulfuration but also have been implicated in the production of the endogenous gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concurrent with the formation of the biomarkers lanthionine and homolanthionine.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if H2S production and concurrent biomarker production is affected by vitamin B-6 restriction in a cell culture model.METHODS: We used cultured human hepatoma cells and evaluated static intracellular profiles of amino acids and in vivo kinetics of H2S biomarker formation. Cells were cultured for 6 wk in media containing concentrations of pyridoxal that represented severe vitamin B-6 deficiency (15 nmol/L pyridoxal), marginal deficiency (56 nmol/L pyridoxal), adequacy (210 nmol/L pyridoxal), and standard medium formulation providing a supraphysiologic pyridoxal concentration (1800 nmol/L pyridoxal).RESULTS: Intracellular concentrations of lanthionine and homolanthionine in cells cultured at 15 nmol/L pyridoxal were 50% lower (P &lt; 0.002) and 47% lower (P &lt; 0.0255), respectively, than observed in cells cultured at 1800 nmol/L pyridoxal. Extracellular homocysteine and cysteine were 58% and 46% higher, respectively, in severely deficient cells than in adequate cells (P &lt; 0.002). Fractional synthesis rates of lanthionine (P &lt; 0.01) and homolanthionine (P &lt; 0.006) were lower at 15 and 56 nmol/L pyridoxal than at both higher pyridoxal concentrations. The rate of homocysteine remethylation and the fractional rate of homocysteine production from methionine were not affected by vitamin B-6 restriction. In vitro studies of cell lysates using direct measurement of H2S also had a reduced extent of H2S production in the 2 lower vitamin B-6 conditions.CONCLUSION: In view of the physiologic roles of H2S, these results suggest a mechanism that may be involved in the association between human vitamin B-6 inadequacy and its effects on human health.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) functions as a physiological gas transmitter in both normal and pathophysiological cellular events. H2 S is produced from substances by three enzymes: cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). In human tissues, these enzymes are involved in tissue-specific biochemical pathways for H2 S production. For example, CBS and cysteine aminotransferase/MST are present in the brain, but CSE is not. Thus, we examined the expression of H2 S production-related enzymes in peripheral nerves. Here, we found that CSE and MST/cysteine aminotransferase, but not CBS, were present in normal peripheral nerves. In addition, injured sciatic nerves in vivo up-regulated CSE in Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration (WD); however, CSE was not up-regulated in peripheral axons. Using an ex vivo sciatic nerve explant culture, we found that the inhibition of H2 S production broadly prevented the process of nerve degeneration, including myelin fragmentation, axonal degradation, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, and Schwann cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Thus, these results indicate that H2 S signaling is essential for Schwann cell responses to peripheral nerve injury. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) functions as a physiological gas transmitter in both normal and pathophysiological cellular events. H2 S is produced from cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (MST). Here, we found that CSE and MST/CAT were present in normal peripheral nerves. Injured static nerves in vivo up-regulated CSE in Schwann cells during Wallerian degeneration, but CSE was not up-regulated in peripheral axons.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a key regulator of sulfur amino acid metabolism diverting homocysteine, a toxic intermediate of the methionine cycle, via the transsulfuration pathway to the biosynthesis of cysteine. Although the pathway itself is well conserved among eukaryotes, properties of eukaryotic CBS enzymes vary greatly. Here we present a side-by-side biochemical and biophysical comparison of human (hCBS), fruit fly (dCBS) and yeast (yCBS) enzymes. Preparation and characterization of the full-length and truncated enzymes, lacking the regulatory domains, suggested that eukaryotic CBS exists in one of at least two significantly different conformations impacting the enzyme's catalytic activity, oligomeric status and regulation. Truncation of hCBS and yCBS, but not dCBS, resulted in enzyme activation and formation of dimers compared to native tetramers. The dCBS and yCBS are not regulated by the allosteric activator of hCBS, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet); however, they have significantly higher specific activities in the canonical as well as alternative reactions compared to hCBS. Unlike yCBS, the heme-containing dCBS and hCBS showed increased thermal stability and retention of the enzyme's catalytic activity. The mass-spectrometry analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry showed clear presence and binding of AdoMet to yCBS and hCBS, but not dCBS. However, the role of AdoMet binding to yCBS remains unclear, unlike its role in hCBS. This study provides valuable information for understanding the complexity of the domain organization, catalytic specificity and regulation among eukaryotic CBS enzymes.

The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) T833C polymorphisms and primary hypertension. A case-control study was conducted by genotyping the representative variation in 545 hypertensive individuals (aged 49.23±7.56 years) and 500 normotensive individuals (aged 49.90±10.01 years). The T833C genetic polymorphisms of the CBS enzyme were detected in all subjects by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The CBS T833C polymorphism was successfully genotyped in the general population with a sample size of 1,045 (545+500) individuals. The genotypic and allelic frequency distributions of the CBS T833C polymorphism were not significantly different between the hypertensive and normotensive groups (P&gt;0.05). The CC genotype was significantly different (P&lt;0.05) from the CT and TT genotypes in terms of body mass index (BMI), and the levels of triglycerides (TG) and homocysteine (Hcy). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that BMI, total cholesterol (TC) level, smoking, plasma Hcy level and a family history of hypertension were the independent risk factors for hypertension in the population studied. The results indicate that the level of plasma Hcy was a risk factor for hypertension in the population studied. However, the mutation of the CBS T833C gene was not concluded to be an important hereditary factor for influencing the level of plasma Hcy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in erectile dysfunction (ED) induced by androgen deficiency.METHODS: We randomly divided 30 eight-week-old healthy male SD rats into six groups: 2-week control (A), 4-week control (B), 2-week castration (C), 4-week castration (D), 2-week castration + androgen replacement (E), and 4-week castration + androgen replacement (F), those in groups E and F subcutaneously injected with testosterone propionate (TP) at the physiological dose of 3 mg/kg per day after castration, while those in the other groups with isodose oil instead. At 2 and 4 weeks after operation, we determined the level of serum testosterone (T) , intracavernous pressure (ICP) , mean carotid arterial pressure (MAP) of the rats, measured the concentration of H2S in the plasma and corpus cavernosum tissue, and detected the expressions of cystathionine-P3-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.RESULTS: The serum T level was significantly lower in group C ([0.63 +/- 0.15] nmol/L) than in A ( [ 16.55 +/- 4.17] nmol/L) and E ( [ 18.99 +/- 4.62] nmol/L) (P &lt;0.05), as well as in group D ([0.70 +/-0.22] nmol/L) than in B ([15.44 +/-5.18] nmol/L) and F ([20.99 +/-6.41] nmol/L) (P &lt;0. 05) , and so were ICP/MAP after 5 and 7 V electrical stimulation of the pelvic ganglia (P &lt;0. 05) , H2 S concentration (P &lt;0.05), and the expressions of CBS and CSE (P &lt;0.05). The expressions of CBS and CSE proteins were also significantly decreased in group C as compared with D (P &lt;0.05).CONCLUSION: The reduced expressions of CBS and CSE may inhibit the H2 S signaling pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms underlying androgen deficiency-induced ED in rats.

Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid derived from the methionine metabolism, is located at the branch point of two pathways of the methionine cycle, i.e. remethylation and transsulfuration. Gene abnormalities in the enzymes catalyzing reactions in both pathways lead to hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk for congenital disorders, including neural tube closure defects, heart defects, cleft lip/palate, Down syndrome, and multi-system abnormalities in adults. Since hyperhomocysteinemia is known to affect the extent of DNA methylation, it is likely that abnormal DNA methylation during embryogenesis, may be a pathogenic factor for these congenital disorders. In this review we highlight the importance of homocysteinemia by describing the genes encoding for enzymes of homocysteine metabolism relevant to the clinical practice, especially cystathionine-ß-synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations, and the impairment of related metabolites levels. Moreover, a possible correlation between hyperhomocysteine and congenital disorders through the involvement of abnormal DNA methylation during embryogenesis is discussed. Finally, the relevance of present and future diagnostic tools such as tandem mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing in newborn screening is highlighted.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. Microglia can be activated and polarized to exert pro- or anti-inflammatory roles in response to specific stimulus. Rotenone is an environmental toxin that has been shown to activate microglia and neuroinflammation. However, the effects and mechanisms of rotenone on microglia polarization are poorly studied. In the present study, we demonstrated that rotenone enhanced the levels of M1 phenotypic genes including TNF-a, iNOS and COX-2/PGE2 but reduced that of M2 markers such as Ym1/2 and IL-10 in mouse primary and immortalized microglia. Moreover, the transcription and protein expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), as well as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production were decreased in rotenone-treated primary microglia. Elevating endogenous H2S via CBS over-expression in immortalized microglia not only reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory M1 genes, but also enhanced the anti-inflammatory M2 marker IL-10 production in response to rotenone stimulation as compared to vector-transfected cells. Similarly, pretreatment with H2S donor NaHS (50, 100 and 500µmol/L) attenuated the increases of M1 gene expression triggered by rotenone treatment, and enhanced the M2 gene Ym1/2 expression in mouse primary microglia. In addition, we observed reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine reversed the down-regulation of CBS and H2S generation caused by rotenone in microglia. NaHS pretreatment also decreased the ROS formation in rotenone-stimulated microglia. Taken together, these results reveal that probably via triggering ROS formation, rotenone suppressed the CBS-H2S pathway and thus promoted microglia polarization toward M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous mediator synthesized in mammalian tissues by three main enzymes-cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate-sulfurtransferase-and its levels increase under inflammatory conditions or sepsis. Since H2S and H2S-releasing molecules afford inhibitory properties in leukocyte trafficking, we tested whether endogenous annexin A1 (AnxA1), a glucocorticoid-regulated inhibitor of inflammation acting through formylated-peptide receptor 2 (ALX), could display intermediary functions in the anti-inflammatory profile of H2S. We first investigated whether endogenous AnxA1 could modulate H2S biosynthesis. To this end, a marked increase in CBS and/or CSE gene products was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in aortas, kidneys, and spleens collected from AnxA1(-/-) mice, as compared with wild-type animals. When lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages were studied, H2S-donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) counteracted the increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA evoked by the endotoxin, yet it was inactive in macrophages harvested from AnxA1(-/-) mice. Next we studied the effect of in vivo administration of NaHS in a model of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß)-induced mesenteric inflammation. AnxA1(+/+) mice treated with NaHS (100 µmol/kg) displayed inhibition of IL-1ß-induced leukocyte adhesion/emigration in the inflamed microcirculation, not observed in AnxA1(-/-) animals. These results were translated by testing human neutrophils, where NaHS (10-100 µM) prompted an intense mobilization (&gt;50%) of AnxA1 from cytosol to cell surface, an event associated with inhibition of cell/endothelium interaction under flow. Taken together, these data strongly indicate the existence of a positive interlink between AnxA1 and H2S pathway, with nonredundant functions in the control of experimental inflammation.

As one of three gasotransmitters, the fundamental signalling roles of hydrogen sulphide are receiving increasing attention. New tools for the accurate detection of hydrogen sulphide in cells and tissues are in demand to probe its biological functions. We report the p-nitrobenzyl-based ratiometric fluorescent probe RHP-2, which features a low detection limit, high selectivity and good photostability. The emission intensity ratios had a good linear relationship with the sulphide concentrations in PBS buffer and bovine serum. Our probe was applied to the ratiometric determination and imaging of endogenous H2S in living cells. Furthermore, RHP-2 was used as an effective tool to measure endogenous H2S in the mouse hippocampus. We observed a significant reduction in sulphide concentrations and downregulated expression of cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) mRNA and CBS protein in the mouse hippocampus in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression model. These data suggested that decreased concentrations of endogenous H2S may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic stress depression.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) results from increased hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis, and is closely linked to liver one-carbon (C1) metabolism. We assessed in C57BL6/N mice whether NAFLD induced by a high-fat (HF) diet over 8 weeks can be reversed by additional 4 weeks of a dietary methyl-donor supplementation (MDS). MDS in the obese mice failed to reverse NAFLD, but prevented the progression of hepatic steatosis associated with major changes in key hepatic C1-metabolites, e.g. S-adenosyl-methionine and S-adenosyl-homocysteine. Increased phosphorylation of AMPK-a together with enhanced ß-HAD activity suggested an increased flux through fatty acid oxidation pathways. This was supported by concomitantly decreased hepatic free fatty acid and acyl-carnitines levels. Although HF diet changed the hepatic phospholipid pattern, MDS did not. Our findings suggest that dietary methyl-donors activate AMPK, a key enzyme in fatty acid ß-oxidation control, that mediates increased fatty acid utilization and thereby prevents further hepatic lipid accumulation.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the formation of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine. CBS is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which binds to its C-terminal regulatory domain. Mutations in this domain lead to variants with high residual activity but lacking SAM activation. We characterized six C-terminal CBS variants (p.P427L, p.D444N, p.V449G, p.S500L, p.K523Sfs*18, and p.L540Q). To understand the effect of C-terminal mutations on the functional/structural properties of CBS, we performed dynamic light scattering, differential scanning fluorimetry, limited proteolysis, enzymatic characterization, and determination of SAM-binding affinity. Kinetic data confirm that the enzymatic function of these variants is not impaired. Although lacking SAM activation, the p.P427L and p.S500L were able to bind SAM at a lower extent than the wild type (WT), confirming that SAM binding and activation can be two independent events. At the structural level, the C-terminal variants presented various effects, either showing catalytic core instability and increased susceptibility toward aggregation or presenting with similar or higher stability than the WT. Our study highlights as the common feature to the C-terminal variants an impaired binding of SAM and no increase in enzymatic activity with physiological concentrations of the activator, suggesting the loss of regulation by SAM as a potential pathogenic mechanism.

AIM: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is endogenously produced and plays an important role as a modulator of neuronal functions; however, its modulatory role in the central CO2 chemoreception is unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of endogenously produced H2S in the ventilatory response to hypercapnia in adult conscious rats.METHODS: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) inhibitors (aminooxyacetate: AOA and propargylglycine: PAG respectively) and a H2S donor (sodium sulphide: Na2S) were microinjected into the fourth ventricle (4V). Ventilation (V<U+0307>(E)), oxygen consumption (V<U+0307>O2) and body temperature were recorded before (room air) and during a 30-min CO2 exposure (hypercapnia, 7% CO2). Endogenous H2S levels were measured in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS).RESULTS: Microinjection of Na2S (H2S donor), AOA (CBS inhibitor) or PAG (CSE inhibitor) did not affect baseline of the measured variables compared to control group (vehicle). In all experimental groups, hypercapnia elicited an increase in V<U+0307>(E). However, AOA microinjection, but not PAG, attenuated the ventilatory response to hypercapnia (P &lt; 0.05), whereas Na2S elicited a slight, not significant, enhancement. Moreover, endogenous H2S levels were found higher in the NTS after hypercapnia (P &lt; 0.05) compared to room air (normoxia) condition.CONCLUSION: There are a few reports on the role of gaseous transmitters in the control of breathing. Importantly, the present data suggest that endogenous H2S via the CBS-H2S pathway mediates the ventilatory response to hypercapnia playing an excitatory role.

Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is prevalent in humans and is implicated in neurovascular diseases, including recently in certain retinal diseases. Herein, we used hyperhomocysteinemic mice deficient in the Cbs gene encoding cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs(+/-)) to evaluate retinal vascular integrity. The Cbs(+/+) (wild type) and Cbs(+/-) (heterozygous) mice (aged 16 to 52 weeks) were subjected to fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography to assess vasculature in vivo. Retinas harvested for cryosectioning or flat mount preparations were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to detect blood vessels (isolectin-B4), angiogenesis [anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-CD105], gliosis [anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)], pericytes (anti-neural/glial antigen 2), blood-retinal barrier [anti-zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) and anti-occludin], and hypoxia [anti-pimonidazole hydrochloride (Hypoxyprobe-1)]. Levels of VEGF, GFAP, ZO-1, and occludin were determined by immunoblotting. Results of these analyses showed a mild vascular phenotype in young mice, which progressed with age. Fluorescein angiography revealed progressive neovascularization and vascular leakage in Cbs(+/-) mice; optical coherence tomography confirmed new vessels in the vitreous by 1 year. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated vascular patterns consistent with ischemia, including a capillary-free zone centrally and new vessels with capillary tufts midperipherally in older mice. This was associated with increased VEGF, CD105, and GFAP and decreased ZO-1/occludin levels in the Cbs(+/-) retinas. Retinal vein occlusion was observed in some Cbs(+/-) mouse retinas. We conclude that mild to moderate elevation of homocysteine in Cbs(+/-) mice is accompanied by progressive alterations in retinal vasculature characterized by ischemia, neovascularization, incompetent blood-retinal barrier, and vascular occlusion.

Exposure to ozone has been associated with airway inflammation, oxidative stress, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The goal of this study was to examine whether these adverse effects of ozone could be prevented or reversed by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a reducing agent. The H2S donor sodium (NaHS) (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was intraperitoneally injected into mice 1 hour before and after 3-hour ozone (2.5 ppm) or air exposure, and the mice were studied 24 hours later. Preventive and therapeutic treatment with NaHS reduced the ozone-induced increases in the total cells, including neutrophils and macrophages; this treatment also reduced levels of cytokines, including TNF-a, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, IL-6, and IL-1ß levels in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid; inhibited bronchial hyperresponsiveness; and attenuated ozone-induced increases in total malondialdehyde in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decreases in the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione in the lung. Ozone exposure led to decreases in the H2S production rate and in mRNA and protein levels of cystathionine-ß-synthetase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase in the lung. These effects were prevented and reversed by NaHS treatment. Furthermore, NaHS prevented and reversed the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and heat shock protein 27. H2S may have preventive and therapeutic value in the treatment of airway diseases that have an oxidative stress basis.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with increased diabetic cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of HHcy in atherogenesis associated with hyperglycemia (HG) remains unknown. To examine the role and mechanisms by which HHcy accelerates HG-induced atherosclerosis, we established an atherosclerosis-susceptible HHcy and HG mouse model. HHcy was established in mice deficient in cystathionine ß-synthase (Cbs) in which the homocysteine (Hcy) level could be lowered by inducing transgenic human CBS (Tg-hCBS) using Zn supplementation. HG was induced by streptozotocin injection. Atherosclerosis was induced by crossing Tg-hCBS Cbs mice with apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice and feeding them a high-fat diet for 2 weeks. We demonstrated that HHcy and HG accelerated atherosclerosis and increased lesion monocytes (MCs) and macrophages (MØs) and further increased inflammatory MC and MØ levels in peripheral tissues. Furthermore, Hcy-lowering reversed circulating mononuclear cells, MC, and inflammatory MC and MC-derived MØ levels. In addition, inflammatory MC correlated positively with plasma Hcy levels and negatively with plasma s-adenosylmethionine-to-s-adenosylhomocysteine ratios. Finally, l-Hcy and d-glucose promoted inflammatory MC differentiation in primary mouse splenocytes, which was reversed by adenoviral DNA methyltransferase-1. HHcy and HG, individually and synergistically, accelerated atherosclerosis and inflammatory MC and MØ differentiation, at least in part, via DNA hypomethylation.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is considered to be a signaling molecule. The precise mechanisms underlying H2S-related events, including the producing enzymes and target molecules in gastrointestinal tissues, have not been elucidated in detail. We herein examined the involvement of H2S in contractions induced by repeated electrical stimulations (ES). ES-induced contractions were neurotoxin-sensitive and increased by aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, but not by D,L-propargylglycine, a selective inhibitor of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, in an ES trial-dependent manner. ES-induced contractions were markedly decreased in the presence of L-cysteine. This response was inhibited by aminooxyacetic acid and an antioxidant, and accelerated by L-methionine, an activator of CBS. The existence of CBS was confirmed. NaHS transiently inhibited ES- and acetylcholine-induced contractions, and sustainably decreased basal tone for at least 20 min after its addition. The treatment with glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, reduced both the L-cysteine response and NaHS-induced inhibition of contractions. The NaHS-induced decrease in basal tone was inhibited by apamin, a small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker. These results suggest that H2S may be endogenously produced via CBS in ES-activated enteric neurons, and regulates contractility via multiple K+ channels in the ileum.

High level of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia, HHcy) is associated with increased risk for vascular disease. Evidence for this emerges from epidemiological studies which show that HHcy is associated with premature peripheral, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease independent of other risk factors. Possible mechanisms by which homocysteine causes vascular injury include endothelial injury, DNA dysfunction, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, increased oxidative stress, reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase and promoting inflammation. HHcy has been shown to cause direct damage to endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, this manifests as impaired flow-mediated vasodilation and is mainly due to a reduction in nitric oxide synthesis and bioavailability. The effect of impaired nitric oxide release can in turn trigger and potentiate atherothrombogenesis and oxidative stress. Endothelial damage is a crucial aspect of atherosclerosis and precedes overt manifestation of disease. In addition, endothelial dysfunction is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, ischemia reperfusion injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Homocysteine is a precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is formed by transulfuration process catalyzed by the enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. H2S is a gasotransmitter that has emerged recently as a novel mediator in cardiovascular homeostasis. As a potent vasodilator, it plays several roles which include regulation of vessel diameter, protection of endothelium from redox stress, ischemia reperfusion injury and chronic inflammation. However, the precise mechanism by which it mediates these beneficial effects is complex and still remains unclear. Current evidence indicates H2S modulates cellular functions by a variety of intracellular signaling processes. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of HHcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and the metabolism and physiological functions of H2S as a protective agent.

This study investigated the neuroprotection and potential mechanism of carbon monoxide (CO) against perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in rats by electrical acupuncture (EA). Animal behavior, morphological changes, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression levels, and CO content in rat cortex cells were determined. Results demonstrated that EA treatment decreased the slope behavior and increased the overhang behavior of perinatal rats. The treatment also decreased the number of positive cells. The activator and inhibitor of CBS aggravated and remitted the hypoxic damage in cortex cells, respectively. EA treatment decreased CBS expression level and increased HO-1 and HIF-1a expression levels in perinatal rat cortex cells. Compared with the control groups, the CO content of cortex cells in the EA treatment group significantly increased (**p &lt; 0.01). We hypothesized that EA treatment increases cortical CO content to protect against hypoxic damage via the hydrogen sulfide/CBS-CO/HO-1-HIF-1a system. This study provided a significant reference for EA therapy and cued a novel protective mechanism for cerebral palsy.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes metabolic reactions that convert homocysteine to cystathionine. To assess the role of CBS in human glioma, cells were stably transfected with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA targeting CBS or a nontargeting control shRNA, and subclones were injected into immunodeficient mice. Interestingly, decreased CBS expression did not affect proliferation in vitro but decreased the latency period before rapid tumor xenograft growth after subcutaneous injection and increased tumor incidence and volume following orthotopic implantation into the caudate-putamen. In soft-agar colony formation assays, CBS knockdown subclones displayed increased anchorage-independent growth. Molecular analysis revealed that CBS knockdown subclones expressed higher basal levels of the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 2a (HIF2a/EPAS1). HIF2a knockdown counteracted the effect of CBS knockdown on anchorage-independent growth. Bioinformatic analysis of mRNA expression data from human glioma specimens revealed a significant association between low expression of CBS mRNA and high expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and VEGF transcripts, which are HIF2 target gene products that were also increased in CBS knockdown subclones. These results suggest that decreased CBS expression in glioma increases HIF2a protein levels and HIF2 target gene expression, which promotes glioma tumor formation.</AbstractText>: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes metabolic reactions that convert homocysteine to cystathionine.

Regulated family II pyrophosphatases (CBS-PPases) contain a nucleotide-binding insert comprising a pair of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains, termed a Bateman module. By binding with high affinity to the CBS domains, AMP and ADP usually inhibit the enzyme, whereas ATP activates it. Here, we demonstrate that AMP, ADP, and ATP bind in a positively cooperative manner to CBS-PPases from four bacteria: Desulfitobacterium hafniense, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium perfringens, and Eggerthella lenta. Enzyme interaction with substrate as characterized by the Michaelis constant (Km) also exhibited positive catalytic cooperativity that decreased in magnitude upon nucleotide binding. The degree of both types of cooperativity increased with increasing concentration of the cofactor Mg(2+) except for the C. novyi PPase where Mg(2+) produced the opposite effect on kinetic cooperativity. Further exceptions from these general rules were ADP binding to C. novyi PPase and AMP binding to E. lenta PPase, neither of which had any effect on activity. A genetically engineered deletion variant of D. hafniense PPase lacking the regulatory insert was fully active but differed from the wild-type enzyme in that it was insensitive to nucleotides and bound substrate non-cooperatively and with a smaller Km value. These results indicate that the regulatory insert acts as an internal inhibitor and confers dual positive cooperativity to CBS domain-containing PPases, making them highly sensitive regulators of the PPi level in response to the changes in cell energy status that control adenine nucleotide distribution. These regulatory features may be common among other CBS domain-containing proteins.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO), two endogenous gaseous molecules in endothelial cells, got increased attention with respect to their protective roles in the cardiovascular system. However, the details of the signaling pathways between H2S and NO in endothelia cells remain unclear. In this study, a treatment with NaHS profoundly increased the expression and the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Elevated gaseous NO levels were observed by a novel and specific fluorescent probe, 5-amino-2-(6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9-yl)benzoic acid methyl ester (FA-OMe), and quantified by flow cytometry. Further study indicated an increase of upstream regulator for eNOS activation, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (Akt). By using a biotin switch, the level of NO-mediated protein S-nitrosylation was also enhanced. However, with the addition of the NO donor, NOC-18, the expressions of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine-ß-synthase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase were not changed. The level of H2S was also monitored by a new designed fluorescent probe, 4-nitro-7-thiocyanatobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-SCN) with high specificity. Therefore, NO did not reciprocally increase the expression of H2S-generating enzymes and the H2S level. The present study provides an integrated insight of cellular responses to H2S and NO from protein expression to gaseous molecule generation, which indicates the upstream role of H2S in modulating NO production and protein S-nitrosylation.



#### Endogenous hydrogen sulfide in the rostral ventrolateral medulla/Bötzinger complex downregulates ventilatory responses to hypoxia.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is now recognized as a new gaseous transmitter involved in several brain-mediated responses. The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM)/Bötzinger complex is a region in the brainstem that is involved in cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Recently, it has been shown that exogenous H2S in the RVLM modulates autonomic function and thus blood pressure. In the present study, we investigated whether H2S, endogenously produced in the RVLM/Bötzinger complex, plays a role in the control of hypoxia-induced hyperventilation. Ventilation (VE) was measured before and after bilateral microinjection of Na2S (H2S donor, 0.04, 1 and 2 pmol/100 nl) or aminooxyacetate (AOA, 0.2, 1 and 2 pmol/100 nl, a cystathionine ß-synthase, CBS, inhibitor) into the RVLM/Bötzinger complex followed by a 60-min period of hypoxia (7% inspired O2) or normoxia exposure. Control rats received microinjection of vehicle. Microinjection of vehicle, AOA or Na2S did not change VE in normoxic conditions. Exposure to hypoxia evoked a typical increase in VE. Microinjection of Na2S (2 pmol) followed by hypoxia exposure attenuated the hyperventilation. Conversely, microinjection of AOA (2 pmol) into the RVLM/Bötzinger complex caused an increase in the hypoxia-induced hyperventilation. Thus, endogenous H2S in the RVLM/Bötzinger complex seems to play no role in the maintenance of basal pulmonary ventilation during normoxia whereas during hypoxia H2S has a downmodulatory function. Homogenates of RVLM/Bötzinger complex of animals previously exposed to hypoxia for 60 min exhibited a decreased rate of H2S production. Our data are consistent with the notion that the gaseous messenger H2S synthesis is downregulated in the RVLM/Bötzinger complex during hypoxia favoring hyperventilation.

The present study investigated the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating Na(+) uptake in larval zebrafish, Danio rerio. Waterborne treatment of larvae at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) with Na2S or GYY-4137 (chemicals known to generate H2S) significantly reduced Na(+) uptake. Exposure of larvae to water enriched with NaCl (1 mM NaCl) caused a pronounced reduction in Na(+) uptake which was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), two key enzymes involved in the endogenous synthesis of H2S. Furthermore, translational gene knockdown of CSE and CBSb significantly increased the basal rate of Na(+) uptake. Waterborne treatment with Na2S significantly decreased whole-body acid excretion and reduced Na(+) uptake in larval zebrafish preexposed to acidic (pH 4.0) water (a condition shown to promote Na(+) uptake via Na(+)-H(+)-exchanger 3b, NHE3b). However, Na2S did not affect Na(+) uptake in larvae depleted of NHE3b-containing ionocytes (HR cells) after knockdown of transcription factor glial cell missing 2 (gcm2) in which Na(+) uptake occurs predominantly via Na(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter (NCC)-containing cells. These observations suggest that Na(+) uptake via NHE3b, but not NCC, is regulated by H2S. Whole-mount immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ionocytes expressing NHE3b also express CSE. These data suggests a physiologically relevant role of H2S as a mechanism to lower Na(+) uptake in zebrafish larvae, probably through its inhibitory action on NHE3b.

Polysaccharides isolated from edible Dendrobium huoshanense have been shown to possess a hepatoprotection function for selenium- and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of daily supplementation with an homogeneous polysaccharide (DHP) purified from D. huoshanense on ethanol-induced subacute liver injury in mice and its potential mechanisms in liver protection by a proteomic approach. DHP was found to effectively depress the increased ratio of liver weight to body weight, reduce the elevated levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, total bilirubin and low density lipoprotein, and alleviate hepatic steatosis in mice with ethanol-induced subacute liver injury. Hepatic proteomics analysis performed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS) revealed that cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs) and D-lactate dehydrogenase (Ldhd) were two key proteins regulated by daily DHP intervention, which may assist in correcting the abnormal hepatic methionine metabolism pathway and decreasing the level of hepatic methylglyoxal generated from disordered metabolic pathways caused by ethanol. Our data suggest that DHP can protect liver function from alcoholic injury with complicated molecular mechanisms involving regulation of Cbs and Ldhd.

The variation in the coding capacity within Oenococcus oeni can have a significant impact on wine quality. The detection of several genes involved in important metabolic pathways (i.e. citrate, sulphur and arginine metabolisms) was performed on 10 indigenous O. oeni strains from Negroamaro wine, a red table wine (Apulia, Italy). These strains were selected from 95 isolates, collected during spontaneous malolactic fermentation, according to the results of an Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. A total of 16 genes were screened, most (11) of which had never previously been assayed on O. oeni. All strains possessed 10 genes encoding enzymes such as malolactic enzyme (mleA), esterase (estA), citrate lyase (citD, citE and citF), citrate transporter (maeP), a-acetolactate decarboxylase (alsD), a- acetolactate synthase (alsS), S-adenosylmethionine synthase (metK) and cystathionine ß-lyase (metC) and resulted negative in the detection of genes encoding cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (metB), ornithine transcarbamylase (arcB) and carbamate kinase (arcC). The sequence of PCR fragments of 11 genes of a representative strain (ITEM 15929) was compared to those of three reference O. oeni strains. The indigenous strain was phylogenetically more similar to PSU-1 and ATCC BAA1163 than AWRI B429. This study describes new genetic markers useful for detecting the genetic potential of O. oeni strains to contribute to aroma production and for investigating the population structure of the species.

Selenium is an essential trace element and mediates its functions via various selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases or thioredoxin reductases. A suboptimal selenium supply causes metabolic disturbances and is associated with an increased risk to develop different disorders, including cancer or cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to assess the impact of a suboptimal selenium status on the hepatic metabolome of male mice analyzed by a targeted liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and a method based on non-targeted gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry. Feeding animals a diet with about half of the recommended selenium content supplied as selenomethionine caused liver glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase activities to decline and lipid peroxidation to increase. Serum T3 thyroid hormone concentration also declined via a reduced hepatic deiodinase activity. Metabolite profiling revealed predominantly changes in cysteine and carbon-1 metabolism as well as in selected lipid subclasses. In particular the concentrations of palmitoylcarnitines and oleoylcarnitines (C18:1 and C16:1) and various phosphatidylcholine species containing saturated fatty acids were elevated. Increased taurine levels suggested an enhanced cysteine flux through the salvage pathway whereas increased homocysteine levels appeared to be a consequence of a massive down-regulation of cystathionine ß lyase (cystathionine ß synthase) and a reduced flux through the transsulfuration pathway. The findings demonstrate that a suboptimal selenium status causes alterations in lipid and carbon-1 metabolism in mouse liver. These changes may contribute to the development of diseases associated with a suboptimal selenium status.

Embryo retention in the fallopian tube is thought to lead to ectopic pregnancy, which is a significant cause of morbidity. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a gaseotransmitter produced mainly by cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase and cystathionine-ß-synthase. Here we show that cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase and cystathionine -ß-synthase are ubiquitously distributed in human fallopian tube epithelium and that H2S signalling relaxes the spontaneous contraction of the human oviduct. Furthermore, an aberration in H2S signalling, either silenced or enhanced activity induced by pharmacologic or genetic methods, causes embryo retention and developmental delay in the mouse oviduct, which is partly reversed by administration of either GYY4137, a slow-releasing H2S donor, or NaHS. Our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism for oviductal embryo transport.

This study investigated the role and mechanism of Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) on vascular remodeling in mice. We assessed the effect of HHcy on vascular remodeling using a carotid arterial vein patch model in mice with the gene deletion of cystathionine-beta-synthase (Cbs). Vein grafts were harvested 4 weeks after surgery. Cross sections were analyzed using Verhoeff-van Gieson staining, Masson`s Trichrome staining, and immunostaining for morphological analysis and protein level assessment. The effect of Hcy on collagen secretion was examined in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). We found that Cbs-/- mice with severe HHcy exhibited thicker neointima and a higher percentage of luminal narrowing in vein grafts. In addition, severe HHcy increased elastin and collagen deposition in the neointima. Further, severe HHcy increases CD45 positive cells and proliferative cells in vein grafts. Finally, Hcy increases collagen secretion in RASMC. These results demonstrate that HHcy increases neointima formation, elastin and collagen deposition following a carotid arterial vein patch. The capacity of Hcy to promote vascular fibrosis and inflammation may contribute to the development of vascular remodeling.

AIMS: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the two-step trans-sulfuration pathway that converts homocysteine to cysteine. It is also one of three major enzymes responsible for the biogenesis of H2S, a signaling molecule. We have previously demonstrated that CBS is activated in cells challenged by oxidative stress, but the underlying molecular mechanism of this regulation has remained unclear.RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that S-glutathionylation of CBS enhances its activity ~2-fold in vitro. Loss of this post-translational modification in the presence of dithiothreitol results in reversal to basal activity. Cys346 was identified as the site for S-glutathionylation by a combination of mass spectrometric, mutagenesis, and activity analyses. To test the physiological relevance of S-glutathionylation-dependent regulation of CBS, HEK293 cells were oxidatively challenged with peroxide, which is known to enhance the trans-sulfuration flux. Under these conditions, CBS glutathionylation levels increased and were correlated with a ~3-fold increase in CBS activity.INNOVATION: Collectively, our results reveal a novel post-translational modification of CBS, that is, glutathionylation, which functions as an allosteric activator under oxidative stress conditions permitting enhanced synthesis of both cysteine and H2S.CONCLUSIONS: Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism for increased cysteine and therefore glutathione, synthesis via glutathionylation of CBS. They also demonstrate the potential for increased H2S production under oxidative stress conditions, particularly in tissues where CBS is a major source of H2S.

Cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient homocystinuria (HCU) is a serious life-threatening inborn error of sulfur metabolism with poorly understood pathogenic mechanisms. We investigated the effect of HCU on hepatic cysteine oxidation in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) protein levels were 90% repressed without any change in mRNA levels. Cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) was induced at both the mRNA (8-fold) and protein (15-fold) levels. Cysteine supplementation normalized CDO protein levels without reversing the induction of CSAD. Regulatory changes in CDO and CSAD expression were proportional to homocysteine elevation, indicating a possible threshold effect. Hepatic and blood taurine levels in HCU animals were decreased by 21 and 35%, respectively, and normalized by cysteine supplementation. Expression of the cytoplasmic (GOT1) and mitochondrial (GOT2) isoforms of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase were repressed in HCU animals by 86 and 30%, respectively. HCU induced regulatory changes in CSAD, CDO, and GOT1 expression were normalized by taurine supplementation, indicating that cysteine is not the only sulfur compound that regulates hepatic cysteine oxidation. Collectively, our results indicate that HCU induces significant alterations of sulfur metabolism with the potential to contribute to pathogenesis and that cysteine and taurine have the potential to serve as adjunctive treatments in this disease.

Arabinose-5-phosphate isomerases (APIs) catalyze the interconversion of d-ribulose-5-phosphate and D-arabinose-5-phosphate, the first step in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo), an essential component of the lipopolysaccharide in Gram-negative bacteria. Classical APIs, such as Escherichia coli KdsD, contain a sugar isomerase domain and a tandem cystathionine beta-synthase domain. Despite substantial effort, little is known about structure-function relationships in these APIs. We recently reported an API containing only a sugar isomerase domain. This protein, c3406 from E. coli CFT073, has no known physiological function. In this study, we investigated a putative single-domain API from the anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium Bacteroides fragilis. This putative API (UniProt ID Q5LIW1) is the only protein encoded by the B. fragilis genome with significant identity to any known API, suggesting that it is responsible for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in B. fragilis. We tested this hypothesis by preparing recombinant Q5LIW1 protein (here referred to by the UniProt ID Q5LIW1), characterizing its API activity in vitro, and demonstrating that the gene encoding Q5LIW1 (GenBank ID YP_209877.1) was able to complement an API-deficient E. coli strain. We demonstrated that Q5LIW1 is inhibited by cytidine 5'-monophospho-3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid, the final product of the Kdo biosynthesis pathway, with a Ki of 1.91 µM. These results support the assertion that Q5LIW1 is the API that supports lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in B. fragilis and is subject to feedback regulation by CMP-Kdo. The sugar isomerase domain of E. coli KdsD, lacking the two cystathionine beta-synthase domains, demonstrated API activity and was further characterized. These results suggest that Q5LIW1 may be a suitable system to study API structure-function relationships.

A naphthalimide-azide based colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent probe, NAP-1, has been developed for the selective and sensitive detection of hydrogen sulphide. Advantages of the probe NAP-1 include a low detection limit (110 nM), good selectivity, high sensitivity and excellent photostability. A linear relationship between the emission intensity ratios and sulphide concentrations was observed in PBS buffer and bovine serum, respectively. Our probe facilitates ratiometric determination and imaging of endogenous H2S in living cells. Furthermore, this probe was successfully applied to the measurement of endogenous sulphide in human plasma and mouse hippocampus. A significant reduction in sulphide levels and CBS mRNA expression was observed in the hippocampus of mouse models of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation-related diseases, suggesting that decreased levels of endogenous H2S might be involved in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with cognitive decline and hearing loss due to vascular dysfunction. Although we have shown that HHcy-induced increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is associated with cochlear pathology in cystathionine-ß-synthase heterozygous (CBS(+/-)) mice, it is still unclear whether MMP-9 contributes to functional deficit in cognition and hearing. Therefore, we hypothesize that HHcy-induced MMP-9 activation causes vascular, cerebral and cochlear remodeling resulting in diminished cognition and hearing. Wildtype (WT), CBS(+/-), MMP-9(-/-) and CBS(+/-)/MMP-9(-/-) double knock-out (DKO) mice were genotyped and used. Doppler flowmetry of internal carotid artery (ICA) was performed for peak systolic velocity [PSV], pulsatility index [PI] and resistive index [RI]. Cognitive functions were assessed by Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) and for cochlear function Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was elicited. Peak systolic velocity, pulsatility and resistive indices of ICA were decreased in CBS(+/-) mice, indicating reduced perfusion. ABR threshold was increased and maximum ABR amplitude and NORT indices (recognition, discrimination) were decreased in CBS(+/-) mice compared to WT and MMP-9(-/-). All these parameters were attenuated in DKO mice suggesting a significant role of MMP-9 in HHcy-induced vascular, neural and cochlear pathophysiology. Regression analysis of PSV with ABR and cognitive parameters revealed significant correlation (0.44-0.58). For the first time, MMP-9 has been correlated directly to functional deficits of brain and cochlea, and found to have a significant role. Our data suggests a dual pathology of HHcy occurring due to a decrease in blood supply (vasculo-neural and vasculo-cochlear) and direct tissue remodeling.

Arsenic is an environmental pollutant, and its liver toxicity has long been recognized. The effect of arsenic on liver protein expression was analyzed using a proteomic approach in monkeys. Monkeys were orally administered sodium arsenite (SA) for 28 days. As shown by 2D-PAGE in combination with MS, the expression levels of 16 proteins were quantitatively changed in SA-treated monkey livers compared to control-treated monkey livers. Specifically, the levels of two proteins, mortalin and tubulin beta chain, were increased, and 14 were decreased, including plastin-3, cystathionine-beta-synthase, selenium-binding protein 1, annexin A6, alpha-enolase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-M, erlin-2, and arginase-1. In view of their functional roles, differential expression of these proteins may contribute to arsenic-induced liver toxicity, including cell death and carcinogenesis. Among the 16 identified proteins, four were selected for validation by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Additional Western blot analyses indicated arsenic-induced dysregulation of oxidative stress related, genotoxicity-related, and glucose metabolism related proteins in livers from SA-treated animals. Many changes in the abundance of toxicity-related proteins were also demonstrated in SA-treated human hepatoma cells. These data on the arsenic-induced regulation of proteins with critical roles may help elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced liver toxicity.

Increased blood level of homocysteine (Hcy), called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) accompanies many cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that HHcy-enhanced cerebrovascular permeability occurs via activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and leads to an increased formation of fibrinogen-ß-amyloid (Fg-Aß) complex. Cerebrovascular permeability changes were assessed in C57BL/6J (wild type, WT), cystathionine-ß-synthase heterozygote (Cbs+/-, a genetic model of HHcy), MMP9 gene knockout (Mmp9-/-), and Cbs and Mmp9 double knockout (Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/-) mice using a dual-tracer probing method. Expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and Fg-Aß complex formation was assessed in mouse brain cryosections by immunohistochemistry. Short-term memory of mice was assessed with a novel object recognition test. The cerebrovascular permeability in Cbs+/- mice was increased via mainly the paracellular transport pathway. VE-cadherin expression was the lowest and Fg-Aß complex formation was the highest along with the diminished short-term memory in Cbs+/- mice. These effects of HHcy were ameliorated in Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/- mice. Thus, HHcy causes activation of MMP9 increasing cerebrovascular permeability by downregulation of VE-cadherin resulting in an enhanced formation of Fg-Aß complex that can be associated with loss of memory. These data may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention that can modulate HHcy-induced cerebrovascular permeability and resultant pathologies.

Hyperhomocysteinemia resulting from cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency can produce cognitive dysfunction. We recently found that CBS-deficient mice exhibit increased expression of the serine/threonine kinase dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) in the brain. When dysregulated, DYRK1A contributes to the neurodegeneration, neuronal death, and loss of function observed in neurodegenerative diseases. However, brain plasticity can be improved by interventions like enriched environment combined with voluntary exercise (EE/VE). The present study sought to assess the effects of EE/VE on molecular mechanisms linked to DYRK1A overexpression in the brain of CBS-deficient mice. EE/VE was applied to 3-month-old female CBS-deficient mice for 1 month. Without intervention, CBS-deficient mice exhibited increased DYRK1A and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the cortex and hippocampus. However, EE/VE rescued these altered DYRK1A and BDNF levels in the hippocampus of CBS-deficient mice. We conclude that exercise combined with enriched environment can restore the altered molecular mechanisms in the brain of CBS-deficient mice.

INTRODUCTION: Classical homocystinuria is a rare genetic disease caused by cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency, resulting in homocysteine accumulation. Growing evidence suggests that reduced fat mass in patients with classical homocystinuria may be associated with alterations in choline and homocysteine pathways. This study aimed to evaluate the body composition of patients with classical homocystinuria, identifying changes in body fat percentage and correlating findings with biochemical markers of homocysteine and choline pathways, lipoprotein levels and bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores.METHODS: Nine patients with classical homocystinuria were included in the study. Levels of homocysteine, methionine, cysteine, choline, betaine, dimethylglycine and ethanolamine were determined. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in patients and in 18 controls. Data on the last BMD measurement and lipoprotein profile were obtained from medical records.RESULTS: Of 9 patients, 4 (44%) had a low body fat percentage, but no statistically significant differences were found between patients and controls. Homocysteine and methionine levels were negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI), while cysteine showed a positive correlation with BMI (p&lt;0.05). There was a trend between total choline levels and body fat percentage (r=0.439, p=0.07). HDL cholesterol correlated with choline and ethanolamine levels (r=0.757, p=0.049; r=0.847, p=0.016, respectively), and total cholesterol also correlated with choline levels (r=0.775, p=0.041). There was no association between BMD T-scores and body composition.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that reduced fat mass is common in patients with classical homocystinuria, and that alterations in homocysteine and choline pathways affect body mass and lipid metabolism.

Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is maintained by the cross-talk of endothelial cells, junction proteins, and neurogliovascular network, the epigenetic mechanisms behind BBB permeability are largely unknown. We are reporting for the first time miR29b-mediated regulation of BBB, which is a novel mechanism underlying BBB integrity. We hypothesize that miR29b regulates BBB dysfunction by regulating DNMT3b, which consequently regulates the levels of metalloproteinases, that can eat up the membrane and junction proteins leading to leaky vasculature. In addition, 5'-azacytidine (5'-aza) was used to test its efficacy on BBB permeability. Blood-brain barrier disruption model was created by using homocysteine, and in the models miR29b was identified to be most affected, by using microRNA RT(2)-qPCR array. MiR29b mimics and inhibitors also confirmed that miR29b regulates the levels DNMT3b and MMP9. In hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine-ß-synthase deficient (CBS(+/-)) mice with high brain vessel permeability, miR29b levels were also high as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, 5'-aza improved BBB permeability by decreasing the expression of miR29b. In conclusion, our data suggested miR29b-mediated regulation of BBB dysfunction through DNMT3b and MMP9. It also potentiates the use of microRNAs as candidates for future epigenetic therapies in the improvement of BBB integrity.

SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as a signaling molecule as well as a cytoprotectant. It modulates neurotransmission, regulates vascular tone, and protects various tissues and organs, including neurons, the heart, and kidneys, from oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion injury. H2S is produced from l-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase.RECENT ADVANCES: In addition to these enzymes, we recently identified a novel pathway to produce H2S from d-cysteine, which involves d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) along with 3MST. These enzymes are localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. However, some enzymes translocate to organelles under specific conditions. Moreover, H2S-derived potential signaling molecules such as polysulfides and HSNO have been identified.CRITICAL ISSUES: The physiological stimulations, which trigger the production of H2S and its derivatives and maintain their local levels, remain unclear.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Understanding the regulation of the H2S production and H2S-derived signaling molecules and the specific stimuli that induce their release will provide new insights into the biology of H2S and therapeutic development in diseases involving these substances.

Homocystinuria is a neurometabolic disease caused by severe deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase activity, resulting in severe hyperhomocysteinemia. Affected patients present several symptoms including a variable degree of motor dysfunction, being that the pathomechanism is not fully understood. In the present study we investigated the effect of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia on some parameters of oxidative stress, namely 2'7'dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation, levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT and GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), total sulfhydryl and carbonyl content, as well as nitrite levels in soleus skeletal muscle of young rats subjected to model of severe hyperhomocysteinemia. We also evaluated the effect of creatine on biochemical alterations elicited by hyperhomocysteinemia. Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous injection of homocysteine (0.3-0.6 µmol/g body weight), and/or creatine (50mg/kg body weight) from their 6th to the 28th days age. Controls and treated rats were decapitated at 12h after the last injection. Chronic homocysteine administration increased 2'7'dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation, an index of production of reactive species and TBARS levels, an index of lipoperoxidation. Antioxidant enzyme activities, such as SOD and CAT were also increased, but GPx activity was not altered. The content of GSH, sulfhydril and carbonyl were decreased, as well as levels of nitrite. Creatine concurrent administration prevented some homocysteine effects probably by its antioxidant properties. Our data suggest that the oxidative insult elicited by chronic hyperhomocystenemia may provide insights into the mechanisms by which homocysteine exerts its effects on skeletal muscle function. Creatine prevents some alterations caused by homocysteine.

Indigenous oral bacteria in the tongue coating such as Veillonella have been identified as the main producers of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the major components of oral malodor. However, there is little information on the physiological properties of H2S production by oral Veillonella such as metabolic activity and oral environmental factors which may affect H2S production. Thus, in the present study, the H2S-producing activity of growing cells, resting cells, and cell extracts of oral Veillonella species and the effects of oral environmental factors, including pH and lactate, were investigated. Type strains of Veillonella atypica, Veillonella dispar, and Veillonella parvula were used. These Veillonella species produced H2S during growth in the presence of l-cysteine. Resting cells of these bacteria produced H2S from l-cysteine, and the cell extracts showed enzymatic activity to convert l-cysteine to H2S. H2S production by resting cells was higher at pH 6 to 7 and lower at pH 5. The presence of lactate markedly increased H2S production by resting cells (4.5- to 23.7-fold), while lactate had no effect on enzymatic activity in cell extracts. In addition to H2S, ammonia was produced in cell extracts of all the strains, indicating that H2S was produced by the catalysis of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1). Serine was also produced in cell extracts of V. atypica and V. parvula, suggesting the involvement of cystathionine ß-synthase lyase (EC 4.2.1.22) in these strains. This study indicates that Veillonella produce H2S from l-cysteine and that their H2S production can be regulated by oral environmental factors, namely, pH and lactate.

Mangiferin has been extensively applied in different fields due to its anti-inflammatory properties. However, the precise mechanism used by mangiferin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation has not been elucidated. Here, we discuss the potential mechanism of mangiferin during a LPS-induced brain injury. Brain injury was induced in ICR mice via intraperitoneal LPS injection (5 mg/kg). Open- and closed-field tests were used to detect the behaviors of mice, while immunoblotting was performed to measure the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cystathionine-b-synthase (CBS) in the hippocampus after mangiferin was orally administered (p.o.). Mangiferin relieved LPS-induced sickness 6 and 24 h after LPS injection; in addition, this compound suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production after 24 h of LPS induction as well as the downregulation of LPS-induced CBS expression after 6 and 24 h of LPS treatment in the hippocampus. Therefore, mangiferin attenuated sickness behavior by regulating the expression of IL-6 and CBS.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have shown that phytoestrogen a-zearalanol can protect cardiovascular system from hyperhomocysteinemia and ameliorate the level of plasma total homocysteine; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. The aim of this research is to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in ameliorating the level of plasma homocysteine by a-zearalanol. By the successfully established diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia rat models, we found that, after a-zearalanol treatment, the activity of cystathionine ß-synthase, the key enzyme in homocysteine metabolism, was significantly elevated and level of nitrative stress in liver was significantly reduced. In correlation with this, results also showed a decreased nitration level of cystathionine ß-synthase in liver. Together data implied that alleviation of plasma homocysteine level by phytoestrogen a-zearalanol might be related to the reduction of cystathionine ß-synthase nitration.

Human cystathionine ß-synthase (hCBS) is a key enzyme of sulfur amino acid metabolism, controlling the commitment of homocysteine to the transsulfuration pathway and antioxidant defense. Mutations in hCBS cause inherited homocystinuria (HCU), a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by accumulation of toxic homocysteine in blood and urine. hCBS is a complex multidomain and oligomeric protein whose activity and stability are independently regulated by the binding of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) to two different types of sites at its C-terminal regulatory domain. Here we study the role of surface electrostatics on the complex regulation and stability of hCBS using biophysical and biochemical procedures. We show that the kinetic stability of the catalytic and regulatory domains is significantly affected by the modulation of surface electrostatics through noticeable structural and energetic changes along their denaturation pathways. We also show that surface electrostatics strongly affect SAM binding properties to those sites responsible for either enzyme activation or kinetic stabilization. Our results provide new insight into the regulation of hCBS activity and stability in vivo with implications for understanding HCU as a conformational disease. We also lend experimental support to the role of electrostatic interactions in the recently proposed binding modes of SAM leading to hCBS activation and kinetic stabilization.

OBJECTIVE: It is important for psychiatrists to be aware of certain inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) as these rare disorders can present as psychosis, and because definitive treatments may be available for treating the underlying metabolic cause. A systematic review was conducted to examine IEMs that often present with schizophrenia-like symptoms.DATA SOURCES: Published literature on MEDLINE was assessed regarding diseases of homocysteine metabolism (DHM; cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency [CbS-D] and homocysteinemia due to methyltetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency [MTHFR-D]), urea cycle disorders (UCD), acute porphyria (POR), Wilson disease (WD), cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis (CTX) and Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C).STUDY SELECTION: Case reports, case series or reviews with original data regarding psychiatric manifestations and cognitive impairment published between January 1967 and June 2012 were included based on a standardized four-step selection process.DATA EXTRACTION: All selected articles were evaluated for descriptions of psychiatric signs (type, severity, natural history and treatment) in addition to key disease features.RESULTS: A total of 611 records were identified. Information from CbS-D (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2), MTHFR-D (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3), UCD (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8), POR (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>12), WD (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11), CTX (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>14) and NP-C publications (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>9) were evaluated. Six non-systematic literature review publications were also included. In general, published reports did not provide explicit descriptions of psychiatric symptoms. The literature search findings are presented with a didactic perspective, showing key features for each disease and psychiatric signs that should trigger psychiatrists to suspect that psychotic symptoms may be secondary to an IEM.CONCLUSION: IEMs with a psychiatric presentation and a lack of, or sub-clinical, neurological signs are rare, but should be considered in patients with atypical psychiatric symptoms.

AIMS: Mitochondrion is considered as the major source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). H2S has been reported to be an antioxidant, but its mechanism remains largely elusive. P66Shc is an upstream activator of mitochondrial redox signaling. The aim of this study was to explore whether the antioxidant effect of H2S is mediated by p66Shc.RESULTS: Application of exogenous H2S with its donor, NaHS, or overexpression of its generating enzyme, cystathionine ß-synthase, induced sulfhydration of p66Shc, but inhibited its phosphorylation caused by H2O2/D-galactose in SH-SY5Y cells or in the mice cortex. H2S also decreased mitochondrial ROS production and protected neuronal cells against stress-induced senescence. PKCßII and PP2A are the two key proteins to regulate p66Shc phosphorylation. Although H2S failed to affect the activities of these two proteins, it disrupted their association. Cysteine-59 resides in proximity to serine-36, the phosphorylation site of p66Shc. The C59S mutant attenuated the above-described biological function of H2S.INNOVATION: We revealed a novel mechanism for the antioxidant effect of H2S and its role in oxidative stress-related diseases.CONCLUSION: H2S inhibits mitochondrial ROS production via the sulfhydration of Cys-59 residue, which in turn, prevents the phosphorylation of p66Shc.

BACKGROUND: Cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions such as protein biosynthesis, methylation, and polyamine and glutathione syntheses. In trypanosomatids, glutathione is conjugated with spermidine to form the specific antioxidant thiol trypanothione (T[SH]2) that plays a central role in maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and providing defence against oxidative stress.METHODS: We cloned and characterised genes coding for a cystathionine ß-synthase (CßS) and cysteine synthase (CS), key enzymes of the transsulfuration and assimilatory pathways, respectively, from the hemoflagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma rangeli.RESULTS: Our results show that T. rangeli CßS (TrCßS), similar to its homologs in T. cruzi, contains the catalytic domain essential for enzymatic activity. Unlike the enzymes in bacteria, plants, and other parasites, T. rangeli CS lacks two of the four lysine residues (Lys26 and Lys184) required for activity. Enzymatic studies using T. rangeli extracts confirmed the absence of CS activity but confirmed the expression of an active CßS. Moreover, CßS biochemical assays revealed that the T. rangeli CßS enzyme also has serine sulfhydrylase activity.CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the RTS pathway is active in T. rangeli, suggesting that this may be the only pathway for cysteine biosynthesis in this parasite. In this sense, the RTS pathway appears to have an important functional role during the insect stage of the life cycle of this protozoan parasite.

The kidney is one of the major loci for the expression of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). While CBS-deficient (Cbs(-/-)) mice display homocysteinemia/methioninemia and severe growth retardation, and rarely survive beyond the first 4 wk, CTH-deficient (Cth(-/-)) mice show homocysteinemia/cystathioninemia but develop with no apparent abnormality. This study examined renal amino acid reabsorption in those mice. Although both 2-wk-old Cbs(-/-) and Cth(-/-) mice had normal renal architecture, their serum/urinary amino acid profiles largely differed from wild-type mice. The most striking feature was marked accumulation of Met and cystathionine in serum/urine/kidney samples of Cbs(-/-) and Cth(-/-) mice, respectively. Levels of some neutral amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile, and Tyr) that were not elevated in Cbs(-/-) serum were highly elevated in Cbs(-/-) urine, and urinary excretion of other neutral amino acids (except Met) was much higher than expected from their serum levels, demonstrating neutral aminoaciduria in Cbs(-/-) (not Cth(-/-)) mice. Because the bulk of neutral amino acids is absorbed via a B(0)AT1 transporter and Met has the highest substrate affinity for B(0)AT1 than other neutral amino acids, hypermethioninemia may cause hyperexcretion of neutral amino acids.

The current study investigated the role of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in oxygen sensing, intracellular signalling and promotion of ventilatory responses to hypoxia in adult and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Both larval and adult zebrafish exhibited a dose-dependent increase in ventilation to sodium sulphide (Na2S), an H2S donor. In vertebrates, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) are enzymes that catalyse the endogenous production of H2S. In adult zebrafish, inhibition of both CBS and CSE with aminooxyacetate (AOA) and propargyl glycine (PPG) blunted or abolished the hypoxic hyperventilation, and the addition of Na2S to the water partially rescued the effects of inhibiting endogenous H2S production. In zebrafish larvae (4 days post-fertilization), gene knockdown of either CBS or CSE using morpholinos attenuated the hypoxic ventilatory response. Furthermore, the intracellular calcium concentration of isolated neuroepithelial cells (NECs), which are putative oxygen chemoreceptors, increased significantly when these cells were exposed to 50 µm Na2S, supporting a role for H2S in Ca(2+)-evoked neurotransmitter release in these cells. Finally, immunohistochemical labelling showed that NECs dissociated from adult gill contained CBS and CSE, whereas cutaneous NECs in larval zebrafish expressed only CSE. Taken together, these data show that H2S can be produced in the putative oxygen-sensing cells of zebrafish, the NECs, in which it appears to play a pivotal role in promoting the hypoxic ventilatory response.

Gas transmitters are perhaps the most ancient class of molecules used by nervous systems for chemical communication. Three gases are generally recognized as being produced by neurons: nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). As part of an ongoing effort to identify and characterize the neurochemical signaling systems of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the biomass dominant zooplankton in much of the North Atlantic Ocean, we have mined a de novo assembled transcriptome for sequences encoding the neuronal biosynthetic enzymes of these gases, i.e. nitric oxide synthase (NOS), heme oxygenase (HO) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), respectively. Using Drosophila proteins as queries, two NOS-, one HO-, and one CBS-encoding transcripts were identified. Reverse BLAST and structural analyses of the deduced proteins suggest that each is a true member of its respective enzyme family. RNA-Seq data collected from embryos, early nauplii, late nauplii, early copepodites, late copepodites and adults revealed the expression of each transcript to be stage specific: one NOS restricted primarily to the embryo and the other was absent in the embryo but expressed in all other stages, no CBS expression in the embryo, but present in all other stages, and HO expressed across all developmental stages. Given the importance of gas transmitters in the regulatory control of a number of physiological processes, these data open opportunities for investigating the roles these proteins play under different life-stage and environmental conditions in this ecologically important species.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a well known toxic gas that is synthesized from the amino acids: cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) by three enzymes: cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). Hydrogen sulfide, like carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule in different biological systems, including the cardiovascular system. Moreover, hydrogen sulfide plays a role in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. It modulates different elements of hemostasis (activation of blood platelet, and coagulation process) as well as proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the biological role and the therapeutic potential of H2S is not clear. This review summarizes the different functions of hydrogen sulfide in hemostasis.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is prevalent in patients with hypertension and is an independent risk factor for aortic pathologies. HHcy is known to cause an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), leading to the accumulation of collagen in the aorta and resulting in stiffness and development of hypertension. Although the exact mechanism of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is unclear, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic regulation involving DNA methylation. Our purpose was to investigate whether 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) inhibitor, reduces high blood pressure (BP) by regulating aortic ECM remodeling in HHcy. Wild-type and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)(+/-) HHcy mice were treated with Aza (0.5 mg/kg body weight). In HHcy mice, Aza treatment normalized the plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and BP. Thoracic and abdominal aorta ultrasound revealed a reduction in the resistive index and wall-to-lumen ratio. Vascular response to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside improved after Aza in HHcy mice. Histology showed a marked reduction in collagen deposition in the aorta. Aza treatment decreased the expression of DNMT1, MMP9, TIMP1, and S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and upregulated methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). We conclude that reduction of DNA methylation by Aza in HHcy reduces adverse aortic remodeling to mitigate hypertension.

Using methodology developed herein, it is found that reactive persulfides and polysulfides are formed endogenously from both small molecule species and proteins in high amounts in mammalian cells and tissues. These reactive sulfur species were biosynthesized by two major sulfurtransferases: cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. Quantitation of these species indicates that high concentrations of glutathione persulfide (perhydropersulfide &gt;100 µM) and other cysteine persulfide and polysulfide derivatives in peptides/proteins were endogenously produced and maintained in the plasma, cells, and tissues of mammals (rodent and human). It is expected that persulfides are especially nucleophilic and reducing. This view was found to be the case, because they quickly react with H2O2 and a recently described biologically generated electrophile 8-nitroguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. These results indicate that persulfides are potentially important signaling/effector species, and because H2S can be generated from persulfide degradation, much of the reported biological activity associated with H2S may actually be that of persulfides. That is, H2S may act primarily as a marker for the biologically active of persulfide species.

SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer represents a major socioeconomic problem; there is a significant need for novel therapeutic approaches targeting tumor-specific pathways.RECENT ADVANCES: In colorectal and ovarian cancers, an increase in the intratumor production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) plays an important role in promoting the cellular bioenergetics, proliferation, and migration of cancer cells. It also stimulates peritumor angiogenesis inhibition or genetic silencing of CBS exerts antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of anticancer therapeutics.CRITICAL ISSUES: Recently published studies are reviewed, implicating CBS overexpression and H2S overproduction in tumor cells as a tumor-growth promoting &quot;bioenergetic fuel&quot; and &quot;survival factor,&quot; followed by an overview of the experimental evidence demonstrating the anticancer effect of CBS inhibition. Next, the current state of the art of pharmacological CBS inhibitors is reviewed, with special reference to the complex pharmacological actions of aminooxyacetic acid. Finally, new experimental evidence is presented to reconcile a controversy in the literature regarding the effects of H2S donor on cancer cell proliferation and survival.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: From a basic science standpoint, future directions in the field include the delineation of the molecular mechanism of CBS up-regulation of cancer cells and the delineation of the interactions of H2S with other intracellular pathways of cancer cell metabolism and proliferation. From the translational science standpoint, future directions include the translation of the recently emerging roles of H2S in cancer into human diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) is caused in part by the effects of ethanol (EtOH) on hepatic methionine metabolism.METHODS: To investigate the phenotypic and epigenetic consequences of altered methionine metabolism in this disease, we studied the effects of 4-week intragastric EtOH feeding with and without the methyl donor betaine in cystathionine beta synthase (CßS) heterozygous C57BL/6J mice.RESULTS: The histopathology of early ASH was induced by EtOH feeding and prevented by betaine supplementation, while EtOH feeding reduced and betaine supplementation maintained the hepatic methylation ratio of the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). MethylC-seq genomic sequencing of heterozygous liver samples from each diet group found 2 to 4% reduced methylation in gene bodies, but not promoter regions of all autosomes of EtOH-fed mice, each of which were normalized in samples from mice fed the betaine-supplemented diet. The transcript levels of nitric oxide synthase (Nos2) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) were increased, while those of peroxisome proliferator receptor-a (Ppara) were reduced in EtOH-fed mice, and each was normalized in mice fed the betaine-supplemented diet. DNA pyrosequencing of CßS heterozygous samples found reduced methylation in a gene body of Nos2 by EtOH feeding that was restored by betaine supplementation and was correlated inversely with its expression and positively with SAM/SAH ratios.CONCLUSIONS: The present study has demonstrated relationships among EtOH induction of ASH with aberrant methionine metabolism that was associated with gene body DNA hypomethylation in all autosomes and was prevented by betaine supplementation. The data imply that EtOH-induced changes in selected gene transcript levels and hypomethylation in gene bodies during the induction of ASH are a result of altered methionine metabolism that can be reversed through dietary supplementation of methyl donors.

Gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are produced endogenously and mediate effects through diverse mechanisms. H2S is one such gasotransmitters that regulates multiple signaling pathways in mammalian cells, and abnormal H2S metabolism has been linked to defects in bone homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) produce H2S in order to regulate their self-renewal and osteogenic differentiation, and H2S deficiency results in defects in BMMSC differentiation. H2S deficiency causes aberrant intracellular Ca(2+) influx because of reduced sulfhydration of cysteine residues on multiple Ca(2+) TRP channels. This decreased Ca(2+) flux downregulates PKC/Erk-mediated Wnt/ß-catenin signaling which controls osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs. Consistently, H2S-deficient mice display an osteoporotic phenotype that can be rescued by small molecules that release H2S. These results demonstrate that H2S regulates BMMSCs and that restoring H2S levels via nontoxic donors may provide treatments for diseases such as osteoporosis that can arise from H2S deficiencies.

BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) or CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNPs) is characterized by persistent inflammation of sinonasal mucosa. No one causative factor fully explains for the pathological manifestations of CRS. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to participate in inflammatory diseases, functioning as an inflammatory mediator in various organs. We analyzed the contents and synthesis activity of H2S, the expression and distribution pattern of H2S-generating enzymes, cystathione ß-synthase (CBS), and cystathione <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in CRSwNPs and CRSsNPs. The effects of H2S on the expression of CRS-relevant cytokines and the effects of cytokines on the expression of CBS and CSE were assessed in an in vitro experiment.METHODS: The contents and synthesis activity of H2S and the expression and distribution pattern of CBS and CSE in sinus mucosa were evaluated using spectrophotometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Cultured epithelial cells were used to elucidate the effects of H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), on the expression of CRS-relevant cytokines and the effects of cytokines on H2S-generating enzymes expression.RESULTS: The contents and synthesis activity of H2S were increased in CRSwNPs and CRSsNPs. CBS and CSE were localized to the superficial epithelium and submucosal glands, but CSE was also found in vascular endothelium. NaHS induced increased expression of IL-4, IL-5, interferon <U+03B3>, and TNF-a. CBS and CSE expression in cultured cells was up-regulated by CRS-relevant cytokines.CONCLUSION: H2S levels are increased in CRS, contributing to increased production of cytokines. These results suggest that H2S may function as inflammatory mediator in CRS.

Ancient conserved domain protein/cyclin M (CNNM) family proteins are evolutionarily conserved Mg(2+) transporters. However, their biochemical mechanism of action remains unknown. Here, we show the functional importance of the commonly conserved cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domains and reveal their unique binding ability to ATP. Deletion mutants of CNNM2 and CNNM4, lacking the CBS domains, are unable to promote Mg(2+) efflux. Furthermore, the substitution of one amino acid residue in the CBS domains of CNNM2, which is associated with human hereditary hypomagnesemia, abrogates Mg(2+) efflux. Binding analyses reveal that the CBS domains of CNNM2 bind directly to ATP and not AMP in a manner dependent on the presence of Mg(2+), which is inhibited in a similar pattern by the disease-associated amino acid substitution. The requirement of Mg(2+) for these interactions is a unique feature among CBS domains, which can be explained by the presence of highly electronegative surface potentials around the ATP binding site on CNNM2. These results demonstrate that the CBS domains play essential roles in Mg(2+) efflux, probably through interactions with ATP. Interactions with ATP, which mostly forms complexes with Mg(2+) in cells, may account for the rapid Mg(2+) transport by CNNM family proteins.

AIMS: Mitochondria are known to play a central role in adrenocortical steroidogenesis. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous transmitter endogenously produced by cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), has been found to improve mitochondrial function. The present study aimed at examining whether CBS and CSE are expressed in adrenal glands, and investigated the role of these enzymes in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and the production of glucocorticoids in adrenocortical cells.RESULTS: Both CBS and CSE are present in murine adrenocortical cells and account for H2S generation in adrenal glands. Using a combination of both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that either CBS/CSE inhibitors or small interfering RNAs led to mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction, which meanwhile resulted in blunted corticosterone responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). These effects were significantly attenuated by the treatment of H2S donor GYY4137. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also caused mitochondrial damage, thereby resulting in adrenal insufficiency. Moreover, LPS inhibited CBS/CSE expression and H2S production in adrenal glands, while H2S donor GYY4137 protected against LPS-induced mitochondrial damage and hyporesponsiveness to ACTH. Local suppression of CBS or CSE in adrenal glands significantly increased the mortality in endotoxemic mice, which was also improved by GYY4137.INNOVATION: The identification of endogenous H2S generation as critical regulators of adrenocortical responsiveness might result in the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of relative adrenal insufficiency during sepsis.CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous H2S plays a critical role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function in the adrenal cortex, thereby resulting in an adequate adrenocortical response to ACTH.

Recent data show that colon cancer cells selectively overexpress cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), which produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S), to maintain cellular bioenergetics, support tumor growth and stimulate angiogenesis and vasorelaxation in the tumor microenvironment. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of the allosteric CBS activator S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) on the proliferation and bioenergetics of the CBS-expressing colon cancer cell line HCT116. The non-transformed, non-tumorigenic colon epithelial cell line NCM356 was used as control. For assessment of cell proliferation, the xCELLigence system was used. Bioenergetic function was measured by Extracellular Flux Analysis. Experiments using human recombinant CBS or HCT116 homogenates complemented the cell-based studies. SAM markedly enhanced CBS-mediated H2S production in vitro, especially when a combination of cysteine and homocysteine was used as substrates. Addition of SAM (0.1-3 mM) to HCT116 cells induced a concentration-dependent increase H2S production. SAM exerted time- and concentration-dependent modulatory effects on cell proliferation. At 0.1-1 mM SAM increased HCT116 proliferation between 0 and 12 h, while the highest SAM concentration (3 mM) inhibited proliferation. Over a longer time period (12-24 h), only the lowest concentration of SAM used (0.1 mM) stimulated cell proliferation; higher SAM concentrations produced a concentration-dependent inhibition. The short-term stimulatory effects of SAM were attenuated by the CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) or by stable silencing of CBS. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of SAM on cell proliferation was unaffected by CBS inhibition or CBS silencing. In contrast to HCT116 cells, the lower rate of proliferation of the low-CBS expressor NCM356 cells was unaffected by SAM. Short-term (1 h) exposure of HCT116 cells to SAM induced a concentration-dependent increase in oxygen consumption and bioenergetic function at 0.1-1 mM, while 3 mM was inhibitory. Longer-term (72 h) exposure of HCT116 cells to all concentrations of SAM tested suppressed mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, cellular ATP content and cell viability. The stimulatory effect of SAM on bioenergetics was attenuated in cells with stable CBS silencing, while the inhibitory effects were unaffected. In NCM356 cells SAM exerted smaller effects on cellular bioenergetics than in HCT116 cells. We have also observed a downregulation of CBS in response to prolonged exposure of SAM both in HCT116 and NCM356 cells. Taken together, the results demonstrate that H2S production in HCT116 cells is stimulated by the allosteric CBS activator, SAM. At low-to intermediate levels and early time periods the resulting H2S serves as an endogenous cancer cell growth and bioenergetic factor. In contrast, the inhibition of cell proliferation and bioenergetic function by SAM does not appear to relate to adverse autocrine effects of H2S resulting from CBS over-stimulation but, rather to CBS-independent pharmacological effects.

Numerous papers have been published on the role of H2S during circulatory shock. Consequently, knowledge about vascular sulfide concentrations may assume major importance, in particular in the context of &quot;acute on chronic disease&quot;, i.e., during circulatory shock in animals with pre-existing chronic disease. This review addresses the questions (i) of the &quot;real&quot; sulfide levels during circulatory shock, and (ii) to which extent injury and pre-existing co-morbidity may affect the expression of H2S producing enzymes under these conditions. In the literature there is a huge range on sulfide blood levels during circulatory shock, in part as a result of the different analytical methods used, but also due to the variable of the models and species studied. Clearly, some of the very high levels reported should be questioned in the context of the well-known H2S toxicity. As long as &quot;real&quot; sulfide levels during circulatory shock are unknown and/or undetectable &quot;on line&quot; due to the lack of appropriate techniques, it appears to be premature to correlate the measured blood levels of hydrogen sulfide with the severity of shock or the H2S therapy-related biological outcomes. The available data on the tissue expression of the H2S-releasing enzymes during circulatory shock suggest that a &quot;constitutive&quot; CSE expression may play a crucial role of for the maintenance of organ function, at least in the kidney. The data also indicate that increased CBS and CSE expression, in particular in the lung and the liver, represents an adaptive response to stress states.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has complex effects in inflammation with both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions of this gas reported. Recent work suggests that a deficiency of H2S occurs in, and may contribute to, the chronic inflammation which underpins ongoing atherosclerotic disease. However, whether a high fat diet, predisposing to atherosclerosis, affects H2S metabolism is not known. In this study we assessed H2S metabolism in different tissues of mice fed a high fat diet for up to 16 weeks. Ex vivo biosynthesis of H2S was reduced in liver, kidney and lung of high fat fed mice. Western blotting revealed deficiency of cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) in liver and lung with increased expression of cystathionine ß synthetase (CBS) in liver and kidney. Expression of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) was reduced in liver but not other tissues. Aortic endothelial cell CSE was also reduced in high fat fed animals as determined immunohistochemically. Plasma H2S concentration was not changed in these animals. No evidence of lipid deposition was apparent in aortae from high fat fed animals and plasma serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also unchanged suggesting lack of frank atherosclerotic disease. Plasma IL-6, IL12p40 and G-CSF levels were increased by high fat feeding whilst other cytokines including IL-1a, IL-1b and TNF-a were not altered. These results suggest that deficiency of tissue CSE and H2S occurs in mice fed a high fat diet and that this change takes place prior to development of frank atherosclerotic disease.

Haem oxygenase (HO)-1/carbon monoxide (CO) protects cancer cells from oxidative stress, but the gas-responsive signalling mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show using metabolomics that CO-sensitive methylation of PFKFB3, an enzyme producing fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), serves as a switch to activate phosphofructokinase-1, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme. In human leukaemia U937 cells, PFKFB3 is asymmetrically di-methylated at R131 and R134 through modification by protein arginine methyltransferase 1. HO-1 induction or CO results in reduced methylation of PFKFB3 in varied cancer cells to suppress F-2,6-BP, shifting glucose utilization from glycolysis toward the pentose phosphate pathway. Loss of PFKFB3 methylation depends on the inhibitory effects of CO on haem-containing cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). CBS modulates remethylation metabolism, and increases NADPH to supply reduced glutathione, protecting cells from oxidative stress and anti-cancer reagents. Once the methylation of PFKFB3 is reduced, the protein undergoes polyubiquitination and is degraded in the proteasome. These results suggest that the CO/CBS-dependent regulation of PFKFB3 methylation determines directional glucose utilization to ensure resistance against oxidative stress for cancer cell survival.

AIMS: The manner in which hydrogen sulfide (H2S) suppresses neuroinflammation is poorly understood. We investigated whether H2S polarized microglia to an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).RESULTS: Three structurally unrelated H2S donors (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiocyclopentene-3-thione [ADT-OH], (p-methoxyphenyl) morpholino-phosphinodithioic acid [GYY4137], and sodium hydrosulfide [NaHS]) enhanced AMPK activation in BV2 microglial cells in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The overexpression of the H2S synthase cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) in BV2 cells enhanced endogenous H2S production and AMPK activation regardless of LPS stimulation. On LPS stimulation, overexpression of both ADT-OH and CBS promoted M2 polarization of BV2 cells, as evidenced by suppressed M1 and elevated M2 signature gene expression. The promoting effects of ADT-OH on M2 polarization were attenuated by an AMPK inhibitor or AMPK knockdown. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase ß (CaMKKß) are upstream kinases that activate AMPK. ADT-OH activated AMPK in Hela cells lacking LKB1. In contrast, both the CaMKKß inhibitor and siRNA abolished ADT-OH activation of AMPK in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Moreover, the CaMKKß inhibitor and siRNA blunted ADT-OH suppression on M1 gene expression and enhancement of M2 gene expression in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Moreover, ADT-OH promoted M2 polarization of primary microglia in an AMPK activation- and CaMKKß-dependent manner. Finally, in an LPS-induced in vivo neuroinflammation model, both ADT-OH and NaHS enhanced AMPK activation in the brain area where microglia were over-activated on LPS stimulation. Furthermore, ADT-OH suppressed M1 and promoted M2 gene expression in this in vivo model.INNOVATION AND CONCLUSION: CaMKKß-dependent AMPK activation is an unrecognized mechanism underlying H2S suppression on neuroinflammation.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a gaseous neuromodulator produced from L-cysteine. H2 S is generated by three distinct enzymatic pathways mediated by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST) coupled with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). This study investigated the relative contributions of these three pathways to H2 S production in PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma-derived cells) and the rat dorsal root ganglion. CBS, CAT, and MPST, but not CSE, were expressed in the cells and tissues, and appreciable amounts of H2 S were produced from L-cysteine in the presence of a-ketoglutarate, together with dithiothreitol. The production of H2 S was inhibited by a CAT inhibitor (aminooxyacetic acid), competitive CAT substrates (L-aspartate and oxaloacetate), and RNA interference (RNAi) against MPST. Immunocytochemistry revealed a mitochondrial localization of MPST in PC12 cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons, and the amount of H2 S produced by CAT/MPST at pH 8.0, a physiological mitochondrial matrix pH, was comparable to that produced by CSE and CBS in the liver and the brain, respectively. Furthermore, H2 S production was markedly increased by alkalization. These results indicate that CAT and MPST are primarily responsible for H2 S production in peripheral neurons, and that the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism may influence neuronal H2 S generation. In the peripheral nervous system, hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) has been implicated in neurogenic pain or hyperalgesia. This study provides evidence that H2 S is synthesized in peripheral neurons through two mitochondrial enzymes, cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). We propose that mitochondrial metabolism plays key roles in the physiology and pathophysiology of the peripheral nervous system via regulation of neuronal H2 S production.

The oxidation of cysteine in mammalian cells occurs by two routes: a highly regulated direct oxidation pathway in which the first step is catalyzed by cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) and by desulfhydration-oxidation pathways in which the sulfur is released in a reduced oxidation state. To assess the effect of a lack of CDO on production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and thiosulfate (an intermediate in the oxidation of H2S to sulfate) and to explore the roles of both cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) in cysteine desulfhydration by liver, we investigated the metabolism of cysteine in hepatocytes isolated from Cdo1-null and wild-type mice. Hepatocytes from Cdo1-null mice produced more H2S and thiosulfate than did hepatocytes from wild-type mice. The greater flux of cysteine through the cysteine desulfhydration reactions catalyzed by CTH and CBS in hepatocytes from Cdo1-null mice appeared to be the consequence of their higher cysteine levels, which were due to the lack of CDO and hence lack of catabolism of cysteine by the cysteinesulfinate-dependent pathways. Both CBS and CTH appeared to contribute substantially to cysteine desulfhydration, with estimates of 56 % by CBS and 44 % by CTH in hepatocytes from wild-type mice, and 63 % by CBS and 37 % by CTH in hepatocytes from Cdo1-null mice.

Freshwater invertebrates are often exposed to metal contamination, and changes in gene expression patterns can help understand mechanisms underlying toxicity and act as pollutant-specific biomarkers. In this study the expressions of genes involved in cysteine metabolism are characterized in the midge Chironomus tepperi during exposures to sublethal concentrations of cadmium and copper. These metals altered gene expression of the cysteine metabolism differently. Both metals decreased S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase expression and did not change the expression of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Cadmium exposure likely increased cystathionine production by up-regulating cystathionine-ß-synthase (CßS) expression, while maintaining control level cysteine production via cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (C<U+03B3>L) expression. Conversely, copper down-regulated CßS expression and up-regulated C<U+03B3>L expression, which in turn could diminish cystathionine to favor cysteine production. Both metals up-regulated glutathione related expression (<U+03B3>-glutamylcysteine synthase and glutathione synthetase). Only cadmium up-regulated metallothionein expression and glutathione S-transferase d1 expression was up-regulated only by copper exposure. These different transcription responses of genes involved in cysteine metabolism in C. tepperi point to metal-specific detoxification pathways and suggest that the transsulfuration pathway could provide biomarkers for identifying specific metals.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine, with the release of water. In humans, deficiency in CBS activity is the most common cause of hyperhomocysteinaemia and homocystinuria. More than 160 pathogenic mutations in the human CBS gene have been described to date. Here, the purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the catalytic core of CBS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScCBS) is described which, in contrast to other eukaryotic CBSs, lacks the N-terminal haem-binding domain and is considered to be a useful model for investigation of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-mediated reactions of human CBS (hCBS). The purified protein yielded two different crystal forms belonging to space groups P41212 and P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 72.390, c = 386.794 Å and a = 58.156, b = 89.988, c = 121.687 Å, respectively. Diffraction data were collected to 2.7 and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively, using synchrotron radiation. Preliminary analysis of the X-ray data suggests the presence of ScCBS homodimers in both types of crystals.

Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis is unusual during childhood and requires early and accurate management because of its detrimental consequences. We report on the case of a 2-year-old boy with mild psychomotor delay, who presented with nonfebrile acute ataxia. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus, confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography and associated with a right frontal hemorrhagic infarction. Systematic screening for thrombophilia revealed homocystinuria linked to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency with underlying compound heterozygosity. The evolution was favorable after anticoagulant therapy, specific diet, and vitamin supplementation. This case is of interest because of the unusual clinical presentation as a pediatric cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. Furthermore, homocystinuria is rarely revealed by cerebral sinovenous thrombosis at the onset of the disease and should systematically be ruled out in pediatric stroke.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with elderly frailty, skeletal muscle injury and malfunction, reduced vascular integrity and function, and mortality. Although HHcy has been implicated in the impairment of angiogenesis after hindlimb ischemia in murine models, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We hypothesized that HHcy compromises skeletal muscle perfusion, collateral formation, and arteriogenesis by diminishing postischemic vasculogenic responses in muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we created femoral artery ligation in wild-type and heterozygous cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS(+/-)) mice (a model for HHcy) and assessed tissue perfusion, collateral vessel formation, and skeletal muscle function using laser-Doppler perfusion imaging, barium angiography, and fatigue tests. In addition, we assessed postischemic levels of VEGF and levels of its muscle-specific regulators: hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator (PGC)-1a. The observations indicated dysregulation of VEGF, HIF-1a, and PGC-1a levels in ischemic skeletal muscles of CBS(+/-) mice. Concomitant with the reduced ischemic angiogenic responses, we also observed diminished leptin expression and attenuated Akt signaling in ischemic muscle fibers of CBS(+/-) mice. Moreover, there was enhanced atrogene, ubiquitin ligases that conjugate proteins for degradation during muscle atrophy, transcription, and reduced muscle function after ischemia in CBS(+/-) mice. These results suggest that HHcy adversely affects muscle-specific ischemic responses and contributes to muscle frailty.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter that regulates numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes in our body. Enzymatic production of H2S is catalyzed by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). All these three enzymes present in the liver and via H2S production regulate liver functions. The liver is the hub for metabolism of glucose and lipids, and maintains the level of circulatory lipids through lipoprotein metabolism. Hepatic H2S metabolism affects glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein synthesis, mitochondrial biogenetics and biogenesis. Malfunction of hepatic H2S metabolism may be involved in many liver diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis and hepatic cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: Increased levels of homocysteine have been observed in various psychiatric disorders, among them in schizophrenia, depression and bipolar mood disorder. Of the genes connected with homocysteine metabolism, some studies have found an association between polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between 5 polymorphisms of 4 genes coding enzymes of homocysteine metabolism and bipolar disorder.METHOD: A total of 120 patients with bipolar disorder (24 male, 96 female) and 167 subjects from the general population (81 male, 86 female) were included in the study. Genotyping was performed for the C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene, for the T833C polymorphism (rs5742905) of the cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) gene, for the A2756G polymorphism (rs1805087) of the homocysteine methyltransferase gene, and for the A66G polymorphism (rs1801394) of the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) gene.RESULTS: An association with bipolar disorder was found for the T833C polymorphism (rs5742905) of the CBS gene. However, in the patient sample, the genotypes of this polymorphism were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No relationship to bipolar disorder was obtained for the remaining polymorphisms studied.CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first suggesting a possible association between T833C polymorphism (rs5742905) of the CBS gene and bipolar disorder. We were unable to confirm an association between bipolar disorder and C677T polymorphism (rs1801133) of the MTHFR gene, as suggested in some previous studies.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication of congenital heart disease (CHD). Although risk stratification is vital for prognosis and therapeutic guidance, the need for understanding the role of novel biomarkers cannot be overlooked. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of homocysteine and hydrogen sulfide levels and find potential biomarkers for early detection and treatment.METHODS: Between September 2012 and April 2013, we prospectively collected data on 158 pediatric patients with left to right shunt CHD at our institution. Standard right heart catheterizations were performed in all cases. Seventy-seven cases were associated with PH. The levels of homocysteine and hydrogen sulfide were detected with fluorescence polarization immunoassay and a sensitive silver-sulphur electrode, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). Radioimmunoassays were used to obtain folic acid and vitamin B12 levels.RESULTS: The difference in the levels of homocysteine, folic acid, vitamin B12, hydrogen sulfide, as well as the MTHFR and CSE expression between patients with PH and without PH were statistically significant (all P &lt; 0.05). Homocysteine had the best sensitivity and specificity to predict PH (P &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the levels of homocysteine and hydrogen sulfide, and the expression of CSE and MTHFR between patients with dynamic and obstructive PH were significantly different (all P &lt; 0.05). Based on the ROC curve, homocysteine had the best sensitivity and specificity to predict obstructive PH (P = 0.032), while CSE had the most significant sensitivity and specificity to predict the dynamic PH (P = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of homocysteine and decreased levels of hydrogen sulfide were significantly negatively correlated in PH associated with CHD. The underlying mechanism involved the decreased expression of MTHFR and CSE along with vitamin B12 deficiency. Homocysteine and hydrogen sulfide are potential biomarkers to predict PH.

BACKGROUND: Folate plays a pivotal role in DNA synthesis, repair, methylation and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism. Therefore, alterations in the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism may lead to abnormal methylation proliferation, increases of tumor/neoplasia and vein thrombosis/cardiovascular risk. The serine hydroxymethyhransferase (SHMT), methionine synthase (MS), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) regulate key reactions in the folate and Hcy metabolism. Therefore, we investigated whether the genetic variants of the SHMT, MS, MTRR and CBS gene can affect plasma Hcy levels and are associated with breast cancer risk.METHODS: Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP method. Plasma Hcy levels were measured by the fluorescence polarization immunoassay on samples of 96 cases and 85 controls.RESULTS: (a) The SHMT 1420 T, MS 2756G, MTRR 66G allele frequency distribution showed significant difference between case and controls (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.05). (b) The concentration of plasma Hcy levels of SHMT 1420TT was significantly lower than that of the wild type, while the plasma Hcy levels of MS 2756GG, CBS 699TT/1080TT significantly higher than that of the wild type both in case and controls. The plasma Hcy levels of MTRR 66GG was significantly higher than that of wild type in cases. The plasma Hcy levels of the same genotype in cases were significantly higher than those of controls except SHMT 1420CC, MS 2756AA, MTRR 66GG; (c) Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that SHMT C1420T (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.527, 95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.55<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.24), MS A2756G (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.32, 95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.29<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.82), MTRR A66G (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.84, 95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.66) polymorphism is significantly associated with breast cancer risk. And elevated plasma Hcy levels were significantly linked to increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.45, 95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.89-6.24 for the highest tertile as compared with the lowest tertile).CONCLUSIONS: The current study results seem to suggest a possibility that SHMT C1420T mutation may be negatively correlated with breast cancer susceptibility; while MS A2756G and MTRR A66G mutation may be positively associated with breast cancer risk. SHMT C1420T, MS A2756G, MTRR A66G, CBS C1080T, CBS C699T locus mutation may be factors affecting plasma levels of Hcy. The plasma Hcy levels could be metabolic risk factor for breast cancer risk to a certain extent.

This study was designed to examine the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the generation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-stimulated monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) from macrophages and possible mechanisms. THP-1 cells and RAW macrophages were pretreated with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and hexyl acrylate and then treated with ox-LDL. The results showed that ox-LDL treatment down-regulated the H2S/cystathionine-ß-synthase pathway, with increased MCP-1 protein and mRNA expression in both THP-1 cells and RAW macrophages. Hexyl acrylate promoted ox-LDL-induced inflammation, whereas the H2S donor NaHS inhibited it. NaHS markedly suppressed NF-<U+03BA>B p65 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity, and recruitment to the MCP-1 promoter in ox-LDL-treated macrophages. Furthermore, NaHS decreased the ratio of free thiol groups in p65, whereas the thiol reductant DTT reversed the inhibiting effect of H2S on the p65 DNA binding activity. Most importantly, site-specific mutation of cysteine 38 to serine in p65 abolished the effect of H2S on the sulfhydration of NF-<U+03BA>B and ox-LDL-induced NF-<U+03BA>B activation. These results suggested that endogenous H2S inhibited ox-LDL-induced macrophage inflammation by suppressing NF-<U+03BA>B p65 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity, and recruitment to the MCP-1 promoter. The sulfhydration of free thiol group on cysteine 38 in p65 served as a molecular mechanism by which H2S inhibited NF-<U+03BA>B pathway activation in ox-LDL-induced macrophage inflammation.

High blood levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are found in patients affected by homocystinuria, a genetic disorder caused by deficiency of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) activity, as well as in nutritional deficiencies (vitamin B12 or folate) and in abnormal renal function. We previously demonstrated that lipid and protein oxidative damage is increased and the antioxidant defenses diminished in plasma of CBS-deficient patients, indicating that oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of this disease. In the present work, we extended these investigations by evaluating DNA damage through the comet assay in peripheral leukocytes from CBS-deficient patients, as well as by analyzing of the in vitro effect of Hcy on DNA damage in white blood cells. We verified that DNA damage was significantly higher in the CBS-deficient patients under treatment based on a protein-restricted diet and pyridoxine, folic acid, betaine and vitamin B12 supplementation, when compared to controls. Furthermore, the in vitro study showed a concentration-dependent effect of Hcy inducing DNA damage. Taken together, the present data indicate that DNA damage occurs in treated CBS-deficient patients, possibly due to high Hcy levels.

Accumulation of the homocysteine (Hcy) precursor S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) may cause cellular hypomethylation in the setting of hyperhomocysteinemia because of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism. To test this hypothesis, DNA and protein arginine methylation status were assessed in liver, brain, heart, and kidney obtained from a previously described mouse model of CBS deficiency. Metabolite levels in tissues and serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Global DNA and protein arginine methylation status were evaluated as the contents of 5-methyldeoxycytidine in DNA and of methylarginines in proteins, respectively. In addition, histone arginine methylation was assessed by Western blotting. CBS-deficient mice exhibited increased (&gt;6-fold) Hcy and AdoHcy levels in all tissues examined compared with control levels. In addition, global DNA methylation status was not affected, but global protein arginine methylation status was decreased (10-35%) in liver and brain. Moreover, asymmetric dimethylation of arginine 3 on histone H4 (H4R3me2a) content was markedly decreased in liver, and no differences were observed for the other histone arginine methylation marks examined. Our results show that CBS-deficient mice present severe accumulation of tissue Hcy and AdoHcy, protein arginine hypomethylation in liver and brain, and decreased H4R3me2a content in liver. Therefore, protein arginine hypomethylation arises as a potential player in the pathophysiology of CBS deficiency.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) in the corpus cavernosum of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.METHODS: This study included 10 male SHRs and 10 healthy male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls, all aged 12 weeks. We applied a series of electric stimuli to the major pelvic ganglions of the rats, observed changes in the ratio of intracavernosal to mean arterial blood pressure (ICP/MAP), measured the levels of serum testosterone (T) and endogenous H2S, and determined the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: No obvious difference was found in the serum T level between the two groups. Compared with the WKY rats, the SHRs showed significant reduction in the ICP/MAP ratio, the contents of plasma H2S ([21.92 +/- 2.75] micromol/L vs [10.49 +/- 1.35] micromol/L, P &lt; 0.05) and endogenous corpus cavernosal H2S ([87.67 +/- 2.12] nmol/mg prot vs [52.60 +/- 3.44] nmol/mg prot, P &lt; 0.05), the level of endogenous H2S synthesis ([4.35 +/- 0.32] nmol/mg per min vs [1.14 +/- 0.07] nmol/mg per min, P &lt; 0.05) and the expressions of CBS and CSE (P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that CSE and CBS were distributed mainly in the smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells of the corpus cavernosum. The ICP/MAP ratio was highly positively correlated with the expressions of CSE (r = 0.977, P &lt; 0.05) and CBS (r = 0.955, P &lt; 0.05) in the corpus cavernosal tissue.CONCLUSION: Hypertension inhibits endogenous H2S synthesis by suppressing the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum, which might be related with hypertension-induced reduction of erectile function.

CP12 is a small, redox-sensitive protein, representatives of which are found in most photosynthetic organisms, including cyanobacteria, diatoms, red and green algae, and higher plants. The only clearly defined function for CP12 in any organism is in the thioredoxin-mediated regulation of the Calvin-Benson cycle. CP12 mediates the formation of a complex between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in response to changes in light intensity. Under low light, the formation of the GAPDH/PRK/CP12 complex results in a reduction in the activity of both PRK and GAPDH and, under high light conditions, thioredoxin mediates the disassociation of the complex resulting in an increase in both GAPDH and PRK activity. Although the role of CP12 in the redox-mediated formation of the GAPDH/PRK/CP12 multiprotein complex has been clearly demonstrated, a number of studies now provide evidence that the CP12 proteins may play a wider role. In Arabidopsis thaliana CP12 is expressed in a range of tissue including roots, flowers, and seeds and antisense suppression of tobacco CP12 disrupts metabolism and impacts on growth and development. Furthermore, in addition to the higher plant genomes which encode up to three forms of CP12, analysis of cyanobacterial genomes has revealed that, not only are there multiple forms of the CP12 protein, but that in these organisms CP12 is also found fused to cystathionine-ß-synthase domain containing proteins. In this review we present the latest information on the CP12 protein family and explore the possibility that CP12 proteins form part of a redox-mediated metabolic switch, allowing organisms to respond to rapid changes in the external environment.

The hexa-coordinate heme in the H2S-generating human enzyme cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) acts as a redox-sensitive regulator that impairs CBS activity upon binding of NO() or CO at the reduced iron. Despite the proposed physiological relevance of this inhibitory mechanism, unlike CO, NO() was reported to bind at the CBS heme with very low affinity (Kd = 30-281 µm). This discrepancy was herein reconciled by investigating the NO() reactivity of recombinant human CBS by static and stopped-flow UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. We found that NO() binds tightly to the ferrous CBS heme, with an apparent Kd = 0.23 µm. In line with this result, at 25 °C, NO() binds quickly to CBS (k on ~ 8 × 10(3) m(-1) s(-1)) and dissociates slowly from the enzyme (k off ~ 0.003 s(-1)). The observed rate constants for NO() binding were found to be linearly dependent on [NO()] up to ~ 800 µm NO(), and &gt;100-fold higher than those measured for CO, indicating that the reaction is not limited by the slow dissociation of Cys-52 from the heme iron, as reported for CO. For the first time the heme of human CBS is reported to bind NO() quickly and tightly, providing a mechanistic basis for the in vivo regulation of the enzyme by NO(). The novel findings reported here shed new light on CBS regulation by NO() and its possible (patho)physiological relevance, enforcing the growing evidence for an interplay among the gasotransmitters NO(), CO, and H2S in cell signaling.

AIMS: Therapeutic use of sulfhydrylated inhibitor S-zofenopril has raised different hypotheses regarding the role played by its thiol group in the beneficial clinical effects exerted compared with other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Here, we investigated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) pathway as accountable for extra-beneficial effects in vascular function.METHODS AND RESULTS: Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRs) and control Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with either S-zofenopril or enalapril in vivo. Aorta and carotid were harvested and ex vivo vascular reactivity to acetylcholine (Ach) and L-cysteine (L-cys) assessed. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptosulfur-transferase (3MST) expression, as well as H2S levels, were evaluated in both vascular tissues. The vascular response to Ach in both carotid and aorta was impaired in SHR (~30%, P &lt; 0.001). S-zofenopril, but not enalapril, restored this response, while L-cys-induced relaxation was enhanced. CSE expression in vessels and tissue/plasma H2S levels were restored to WKY values in SHRs receiving S-zofenopril. In contrast, CBS and 3MST expression were not modified by treatments. S-zofenoprilat, an active metabolite of S-zofenopril, releases H2S in a 'cell-free' assay and it directly relaxed vessels in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.001). In vivo administration of R-zofenoprilat diasteroisomer, which does not inhibit ACE, did not modify blood pressure; nonetheless, it retained the beneficial effect on SHR vascular function as well as restored plasma/tissue H2S levels.CONCLUSION: Our findings establish that S-zofenopril improves vascular function by potentiating the H2S pathway in a model of spontaneous hypertension. This novel mechanism, unrelated to ACE inhibition and based on H2S release, could explain the beneficial effects of sulfhydrylated ACE inhibitors reported in the clinical literature.

Physiological concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have multiple protective effects in the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have implicated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a new member of vasculoprotective gasotransmitter family, behaving similarly to NO and CO. H2S has been demonstrated to inhibit multiple key aspects of atherosclerosis, including atherogenic modification of LDL, monocytes adhesion to the endothelial cells, macrophage-derived foam cell formation and inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, neointimal hyperplasia, vascular calcification, and thrombogenesis. H2S also decreases plasma homocysteine levels in experimental animal models. In the human body, H2S production is predominantly catalyzed by cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). CSE is the primary H2S-producing enzyme in the vasculature. Growing evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is associated with vascular CSE/H2S deficiency and that H2S supplementation by exogenous H2S donors (such as NaHS and GYY4137) attenuates, and H2S synthesis suppression by inhibitors (such as D, L-propargylglycine) aggravates the development of atherosclerotic plaques. However, it remains elusive whether CSE deficiency plays a causative role in atherosclerosis. A recent study (Circulation. 2013; 127: 2523-2534) demonstrates that decreased endogenous H2S production by CSE genetic deletion accelerates atherosclerosis in athero-prone ApoE-/- mice, pinpointing that endogenously produced H2S by CSE activation may be of benefit in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. This study will facilitate the development of H2S-based pharmaceuticals with therapeutic applications in atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases.

Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is the main contributor to the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the brain. Exogenously administered H2S has been reported to protect neurons against hypoxic injury, ischemia and LPS-induced neuro-inflammation and in the facilitating of long term potentiation (LTP). Dysregulation of CBS leads to different diseases, which all have mental retardation in common. Although multiple studies have implicated a link between the CBS/H2S pathway and neurodegeneration, no studies have been performed examining the pathway in healthy aging animals. We hypothesize that CBS/H2S pathway plays an important role in the protection of learning and memory functions in the brain at the level of the hippocampus. Thus, we studied a set of 8 young (4 months) and 14 aged (24 months (n=6) and 28 months (n=8)) C57Bl6 mice. The 24-month-old mice displayed a significant decrease of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG only, compared to 4-month-old mice. In 28-month-old mice, we observed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity in the MoDG, compared to 4-month-old mice. When comparing 28-month-old mice to 24-month-old mice, all areas showed a significant increase of CBS immunoreactivity. Thus, throughout aging, CBS expression is maintained in the hippocampus, and many other forebrain regions as well. Mice at the unusual age of 28 months even have a higher hippocampal CBS expression than young mice. Maintenance (and increase) of CBS levels may sustain memory and learning by precluding neuronal loss in areas of the hippocampus.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been considered to be a physiological mediator since the identification of endogenous sulfides in the mammalian brain. H2S is produced from L-cysteine by enzymes such as cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). CSE and CAT are regulated by Ca(2+). At steady-state low intracellular concentrations of Ca(2+), CSE and the 3MST/CAT pathway produce H2S. However, after intracellular concentrations of Ca(2+) increase in stimulated cells, the production of H2S by these enzymes decreases. We recently identified a fourth pathway, by which H2S is produced from D-cysteine by the enzymes D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) and 3MST. This pathway is mainly localized in the cerebellum and the kidney. The production of H2S from D-cysteine is 80 times more efficient than that from L-cysteine in the kidney, and the administration of D-cysteine to mice ameliorates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury more effectively than L-cysteine. These results suggest that D-cysteine might be used to treat renal diseases or even increase the success of kidney transplantation. We found that H2S-derived polysulfides exist in the brain and activate transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) channels 300 times more potently than H2S. Although TRPA1 channels mediate sensory transduction and respond to a variety of stimuli, including cold temperature, pungent compounds and environmental irritants, their endogenous ligand(s) has not been identified. The sulfane sulfur of polysulfides is a reactive electrophile that is readily transferred to a nucleophilic protein thiolate to generate the protein persulfide or bound sulfane sulfur by sulfhydration (as referred to as sulfuration). The bound sulfane sulfur-producing activity of polysulfides is much greater than that of H2S. This review focuses on the physiological roles of H2S and H2S-derived polysulfides as signaling molecules.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gaseotransmitter/modulator, is becoming appreciated that it may be involved in a wide variety of processes including inflammation and nociception. However, the role for H2S in nociceptive processing in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neuron remains unknown. The aim of this study was designed to investigate whether endogenous H2S synthesizing enzyme cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS) plays a role in inflammatory pain in temporomandibular joint (TMJ).METHODS: TMJ inflammatory pain was induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into TMJ of adult male rats. Von Frey filaments were used to examine pain behavioral responses in rats following injection of CFA or normal saline (NS). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were employed on acutely isolated TG neurons from rats 2 days after CFA injection. Western blot analysis was carried out to measure protein expression in TGs.RESULTS: Injection of CFA into TMJ produced a time dependent hyperalgesia as evidenced by reduced escape threshold in rats responding to VFF stimulation. The reduced escape threshold was partially reversed by injection of O-(Carboxymethyl) hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (AOAA), an inhibitor for CBS, in a dose-dependent manner. CFA injection led to a marked upregulation of CBS expression when compared with age-matched controls. CFA injection enhanced neuronal excitability as evidenced by depolarization of resting membrane potentials, reduction in rheobase, and an increase in number of action potentials evoked by 2 and 3 times rheobase current stimulation and by a ramp current stimulation of TG neurons innervating the TMJ area. CFA injection also led to a reduction of IK but not IA current density of TG neurons. Application of AOAA in TMJ area reduced the production of H2S in TGs and reversed the enhanced neural hyperexcitability and increased the IK currents of TG neurons.CONCLUSION: These data together with our previous report indicate that endogenous H2S generating enzyme CBS plays an important role in TMJ inflammation, which is likely mediated by inhibition of IK currents, thus identifying a specific molecular mechanism underlying pain and sensitization in TMJ inflammation.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the most widely used analgesic antipyretic drugs and is a major cause of acute liver failure at overdose. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible protective effect of a-lipoic acid (a-LA, 20 or 100 mg/kg administered simultaneously or after 1.5 h) against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Administration of APAP (1.5 g/kg i.p.) resulted in elevation of serum ALT and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content, as well as decrease in hepatic glutathione (GSH) content. In addition, elevation in hepatic hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH oxidase expression was observed accompanied with a significant reduction in glutathione synthase and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CßS) expression. Furthermore, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-<U+03BA>B) activity was enhanced in APAP-treated rats. Administration of the standard APAP antidote; N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 1200 mg/kg) or a-LA (20 mg/kg), simultaneously or 1.5 h after APAP, ameliorated APAP-induced alterations in liver function, oxidant and inflammatory markers. Importantly, simultaneous administration of NAC or a-LA (20 mg/kg) was more protective than their later administration. However, the beneficial effect of a-LA was lost at higher dose level (100 mg/kg). Taken together, the beneficial effects of a-lipoic acid (20 mg/kg) were comparable to those of NAC which provides a new possible treatment for APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in patients who cannot tolerate NAC. However, careful dose selection is warranted since the beneficial effects of a-LA were lost at higher doses.

INTRODUCTION: Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCLP) is a common birth defect with substantial clinical and social impact. Folate deficiency is one of the factors that have been associated with increased risk for NSCLP. Polymorphisms in folate and homocysteine pathway genes may act as susceptibility factors.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate prevalence estimates of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) insertion of 68-bp (c.844ins68) polymorphisms and their correlation with NSCLP.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 236 unrelated individuals from seven Indian populations and an additional 355 cases with NSCLP and 357 controls without NSCLP were included in this study. We investigated the CBS c.844ins68 polymorphism in all samples. Genotyping was performed with polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis. The data were statistically analyzed using the chi-square test.RESULTS: The CBS c.844ins68 allele is present in six of the seven populations analyzed, and allele frequencies range from 1.5% in Balija to 9.1% in Sugali populations. The CBS c.844ins68 polymorphism showed a significant protective effect on NSCLP at both genotype (WW versus WI: odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31 to 0.95, P = .149) and allele levels (W versus I: OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.96, P = .033).CONCLUSIONS: The current study observed significant differences in the frequency of the CBS 844ins68 allele across populations. There is a significant association between CBS c.844ins68 polymorphism and cleft lip and palate in the Indian population. Additional studies are warranted to identify the functional variants in the genes controlling homocysteine as etiological contributors to the formation of oral clefts.

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) acts as an endogenous neuromodulator and neuroprotectant. It has been shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in the pathological mechanisms of the learning and memory dysfunctions and that H2S exerts its neuroprotective role via suppressing ER stress. In the present work, we explored the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of Hcy on the formation of learning and memory, the generation of endogenous H2S, and the expression of ER stress in the hippocampus of rats. We found that intracerebroventricular injection of Hcy in rats leads to learning and memory dysfunctions in the Morris water maze and novel of object recognition test and decreases in the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase, the major enzyme responsible for endogenous H2S generation, and the generation of endogenous H2S in the hippocampus of rats. We also showed that exposure of Hcy could up-regulate the expressions of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CHOP, and cleaved caspase-12, which are the major mark proteins of ER stress, in the hippocampus of rats. Taken together, these results suggest that the disturbance of hippocampal endogenous H2S generation and the increase in ER stress in the hippocampus are related to Hcy-induced defect in learning and memory.

Nitrite was recognized as a potent vasodilator &gt;130 years and has more recently emerged as an endogenous signaling molecule and modulator of gene expression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate nitrite metabolism is essential for its use as a potential diagnostic marker as well as therapeutic agent for cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we have identified human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) as a new player in nitrite reduction with implications for the nitrite-dependent control of H2S production. This novel activity of CBS exploits the catalytic property of its unusual heme cofactor to reduce nitrite and generate NO. Evidence for the possible physiological relevance of this reaction is provided by the formation of ferrous-nitrosyl (Fe(II)-NO) CBS in the presence of NADPH, the human diflavin methionine synthase reductase (MSR) and nitrite. Formation of Fe(II)-NO CBS via its nitrite reductase activity inhibits CBS, providing an avenue for regulating biogenesis of H2S and cysteine, the limiting reagent for synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant. Our results also suggest a possible role for CBS in intracellular NO biogenesis particularly under hypoxic conditions. The participation of a regulatory heme cofactor in CBS in nitrite reduction is unexpected and expands the repertoire of proteins that can liberate NO from the intracellular nitrite pool. Our results reveal a potential molecular mechanism for cross-talk between nitrite, NO and H2S biology.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is necessary for the synthesis of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine, which is necessary for CNS (re-)myelination. The MTHFR variant c.1298A&gt;C was associated with the development of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in a German population. This study aimed at analyzing whether further genetic variants of methionine metabolism are associated with the development or the clinical course of RRMS. Therefore, genomic DNA of 147 serial German RRMS patients and 147 matched healthy controls was genotyped for five polymorphic variants of methionine metabolism. Statistical analyses were performed using multivariate binary and linear regression analyses. We show that the insertion allele of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) c.844_855ins68bp and the G-allele of reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) c.80G&gt;A were associated with an earlier age of onset of MS, suggesting gene-dose effects (median age of onset in years: 25-26-32; standardized regression coefficient beta: 0.216; p=0.030, and 29-31-35 years; beta: 0.282; p=0.005, respectively). Conclusively, mutant variants of CBS and RFC1 may be associated with the age of RRMS onset. Since methionine metabolism can be manipulated by supplementation of vitamins and amino acids, our data provide a rationale for novel ideas of preventive and therapeutic strategies in RRMS.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined both by its progressive cognitive deterioration and hallmark increase in neuronal Aß plaque formation. However, many of the underlying neurobiological facets of this disease are still being elucidated. Previous research has demonstrated that production of neuronal hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is significantly decreased in patients with AD. Moreover, systemic plasma H2S levels are negatively correlated with its severity. However, how a decrease in H2S production might be correlated with either the etiology or pathophysiology of AD remains unknown. To better understand the role of H2S in AD, we examined both levels of H2S and the expression and activity H2S-synthesizing enzyme (cystathionine beta synthase or CBS) in an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse line at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of an H2S donor (NaHS) into APP/PS1 mice, application of exogenous H2S resulted in improved spatial learning and memory acquisition in APP/PS1 mice. H2S administration also led to significant decrease in extracellular levels of Aß40 and Aß42, the expression of BACE1 and PS1, and a significant increase of ADAM17 expression. Similarly, an increase in non-amyloidogenic C83 fragment generation and a decrease in amyloidogenic C99 fragment generation were also observed. Thus, NaHS application resulted in a shift from the plaque-forming beta pathway to the non-plaque forming alpha pathway of APP cleavage in 6 and 12 month APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate the importance of H2S to AD severity and that administration of exogenous H2S can promote a non-amyloidogenic processing of APP.

Leishmania parasites seem capable of producing cysteine by de novo biosynthesis, similarly to bacteria, some pathogenic protists, and plants. In Leishmania spp., cysteine synthase (CS) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) are expected to participate in this metabolic process. Moreover, the reverse transsulfuration pathway (RTP) is also predicted to be operative in this trypanosomatid because CBS also catalyzes the condensation of serine with homocysteine, and a gene encoding a putative cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) is present in all the sequenced genomes. Our results show that indeed, Leishmania major CGL is able to rescue the wild-type phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae CGL-null mutant and is susceptible to inhibition by an irreversible CGL inhibitor, DL-propargylglycine (PAG). In Leishmania promastigotes, CGL and CS are cytosolic enzymes. The coexistence of de novo synthesis with the RTP is extremely rare in most living organisms; however, despite this potentially high redundancy in cysteine production, PAG arrests the proliferation of L. major promastigotes with an IC50 of approximately 65 µM. These findings raise new questions regarding the biological role of CGL in these pathogens and indicate the need for understanding the molecular mechanism of PAG action in vivo to identify the potential targets affected by this drug.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes and particularly high blood glucose levels are implicated in neurodegeneration. One of the hallmarks of neurodegeneration is protein aggregation. We investigated the presence of protein aggregation in the frontal brain of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, an animal model for diabetes. Further, the effect of NaHS in suppressing protein aggregation in cultured brain slices from ZDF was assessed.RESULTS: The levels of protein synthesis, protein/gene expression, autophagy and anti-oxidant defense were evaluated in ZDF and control (Lean) brains.Compared to Lean, ZDF brains displayed a significant increase in protein aggregates, p-tau, fibronectin expression and protein glycosylation. Increased phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 ribosomal protein in ZDF indicated higher protein synthesis, while the increase in ubiquitinated proteins and LC3-I in ZDF brains accompanied by lower LC3-II expression and LC3-II/LC3-I levels indicated the blockage of proteolytic pathways. CBS (cystathionine beta synthase) protein and mRNA expression and thiol group levels in ZDF brains were lower compared to Lean. ZDF brains show a higher level of reactive oxygen species. In vitro NaHS treatment normalized proteostasis while counteracting oxidative stress.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate increased protein synthesis and aggregation in the diabetic ZDF rat brain, which was reversible by NaHS treatment.This is the first report on the potential use of NaHS as a novel strategy against protein aggregation in diabetic brain.

Earlier studies have shown that betaine administration may modulate the metabolism of sulfur amino acids in the liver. In this study, we determined the changes in the metabolomics of sulfur-containing substances induced by betaine in the kidney, the other major organ actively involved in the transsulfuration reactions. Male rats received betaine (1%) in drinking water for 2 weeks before killing. Betaine intake did not affect betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase activity or its protein expression in the renal tissue. Expression of methionine synthase was also unchanged. However, methionine levels were increased significantly both in plasma and kidney. Renal methionine adenosyltransferase activity and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations were increased, but there were no changes in S-adenosylhomocysteine, homocysteine, cysteine levels or cystathionine ß-synthase expression. <U+03B3>-Glutamylcysteine synthetase expression or glutathione levels were not altered, but cysteine dioxygenase and taurine levels were decreased significantly. In contrast, betaine administration induced cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase and its metabolic product, hypotaurine. These results indicate that the metabolomics of sulfur-containing substances in the kidney is altered extensively by betaine, although the renal capacity for methionine synthesis is unresponsive to this substance unlike that of the liver. It is suggested that the increased methionine availability due to an enhancement of its uptake from plasma may account for the alterations in the metabolomics of sulfur-containing substances in the kidney. Further studies need to be conducted to clarify the physiological/pharmacological significance of these findings.

Elevated homocysteine is an important risk factor that increases cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease morbidity. In mammals, B vitamin supplementation can reduce homocysteine levels. Whether, and how, hibernating mammals, that essentially stop ingesting B vitamins, maintain homocysteine metabolism and avoid cerebrovascular impacts and neurodegeneration remain unclear. Here, we compare homocysteine levels in the brains of torpid bats, active bats and rats to identify the molecules involved in homocysteine homeostasis. We found that homocysteine does not elevate in torpid brains, despite declining vitamin B levels. At low levels of vitamin B6 and B12, we found no change in total expression level of the two main enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism (methionine synthase and cystathionine ß-synthase), but a 1.85-fold increase in the expression of the coenzyme-independent betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT). BHMT expression was observed in the amygdala of basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex where BHMT levels were clearly elevated during torpor. This is the first report of BHMT protein expression in the brain and suggests that BHMT modulates homocysteine in the brains of hibernating bats. BHMT may have a neuroprotective role in the brains of hibernating mammals and further research on this system could expand our biomedical understanding of certain cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease processes.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been shown to play an important role in the digestive system, but the role of endogenous H2S produced locally in the gallbladder is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether gallbladder possesses the enzymatic machinery to synthesize H2S, and whether H2S synthesis is changed in gallbladder inflammation during acute acalculous cholecystitis (AC).METHODS: Adult male guinea pigs underwent either a sham operation or common bile duct ligation (CBDL). One, two, or three days after CBDL, the animals were sacrificed separately. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of gallbladder samples were scored for inflammation. H2S production rate in gallbladder tissue from each group was determined; immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to determine expression levels of the H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in gallbladder.RESULTS: There was a progressive inflammatory response after CBDL. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that CBS and CSE were expressed in the gallbladder epithelium, muscular layer, and blood vessels and that the expression increased progressively with increasing inflammation following CBDL. The expression of CBS protein as well as the H2S-production rate was significantly increased in the animals that underwent CBDL, compared to those that underwent the sham operation.CONCLUSIONS: Both CBS and CSE are expressed in gallbladder tissues. The expression of these enzymes, as well as H2S synthesis, was up-regulated in the context of inflammation during AC.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: H2 S induces vasodilatation by opening KATP channels but it may also affect other ion channels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of H2 S on intestinal motility in rats and its underlying mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The tension of intestinal muscle strips, afferent firing of intestinal mesenteric nerves, length of duodenal smooth muscle cells and whole-cell membrane potential of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were monitored. H2 S-producing enzymes were located by immunofluorescence staining.KEY RESULTS: NaHS exerted early transient excitation and late long-lasting inhibition on the intestinal contraction. The excitation was attenuated by TRPV1 antagonists capsazepine, A784168, SB-366791 and NK1 receptor antagonist L703606, while the inhibition was attenuated by glibenclamide. NaHS increased duodenal afferent nerve firing and depolarized DRG neurons. These effects were reduced by capsazepine and A784168. NaHS relaxed isolated duodenal smooth muscle cells. The KATP channels were expressed in smooth muscle cells. Cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase were expressed in rat duodenal myenteric neurons. L-cysteine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine increased the contraction of duodenal muscle strips, an effect attenuated by capsazepine and L703606.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: NaHS induces biphasic effects on intestinal motility in rats while endogenous H2 S only exerts an excitatory effect. This transient excitatory effect might be mediated by activation of TRPV1 channels in sensory nerve terminals with the consequent release of substance P. The long-lasting inhibitory effect might be mediated by activation of KATP channels in the smooth muscle cells. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for the excitatory effect of H2 S on gastrointestinal motility.

Increased catalytic activity of CBS (cystathionine ß-synthase) was recently shown to mediate vasodilation of the cerebral microcirculation, which is initiated within minutes of the onset of acute hypoxia. To test whether chronic hypoxia was a stimulus for increased CBS expression, U87-MG human glioblastoma and PC12 rat phaeochromocytoma cells were exposed to 1% or 20% O2 for 24-72 h. CBS mRNA and protein expression were increased in hypoxic cells. Hypoxic induction of CBS expression was abrogated in cells transfected with vector encoding shRNA targeting HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) 1a or 2a. Exposure of rats to hypobaric hypoxia (0.35 atm; 1 atm=101.325 kPa) for 3 days induced increased CBS mRNA, protein and catalytic activity in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, which was blocked by administration of the HIF inhibitor digoxin. HIF-binding sites, located 0.8 and 1.2 kb 5' to the transcription start site of the human CBS and rat Cbs genes respectively, were identified by ChIP assays. A 49-bp human sequence, which encompassed an inverted repeat of the core HIF-binding site, functioned as a hypoxia-response element in luciferase reporter transcription assays. Thus HIFs mediate tissue-specific CBS expression, which may augment cerebral vasodilation as an adaptive response to chronic hypoxia.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associate with clinical phenotypes, but these SNPs usually explain just a small part of the heritability and have relatively modest effect sizes. In contrast, SNPs that associate with metabolite levels generally explain a higher percentage of the genetic variation and demonstrate larger effect sizes. Still, the discovery of SNPs associated with metabolite levels is challenging since testing all metabolites measured in typical metabolomics studies with all SNPs comes with a severe multiple testing penalty. We have developed an automated workflow approach that utilizes prior knowledge of biochemical pathways present in databases like KEGG and BioCyc to generate a smaller SNP set relevant to the metabolite. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in the analysis of GWAS of metabolomic phenotypes and provides novel insights into the genetic basis of metabolic variation through the re-analysis of published GWAS datasets.RESULTS: Re-analysis of the published GWAS dataset from Illig et al. (Nature Genetics, 2010) using a pathway-based workflow (http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/319.html), confirmed previously identified hits and identified a new locus of human metabolic individuality, associating Aldehyde dehydrogenase family1 L1 (ALDH1L1) with serine/glycine ratios in blood. Replication in an independent GWAS dataset of phospholipids (Demirkan et al., PLoS Genetics, 2012) identified two novel loci supported by additional literature evidence: GPAM (Glycerol-3 phosphate acyltransferase) and CBS (Cystathionine beta-synthase). In addition, the workflow approach provided novel insight into the affected pathways and relevance of some of these gene-metabolite pairs in disease development and progression.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of automated exploitation of background knowledge present in pathway databases for the analysis of GWAS datasets of metabolomic phenotypes. We report novel loci and potential biochemical mechanisms that contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic variation and its relationship to disease development and progression.

OBJECTIVE: Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) 844ins68 polymorphism has been implicated in the development of neural tube defects (NTDs). However, the results of different studies are inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to further investigate this association.METHODS: Published studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data. Studies that evaluated the association between CBS 844ins68 polymorphism and NTD risk among mothers, children, or fathers were included. The pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence interval were calculated using a fixed effects model or a random effects model.RESULTS: A total of eight studies on mothers (641 cases and 1145 controls), eight studies on children (852 cases and 1912 controls), and five studies (263 cases and 1562 controls) on fathers were included. The meta-analysis revealed no significant association between CBS 844ins68 polymorphism and NTD risk among mothers, children, and fathers under either genetic model.CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis indicates that CBS 844ins68 polymorphism is not a good predictor of risk for NTDs.



#### Activation of transsulfuration pathway by salvianolic acid a treatment: a homocysteine-lowering approach with beneficial effects on redox homeostasis in high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats.

BACKGROUND: Elevated homocysteine is a cardiovascular risk factor in hyperlipidemia. Transsulfuration pathway provides an endogenous pathway for homocysteine conversion to antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Salvianolic acid A (Sal A) contains two molecules of caffeic acid and one molecule of danshensu that is capable of enhancing homocysteine transsulfuration, which led to the hypothesis that Sal A has activatory effect on transsulfuration pathway and this effect may have beneficial effects on both homocysteine and redox status in hyperlipidemia.METHODS AND RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, we developed a rat model of hyperlipidemia induced by high-fat diet for 16 weeks, during which rats were treated with 1 mg/kg salvianolic acid A (Sal A) for the final 4 weeks. Activities of key enzymes and metabolite profiling in the transsulfuration pathway revealed that hyperlipidemia led to elevated plasma homocysteine levels after 16-week dietary treatment, which was associated with reduced activities of homocysteine transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). The impaired transsulfuration pathway prevented homocysteine transsulfuration to cysteine, resulting in cysteine deficiency and subsequent reduction in GSH pool size. The redox status was altered in the setting of hyperlipidemia as indicated by GSH/GSSG ratio. Sal A treatment increased hepatic CBS and CSE activities, which was associated with reduced accumulation in circulating homocysteine levels and attenuated decline in hepatic cysteine content in hyperlipidemic rats. Sal A also led to an increase in GSH pool size, which subsequently caused a restored GSH/GSSG ratio. The activatory effect of Sal A on CBS was also observed in normal rats and in in vitro experiment.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that activation of transsulfuration pathway by Sal A is a promising homocysteine-lowering approach that has beneficial effects on redox homeostasis in hyperlipidemic settings.

Down syndrome (DS), also known as Trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome aneuploidy in live-born children and displays a complicated symptom. To date, several kinds of mouse models have been generated to understand the molecular pathology of DS, yet the gene dosage effects and gene(s)-phenotype(s) correlation are not well understood. In this study, we established a novel method to generate a partial trisomy mice using the mouse ES cells that harbor a single copy of human artificial chromosome (HAC), into which a small human DNA segment containing human chromosome 21 genes cloned in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) was recombined. The produced mice were found to maintain the HAC carrying human genes as a mini-chromosome, hence termed as a Trans-Mini-Chromosomal (TMC) mouse, and HAC was transmitted for more than twenty generations independent from endogenous mouse chromosomes. The three human transgenes including cystathionine ß-synthase, U2 auxiliary factor and crystalline alpha A were expressed in several mouse tissues with various expression levels relative to mouse endogenous genes. The novel system is applicable to any of human and/or mouse BAC clones. Thus, the TMC mouse carrying a HAC with a limited number of genes would provide a novel tool for studying gene dosage effects involved in the DS molecular pathogenesis and the gene(s)-phenotype(s) correlation.

A protocol for the identification of N-homocysteinylation sites in plasma proteins is described. Human plasma or purified fibrinogen is subjected to trypsin digestion and analysis of N-Hcy-peptides by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS). Human fibrinogen is isolated from the plasma by the glycine precipitation method. Identification of N-Hcy-Lys-peptides in tryptic digests of in vivo-derived samples is facilitated by the use of N-Hcy-albumin and N-Hcy-fibrinogen synthesized in vitro from commercially available human proteins. This protocol allows identification of N-homocysteinylation sites at Lys4, Lys12, Lys137, and Lys525 in albumin directly in trypsin-digested human serum samples. N-Hcy-Lys562, N-Hcy-Lys344, and N-Hcy-Lys385 were identified in human fibrinogen from patients with cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency. The protocol can be completed in 4 days.

Cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-cystathionine (l-Cth), producing l-cysteine (l-Cys), a-ketobutyrate and ammonia, in the second step of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which converts l-homocysteine (l-Hcys) to l-Cys. Site-directed variants substituting residues E48 and E333 with alanine, aspartate and glutamine were characterized to probe the roles of these acidic residues, conserved in fungal and mammalian CGL sequences, in the active-site of CGL from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yCGL). The pH optimum of variants containing the alanine or glutamine substitutions of E333 is increased by 0.4-1.2 pH units, likely due to repositioning of the cofactor and modification of the pKa of the pyridinium nitrogen. The pH profile of yCGL-E48A/E333A resembles that of Escherichia coli cystathionine ß-lyase. The effect of substituting E48, E333 or both residues is the 1.3-3, 26-58 and 124-568-fold reduction, respectively, of the catalytic efficiency of l-Cth hydrolysis. The Km(l-Cth) of E333 substitution variants is increased ~17-fold, while Km(l-OAS) is within 2.5-fold of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that residue E333 interacts with the distal amine moiety of l-Cth, which is not present in the alternative substrate O-acetyl-l-serine. The catalytic efficiency of yCGL for a,<U+03B3>-elimination of O-succinyl-l-homoserine (kcat/Km(l-OSHS)=7±2), which possesses a distal carboxylate, but lacks an amino group, is 300-fold lower than that of the physiological l-Cth substrate (kcat/Km(l-Cth)=2100±100) and 260-fold higher than that of l-Hcys (kcat/Km(l-Hcys)=0.027±0.005), which lacks both distal polar moieties. The results of this study suggest that the glutamate residue at position 333 is a determinant of specificity.

Hydrogen sulfide has recently been found decreased in chronic kidney disease. Here we determined the effect and underlying mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide on a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction. Compared with normal rats, obstructive injury decreased the plasma hydrogen sulfide level. Cystathionine-ß-synthase, a hydrogen sulfide-producing enzyme, was dramatically reduced in the ureteral obstructed kidney, but another enzyme cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase was increased. A hydrogen sulfide donor (sodium hydrogen sulfide) inhibited renal fibrosis by attenuating the production of collagen, extracellular matrix, and the expression of a-smooth muscle actin. Meanwhile, the infiltration of macrophages and the expression of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1ß, tumor necrosis factor-a, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the kidney were also decreased. In cultured kidney fibroblasts, a hydrogen sulfide donor inhibited the cell proliferation by reducing DNA synthesis and downregulating the expressions of proliferation-related proteins including proliferating cell nuclear antigen and c-Myc. Further, the hydrogen sulfide donor blocked the differentiation of quiescent renal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by inhibiting the transforming growth factor-ß1-Smad and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Thus, low doses of hydrogen sulfide or its releasing compounds may have therapeutic potentials in treating chronic kidney disease.

Chronic exposure to high glucose induces the expression of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), a hydrogen sulfide-producing enzyme, in pancreatic beta-cells, thereby suppressing apoptosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of hydrogen sulfide on the onset and development of type 2 diabetes. Middle-aged (6-month-old) wild-type (WT) and CSE knockout (CSE-KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8weeks. We determined the effects of CSE knockout on beta-cell function and mass in islets from these mice. We also analyzed changes in gene expression in the islets. After 8weeks of HFD, blood glucose levels were markedly increased in middle-aged CSE-KO mice, insulin responses were significantly reduced, and DNA fragmentation of the islet cells was increased. Moreover, expression of thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2, also known as Txnip) was increased. Administration of NaHS, a hydrogen sulfide donor, reduced TBP-2 gene levels in isolated islets from CSE-KO mice. Gene levels were elevated when islets were treated with the CSE inhibitor dl-propargylglycine (PPG). These results provide evidence that CSE-produced hydrogen sulfide protects beta-cells from glucotoxicity via regulation of TBP-2 expression levels and thus prevents the onset/development of type 2 diabetes.

In acute neuronal insult events, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, pathological processes of secondary neuronal injury play a key role in the severity of insult and clinical prognosis. Along with nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is regarded as the third gasotransmitter and endogenous neuromodulator and plays multiple roles in the central nervous system under physiological and pathological states, especially in secondary neuronal injury. The endogenous level of H2S in the brain is significantly higher than that in peripheral tissues, and is mainly formed by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) in astrocytes and released in response to neuronal excitation. The mechanism of secondary neuronal injury exacerbating the damage caused by the initial insult includes microcirculation failure, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, neuronal apoptosis and calcium overload. H2S dilates cerebral vessels by activating smooth muscle cell plasma membrane ATP-sensitive K channels (KATP channels). This modification occurs on specific cysteine residues of the KATP channel proteins which are S-sulfhydrated. H2S counteracts glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity by inducing astrocytes to intake more glutamate from the extracellular space and thus increasing glutathione in neurons. In addition, H2S protects neurons from secondary neuronal injury by functioning as an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mediator. However, there are still some reports suggest that H2S elevates neuronal Ca(2+) concentration and may contribute to the formation of calcium overload in secondary neuronal injury. H2S also elicits calcium waves in primary cultures of astrocytes and may mediate signals between neurons and glia. Consequently, further exploration of the molecular mechanisms of H2S in secondary neuronal injury will provide important insights into its potential therapeutic uses for the treatment of acute neuronal insult events.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths. Most patients respond initially to platinum-based chemotherapy after surgical debulking, however relapse is very common and ultimately platinum resistance emerges. Understanding the mechanism of tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistant relapse will profoundly impact the therapeutic management of ovarian cancer.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using patient tissue microarray (TMA), in vitro and in vivo studies we report a role of of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), a sulfur metabolism enzyme in ovarian carcinoma. We report here that the expression of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), a sulfur metabolism enzyme, is common in primary serous ovarian carcinoma. The in vitro effects of CBS silencing can be reversed by exogenous supplementation with the GSH and H2S producing chemical Na2S. Silencing CBS in a cisplatin resistant orthotopic model in vivo by nanoliposomal delivery of CBS siRNA inhibits tumor growth, reduces nodule formation and sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. The effects were further corroborated by immunohistochemistry that demonstrates a reduction of H&amp;E, Ki-67 and CD31 positive cells in si-RNA treated as compared to scrambled-RNA treated animals. Furthermore, CBS also regulates bioenergetics of ovarian cancer cells by regulating mitochondrial ROS production, oxygen consumption and ATP generation. This study reports an important role of CBS in promoting ovarian tumor growth and maintaining drug resistant phenotype by controlling cellular redox behavior and regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics.CONCLUSION: The present investigation highlights CBS as a potential therapeutic target in relapsed and platinum resistant ovarian cancer.

Classical homocystinuria is the most commonly inherited disorder of sulfur metabolism, caused by the genetic alterations in human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. In this study, we present comprehensive clinical findings and the genetic basis of homocystinuria in a cohort of Turkish patients. Excluding some CBS mutations, detailed genotype-phenotype correlation for different CBS mutations has not been established in literature. We aimed to make clinical subgroups according to main clinical symptoms and discussed these data together with mutational analysis results from our patients. Totally, 16 different mutations were identified; twelve of which had already been reported, and four are novel (p.N93Y, p.L251P, p.D281V and c.829-2A&gt;T). The probands were classified into three major groups according to the clinical symptoms caused by these mutations. A psychomotor delay was the most common diagnostic symptom (n=12, 46.2% neurological presentation), followed by thromboembolic events (n=6, 23.1% vascular presentation) and lens ectopia, myopia or marfanoid features (n=5, 19.2% connective tissue presentation). Pyridoxine responsiveness was 7.7%; however, with partial responsive probands, the ratio was 53.9%. In addition, five thrombophilic nucleotide changes including MTHFR c.677 C&gt;T and c.1298 A&gt;C, Factor V c.1691 G&gt;A, Factor II c.20210 G&gt;A, and SERPINE1 4G/5G were investigated to assess their contributions to the clinical spectrum. We suggest that the effect of these polymorphisms on clinical phenotype of CBS is not very clear since the distribution of thrombophilic polymorphisms does not differ among specific groups. This study provides molecular findings of 26 Turkish probands with homocystinuria and discusses the clinical presentations and putative effects of the CBS mutations.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by elevated serum total homocysteine (tHcy). Previously, our laboratory developed a mouse model of CBS deficiency, TgI278T Cbs(-)/(-) (abbreviated as Cbs(-/-)), characterized by low weight, low adiposity, decreased Scd-1 expression, facial alopecia, and osteoporosis. To determine the potential benefit of a methionine-restricted diet (MRD), we fed Cbs(-/-) and Cbs(+/-) control mice either an MRD or a regular diet (RD) from weaning till 240 d of age. Cbs(-/-) mice fed the MRD had a 77% decrease in tHcy, 28% increase in weight, 130% increase in fat mass, 82% increase in Scd-1 expression, and 10.6% increase in bone density and entirely lacked the alopecia phenotype observed in age-matched Cbs(-/-) mice fed the RD. At the end of the study, Cbs(-/-) mice fed the MRD were phenotypically indistinguishable from Cbs(+/-) mice fed the RD. Notably, whereas the MRD diet was highly beneficial to Cbs(-/-) mice, it had nearly opposite effect on Cbs(+/-) mice. These studies show that a low-methionine diet can correct the phenotypic consequences of loss of CBS and provide a striking example of how genotype and diet can interact to influence phenotype in mammals.

BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency is most often diagnosed in childhood and has a variable expressivity. The most frequent abnormalities include intellectual disability, ectopia lentis, myopia, skeletal abnormalities or thromboembolism.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of homocystinuria unraveled by cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).OBSERVATION: A 17 year old female was admitted in our department of neurology for subacute headache and presented seizures in the emergency room. Cerebral imaging revealed CVT. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia was found and led to the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to composite heterozygous mutations in the CBS gene. Further investigations disclosed lens subluxation in association with myopia, mild scoliosis and osteopenia. The patient was treated by heparin followed by warfarin, vitamin therapy and dietary methionine restriction. Total homocysteine and methionine levels became normal in a few weeks and the patient had a complete recovery.CONCLUSION: In patients with CVT, plasma total homocysteine measurement as part of the etiologic work up may reveal severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to CBS or remethylation defects that require specific treatment and management including perhaps protein-restricted diet and/or vitamin therapy for life.

INTRODUCTION: Treatment with B-vitamins and betaine reduces the high risk of thrombosis in patients with homocystinuria, a metabolic syndrome that is characterized by severe hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). In contrast, there is no clear demonstration that B-vitamins reduce the risk of thrombosis in patients with mild HHcy: for this reason, many question the clinical utility of measuring total Hcy (tHcy) in patients with thrombosis. However, thrombosis may be the first clinical manifestation of homocystinuria in patients reaching adulthood without signs and symptoms of the syndrome.AIM: 1) to measure the prevalence of severe, previously undiagnosed, HHcy among patients with thrombosis 2) to profile these patients on the basis of their characteristics.METHODS: Six Italian Thrombosis Centers completed a first questionnaire, reporting tHcy levels in patients with thrombosis who underwent thrombophilia screening, and a second questionnaire, reporting the characteristics of patients with severe HHcy (tHcy&gt;100µmol/L).RESULTS: Of 19,678 cross-sectionally collected patients with thrombosis who underwent thrombophilia screening in the last 12.5years (median value, range 6-17), 38 had severe HHcy (0.2%). Their median age at diagnosis was 47years (range 19-83) and the median level of tHcy was 130µmol/L (range 101-262). Venous thromboembolism (71%) was more frequent than arterial thromboembolism (26%); recurrent thrombosis occurred in 42% of cases.CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of tHcy in adult patients with thrombosis may reveal the presence of severe HHcy. Since treatment of patients with severe HHcy decreases the risk of thrombosis, measurement of tHcy in patients with thrombosis may prove clinically useful.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains or CBS motifs are conserved structural domains that are present in thousands of non functionally-related proteins from all kingdoms of life. Their importance is underlined by the range of hereditary diseases associated with mutations in their amino acid sequence. CBS motifs associate in pairs referred to as Bateman modules. In contrast with initial assumptions, it is now well documented that CBS motifs and/or Bateman modules may suffer conformational changes upon binding of adenosine derivatives, metal ions or nucleic acids. The degree and direction of these structural changes depend on the type of ligand, the intrinsic features of the binding sites and the association manner of the Bateman modules. This review aims to provide a summary of the current knowledge on the structural basis of ligand recognition and on the structural effects caused by these ligands in CBS domain containing proteins.

NO and H2S are gaseous signaling molecules that modulate smooth muscle motility. We aimed to identify expressions of enzymes that catalyze H2S and NO generation in mouse gastric smooth muscle, and determine relationships between endogenous H2S and NO in regulation of smooth muscle motility. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry methods were used to track expressions of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in gastric smooth muscles. Smooth muscle motility was recorded by isometric force transducers. cGMP production was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. We found that CBS, CSE, eNOS, and nNOS were all expressed in mice gastric antral smooth muscle tissues, and in cultured gastric antral smooth muscle cells. AOAA significantly inhibited smooth muscle contractions in the gastric antrum, which was significantly recovered by NaHS, while PAG had no significant effect. l-NAME enhanced contractions. NaHS at low concentrations increased basal tension but decreased it at high concentrations. SNP significantly inhibited the contractions, which could be recovered by NaHS both in the absence and presence of CuSO4. ODQ did not block NaHS-induced excitatory effect, while IBMX partially blocked this effect. cGMP production in smooth muscle was significantly increased by SNP but was not affected by NaHS. All these results suggest that endogenous H2S and NO appear to play opposite roles in regulating gastric motility and their effects may be via separate signal transduction pathways. Intracellular H2S/NO levels may be maintained in a state of balance to warrant normal smooth muscle motility.

Transcriptional negative regulation of the proteolytic system of Lactobacillus helveticus CM4 in response to amino acids seems to be very important for the control of antihypertensive peptide production; however, it remains poorly understood. A 26-kDa protein with N-terminal cystathionine ß-synthase domains (CBS domain protein), which seems to be involved in the regulatory system, was purified by using a DNA-sepharose bound 300-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the upstream regions of the six proteolytic genes that are down-regulated by amino acids. The CBS domain protein bound to a DNA fragment corresponding to the region upstream of the pepV gene in response to branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). The expression of the pepV gene in Escherichia coli grown in BCAA-enriched medium was repressed when the CBS domain protein was co-expressed. These results reveal that the CBS domain protein acts as a novel type of BCAA-responsive transcriptional regulator (BCARR) in L. helveticus. From comparative analysis of the promoter regions of the six proteolysis genes, a palindromic AT-rich motif, 5'-AAAAANNCTWTTATT-3', was predicted as the consensus DNA motif for the BCARR protein binding. Footprint analysis using the pepV promotor region and gel shift analyses with the corresponding short DNA fragments strongly suggested that the BCARR protein binds adjacent to the pepV promoter region and affects the transcription level of the pepV gene in the presence of BCAAs. Homology search analysis of the C-terminal region of the BCARR protein suggested the existence of a unique ßaßßaß fold structure that has been reported in a variety of ACT (aspartate kinase-chorismate mutase-tyrA) domain proteins for sensing amino acids. These results also suggest that the sensing of BCAAs by the ACT domain might promote the binding of the BCARR to DNA sequences upstream of proteolysis genes, which affects the gene expression of the proteolytic system in L. helveticus.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a colorless gas characterized by its pungent odor of rotten eggs has been reported to elicit relaxation effects on basal and pre-contracted non-ocular smooth muscles of several mammalian species. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological actions of a H2S donor, GYY4137 on isolated bovine posterior ciliary artery after contraction with the adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine. Furthermore, we studied the underlying mechanism of inhibitory action of GYY4137 on the posterior ciliary arteries. Isolated bovine posterior ciliary arteries were mounted in oxygenated organ baths and changes in isometric tension were measured with a Grass FT03 transducer connected to a recorder using a Grass Polyview Software. The relaxant actions of GYY4137 on phenylephrine pre-contracted arteries were observed in the absence and presence of an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, flurbiprofen. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of GYY4137 were studied in the absence or presence of inhibitors/activators of biosynthetic enzymes for H2S and nitric oxide production, as well as specific ion channel blockers. In the concentration range, 100 nM to 100 µM, GYY4137 elicited a concentration-dependant relaxation of phenylephrine-induced tone in isolated posterior ciliary arteries, with IC50 value of 13.4 ± 1.9 µM (n = 6). The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen, significantly (p &lt; 0.01) enhanced the relaxation induced by GYY4137 yielding IC50 value of 0.13 ± 0.08 µM (n = 6). Both the inhibitors of cystathionine ß-synthase (aminooxyacetic acid, AOAA, 30 µM) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (propargylglycine, PAG, 1 mM) caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve to GYY4137. Furthermore, the KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide (100 µM) significantly (p &lt; 0.01) attenuated the relaxant action induced by GYY4137 on bovine ciliary artery. Conversely, the activator of cystathionine ß-synthase, SAM (100 µM) and an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, L-NAME (100 µM) had no significant effect on relaxations induced by GYY4137. We conclude that the inhibitory action of GYY4137 on isolated bovine ciliary artery is dependent upon the endogenous production of both prostanoids and H2S. Furthermore, the observed vascular smooth muscle relaxation induced by GYY4137 is mediated, at least in part, by KATP channels.

BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for arterial and venous thromboses in adults. Homocysteine is increased in cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, a treatable amino acid metabolic disorder that may be missed on newborn screening placing children at risk of thrombosis and strokes.PATIENT: We present a 3-year-old girl with normal newborn screening for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency who developed a symptomatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Subsequent testing revealed marked hyperhomocystinemia and genetic testing confirmed cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.CONCLUSIONS: Current newborn screening is limited in its ability to detect cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and although postanalytical interpretation may provide increased sensitivity, a normal newborn screening result should not replace the importance of physician surveillance.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the level in plasma hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the expression of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) (two key synthetases for endogenous H2S generation in the kidney) in obstructed kidney tissue among rats with tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), and to explore the role of H2S in TIF.METHODS: Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham-operated, model, low-dose NaHS and high-dose NaHS groups (n=24 each). TIF was induced by UUO in the model, low-dose NaHS and high-dose NaHS groups. The low-dose and high-dose NaHS groups were intraperitoneally injected with NaHS (1.4 and 7.0 µmol/kg respectively) twice daily immediately after operation, and the sham-operated and model groups were intraperitoneally injected with an identical volume of normal saline. In each group, 8 rats were randomly selected and sacrificed at 7, 14 or 21 days after operation. Plasma H2S concentration was measured by deproteinization. The obstructed kidney tissue was subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson staining, and the renal tubulointerstitial injury was evaluated under a microscope. mRNA and protein expression of CBS and CSE in the obstructed kidney tissue was measured by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively.RESULTS: The degree of UUO-induced renal tubulointerstitial injury was negatively correlated with plasma H2S concentration in (r=-0.891, P&lt;0.01). With H2S supplementation, renal tubulointerstitial injury was reduced (P&lt;0.01), the expression of mRNA and protein of CBS and CSE in the kidney tissue and plasma H2S level were upregulated (P&lt;0.01), and the degree of TIF was reduced (P&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences in plasma H2S level and mRNA and protein expression of CBS and CSE between the low-dose and high-dose NaHS groups (P&gt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: H2S is involved in the development of UUO-induced TIF, and the CBS/H2S and CSE/H2S systems play key roles in this process. H2S supplementation can delay the progression of TIF.

The immunolocation of cystationine ß-synthase in the motor, sensitive, and autonomic nuclei of the cerebral pons was studied on the material from 8 healthy men aged 18-44 years dead from traumas not involving the CNS. The motor nuclei contained numerous large intensely stained cells, while the sensitive and autonomic nuclei contained many small neurons with low levels of cystationine ß-synthase marker. However, cells with intense reaction were found among small neurons. They were located mainly at the nuclear periphery, between the nuclei or between the nuclei and conduction tracts. The content of immunopositive neurons in the studied nuclei varied from 2 to 14%. The level of these cells in motor nuclei was 3-4-fold higher than in sensitive and autonomic nuclei.

Epigenetic mechanisms underlying nutrition (nutrition epigenetics) are important in understanding human health. Nutritional supplements, for example folic acid, a cofactor in one-carbon metabolism, regulate epigenetic alterations and may play an important role in the maintenance of neuronal integrity. Folic acid also ameliorates hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a consequence of elevated levels of homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia induces oxidative stress that may epigenetically mediate cerebrovascular remodeling and leads to neurodegeneration; however, the mechanisms behind such alterations remain unclear. Therefore, the present study was designed to observe the protective effects of folic acid against hyperhomocysteinemia-induced epigenetic and molecular alterations leading to neurotoxic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we employed 8-weeks-old male wild-type (WT) cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout methionine-fed (CBS+/-<U+2009>+<U+2009>Met), WT, and CBS+/-<U+2009>+<U+2009>Met mice supplemented with folic acid (FA) [WT<U+2009>+<U+2009>FA and CBS+/-<U+2009>+<U+2009>Met<U+2009>+<U+2009>FA, respectively, 0.0057-µg g-1 day-1 dose in drinking water/4 weeks]. Hyperhomocysteinemia in CBS+/-<U+2009>+<U+2009>Met mouse brain was accompanied by a decrease in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and an increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase expression, symptoms of oxidative stress, upregulation of DNA methyltransferases, rise in matrix metalloproteinases, a drop in the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, decreased expression of tight junction proteins, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, neurodegeneration, and synaptotoxicity. Supplementation of folic acid to CBS+/-<U+2009>+<U+2009>Met mouse brain led to a decrease in the homocysteine level and rescued pathogenic and epigenetic alterations, showing its protective efficacy against homocysteine-induced neurotoxicity.

AIM: We hypothesized that hydrogen sulphide (H2 S), acting specifically in the anteroventral preoptic region (AVPO - an important integrating site of thermal and cardiorespiratory responses to hypoxia in which H2 S synthesis has been shown to be increased under hypoxic conditions), modulates the hypoxic ventilatory response.METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we measured pulmonary ventilation (V<U+02D9>E) and deep body temperature of rats before and after intracerebroventricular (icv) or intra-AVPO microinjection of aminooxyacetate (AOA; CBS inhibitor) or Na2 S (H2 S donor) followed by 60 min of hypoxia exposure (7% O2 ). Furthermore, we assessed the AVPO levels of H2 S of rats exposed to hypoxia. Control rats were kept under normoxia.RESULTS: Microinjection of vehicle, AOA or Na2 S did not change V<U+02D9>E under normoxic conditions. Hypoxia caused an increase in ventilation, which was potentiated by microinjection of AOA because of a further augmented tidal volume. Conversely, treatment with Na2 S significantly attenuated this response. The in vivo H2 S data indicated that during hypoxia the lower the deep body temperature the smaller the degree of hyperventilation. Under hypoxia, H2 S production was found to be increased in the AVPO, indicating that its production is responsive to hypoxia. The CBS inhibitor attenuated the hypoxia-induced increase in the H2 S synthesis, suggesting an endogenous synthesis of the gas.CONCLUSION: These data provide solid evidence that AVPO H2 S production is stimulated by hypoxia, and this gaseous messenger exerts an inhibitory modulation of the hypoxic ventilatory response. It is probable that the H2 S modulation of hypoxia-induced hyperventilation is at least in part in proportion to metabolism.

Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) catalyze homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism via the trans-sulfuration pathway. They are also responsible for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production via desulfuration reactions. The liver contributes significantly to the regulation of Hcy and H2S homeostasis, which might participate in many physiological and pathological processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) on hepatic CBS and CSE expression and its impact on Hcy and H2S metabolism. Mice (C57BL/6) fed a HFD (60% kcal fat) for 5 weeks developed fatty liver. The mRNA and protein levels of CBS and CSE in the liver were significantly elevated in mice fed a HFD. Subsequently the metabolism of Hcy by CBS and CSE was increased in the liver, and its level decreased in the circulation. Increased CBS and CSE expression also caused a significant elevation in H2S production in the liver. The level of lipid peroxides was elevated, indicating oxidative stress, while the level of total glutathione remained unchanged in the liver of HFD-fed mice. Upregulation of the trans-sulfuration pathway might play an adaptive role against oxidative stress by maintaining total glutathione levels in the liver. 



#### Endogenous hydrogen sulfide in perivascular adipose tissue: role in the regulation of vascular tone in physiology and pathology.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and is enzymatically metabolized in mitochondria by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR). Recent studies have indicated that H2S is synthesized by CSE in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), and is responsible for the anticontractile effect of PVAT on adjacent vessels. The lipophilic statin atorvastatin increases PVAT-derived H2S by suppressing its mitochondrial oxidation; the effect that results from statin-induced depletion of ubiquinone. Experimental obesity induced by a highly palatable diet has a time-dependent effect on H2S in PVAT. Adipose tissue hypoxia suppresses H2S oxidation and increases its level in short-term obesity not associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, in long-term obesity, insulin resistance and (or) hyperinsulinemia result in the down-regulation of CSE and H2S deficiency, which is corrected by treatment with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist administered for 2 weeks increases H2S by impairing mitochondria biogenesis. This indicates that the rate of mitochondrial H2S oxidation plays an important role in the regulation of H2S level in PVAT. Up-regulation of H2S signaling in short-term obesity and (or) by elevated endocannabinoids may be a compensatory mechanism that maintains vascular tone, despite endothelial dysfunction.

O-Acetylserine(thiol)lyases (OAS-TLs) play a pivotal role in a sulfur assimilation pathway incorporating sulfide into amino acids in microorganisms and plants, however, these enzymes have not been found in the animal kingdom. Interestingly, the genome of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans contains three expressed genes predicted to encode OAS-TL orthologs (cysl-1-cysl-3), and a related pseudogene (cysl-4); these genes play different roles in resistance to hypoxia, hydrogen sulfide and cyanide. To get an insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms we purified the three recombinant worm OAS-TL proteins, and we determined their enzymatic activities, substrate binding affinities, quaternary structures and the conformations of their active site shapes. We show that the nematode OAS-TL orthologs can bind O-acetylserine and catalyze the canonical reaction although this ligand may more likely serve as a competitive inhibitor to natural substrates instead of being a substrate for sulfur assimilation. In addition, we propose that S-sulfocysteine may be a novel endogenous substrate for these proteins. However, we observed that the three OAS-TL proteins are conformationally different and exhibit distinct substrate specificity. Based on the available evidences we propose the following model: CYSL-1 interacts with EGL-9 and activates HIF-1 that upregulates expression of genes detoxifying sulfide and cyanide, the CYSL-2 acts as a cyanoalanine synthase in the cyanide detoxification pathway and simultaneously produces hydrogen sulfide, while the role of CYSL-3 remains unclear although it exhibits sulfhydrylase activity in vitro. All these data indicate that C. elegans OAS-TL paralogs have distinct cellular functions and may play different roles in maintaining hydrogen sulfide homeostasis.

Intramembrane metalloproteases are nearly ubiquitous in living organisms and they function in diverse processes ranging from cholesterol homeostasis and the unfolded protein response in humans to sporulation, stress responses, and virulence of bacteria. Understanding how these enzymes function in membranes is a challenge of fundamental interest with potential applications if modulators can be devised. Progress is described toward a mechanistic understanding, based primarily on molecular genetic and biochemical studies of human S2P and bacterial SpoIVFB and RseP, and on the structure of the membrane domain of an archaeal enzyme. Conserved features of the enzymes appear to include transmembrane helices and loops around the active site zinc ion, which may be near the membrane surface. Extramembrane domains such as PDZ (PSD-95, DLG, ZO-1) or CBS (cystathionine-ß-synthase) domains govern substrate access to the active site, but several different mechanisms of access and cleavage site selection can be envisioned, which might differ depending on the substrate and the enzyme. More work is needed to distinguish between these mechanisms, both for enzymes that have been relatively well-studied, and for enzymes lacking PDZ and CBS domains, which have not been studied. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Intramembrane Proteases.

BACKGROUND: Ganoderma lucidum has been purported as a potent remedy in the treatment and prevention of several ailments, including hypertension. This study aimed to explore the anti-ACE potential of protein fractions from the mycelia of G. lucidum.METHODS: Ganoderma lucidum mycelia were cultivated by submerged fermentation in a liquid medium containing brown sugar and spent brewer's yeast. Intracellular proteins were fractionated from mycelia crude water extract by ammonium sulphate precipitation, and their angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity was evaluated. The potential anti-ACE protein fractions were further separated by RP-HPLC and characterised using proteomics platforms.RESULTS: Preliminary result demonstrated that the mycelia crude water extract inhibited ACE at IC50 value of 1.134 ± 0.036 mg/mL. Following protein fractionation and HPLC purification, the presence of highly potential anti-ACE proteins with the IC50 values less than 200 µg/mL was detected. Characterisation of these proteins demonstrated the presence of four different antihypertensive-related proteins involved in the regulation of blood pressure through different mechanisms.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the mycelia of G. lucidum has high potential in lowering blood pressure level due to the presence of several antihypertensive-related proteins such as cystathionine beta synthase-like protein, DEAD/DEAH box helicase-like protein, paxillin-like protein, and alpha/beta hydrolase-like protein.

Folate being an important vitamin of B Complex group in our diet plays an important role not only in the synthesis of DNA but also in the maintenance of methylation reactions in the cells. Folate metabolism is influenced by several processes especially its dietary intake and the polymorphisms of the associated genes involved. Aberrant folate metabolism, therefore, affects both methylation as well as the DNA synthesis processes, both of which have been implicated in the development of various diseases. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the processes involved in folate metabolism and consequences of deviant folate metabolism, particular emphasis is given to the polymorphic genes which have been implicated in the development of various diseases in humans, like vascular diseases, Down's syndrome, neural tube defects, psychiatric disorders and cancers.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality. Many studies have assessed the association between maternal gene polymorphisms involved in folate metabolism and the risk of having a DS offspring, but data are conflicting. Our study aimed to arrive at a more accurate estimation. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis of 26, 17, 9, 15, 9 and 6 case-control studies on the relationship between maternal methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C, methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G, methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G, reduced folate carrier 1 A80G and cystathionine ß-synthase 844ins68 polymorphisms and the risk of having a DS offspring. The allele contrast and model-free approach were used. Results showed marginal significant associations for MTHFR C677T, overall [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28 (1.22, 1.46) and generalised odds ratio (ORG) = 1.35 (1.16, 1.57)] and in Caucasian [OR = 1.15 (1.03, 1.29) and ORG = 1.20 (1.04, 1.38)], Asian [OR = 1.68 (1.08, 2.63) and ORG = 1.74 (1.08, 2.80)] and Brazilian [OR = 1.22 (1.04, 1.43) and ORG = 1.28 (1.06, 1.55)] populations; for MTRR A66G, overall [OR = 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) and ORG = 1.31 (1.06, 1.62)]; and for RFC1 A80G, overall [OR = 1.16 (1.02, 1.31) and ORG = 1.18 (1.01, 1.37)]. MTHFR A1298C, MTR 12756G and CBS 844ins68 polymorphisms produced non-significant results. Since potential confounders could not be ruled out completely in this meta-analysis, further studies are needed to confirm these results.

Decrease in endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was reported to participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study is aimed at exploring the relationship between the abnormalities in H2S metabolism, hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and the activation of intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Cultured renal mesangial cells (MCs) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were used for the studies. The expressions of angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) type I receptor (AT1), transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1) and collagen IV were measured by real time PCR and Western blot. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by fluorescent probe assays. Cell proliferation was analyzed by 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay. Ang II concentration was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. AGT, ACE and AT1 receptor mRNA levels and Ang II concentration were increased in high glucose (HG) -treated MCs, the cell proliferation rate and the production of TGF-ß1 and of collagen IV productions were also increased. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylenechloride iodonium (DPI) was able to reverse the HG-induced RAS activation and the changes in cell proliferation and collagen synthesis. Supplementation of H2S attenuated HG-induced elevations in ROS and RAS activation. Blockade on H2S biosynthesis from cystathione-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) by DL-propargylglycine (PPG) resulted in effects similar to that of HG treatment. In STZ-induced diabetic rats, the changes in RAS were also reversed by H2S supplementation without affecting blood glucose concentration. These data suggested that the decrease in H2S under hyperglycemic condition leads to an imbalance between oxidative and reductive species. The increased oxidative species results in intrarenal RAS activation, which, in turn, contributes to the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a pivotal guardian of whole-body energy metabolism, has become an attractive therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome. Previously, using a homogeneous scintillation proximity assay, we identified the small-molecule AMPK activator C24 from an optimization based on the original allosteric activator PT1. In this paper, the AMPK activation mechanism of C24 and its potential beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism on db/db mice were investigated. C24 allosterically stimulated inactive AMPK a subunit truncations and activated AMPK heterotrimers by antagonizing autoinhibition. In primary hepatocytes, C24 increased the phosphorylation of AMPK downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase dose-dependently without changing intracellular AMP/ATP ratio, indicating its allosteric activation in cells. Through activating AMPK, C24 decreased glucose output by down-regulating mRNA levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in primary hepatocytes. C24 also decreased the triglyceride and cholesterol contents in HepG2 cells. Due to its improved bioavailability, chronic oral treatment with multiple doses of C24 significantly reduced blood glucose and lipid levels in plasma, and improved the glucose tolerance of diabetic db/db mice. The hepatic transcriptional levels of PEPCK and G6Pase were reduced. These results demonstrate that this orally effective activator of AMPK represents a novel approach to the treatment of metabolic syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between methylation of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) promoter and clinicopathological features in colorectal cancer.METHODS: Bisulfate sequencing PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the methylation of CpG island in CBS promoter of 95 sporadic colorectal cancers. Software SPSS PASW Statistics was used to analyze the data of the hypermethylation levels in the malignant tissues and the correlation with pathological parameters and clinical outcome.RESULTS: Methylation levels in tumor tissue of patients [(64.9 ± 14.3)%]with colorectal cancer were significantly higher than that in normal tissues[(27.5 ± 13.1)%, P &lt; 0.001]. The CBS mRNA levels in the hypomethylation group (7.22 ± 1.91) were significantly higher than that in the hypermethylation group (2.78 ± 1.12, P &lt; 0.01). Univariate analysis showed that age, pT stage, pN stage, liver metastases, pTNM stage, and CBS hypermethylation level significantly correlated with the survival and recurrence rates of colorectal cancer patients (All P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that CBS hypermethylation level and liver metastasis were independent factors significantly correlated with the recurrence rate and overall survival of the patients (All P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that methylation of CpG island in CBS promoter is correlated with the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer and plays a role in its tumorigenesis. It might serve as a useful marker for early diagnosis, targeted therapy and prediction of prognosis in colorectal cancer.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) controls the flux of sulfur from methionine to cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, taurine, and H2S. CBS condenses serine and homocysteine to cystathionine with the help of three cofactors, heme, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, and S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Inherited deficiency of CBS activity causes homocystinuria, the most frequent disorder of sulfur metabolism. We present the structure of the human enzyme, discuss the unique arrangement of the CBS domains in the C-terminal region, and propose how they interact with the catalytic core of the complementary subunit to regulate access to the catalytic site. This arrangement clearly contrasts with other proteins containing the CBS domain including the recent Drosophila melanogaster CBS structure. The absence of large conformational changes and the crystal structure of the partially activated pathogenic D444N mutant suggest that the rotation of CBS motifs and relaxation of loops delineating the entrance to the catalytic site represent the most likely molecular mechanism of CBS activation by S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Moreover, our data suggest how tetramers, the native quaternary structure of the mammalian CBS enzymes, are formed. Because of its central role in transsulfuration, redox status, and H2S biogenesis, CBS represents a very attractive therapeutic target. The availability of the structure will help us understand the pathogenicity of the numerous missense mutations causing inherited homocystinuria and will allow the rational design of compounds modulating CBS activity.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a well-known toxic gas that has the smell of rotten eggs. This pungent gas was considered as a physiological mediator, after the identification of endogenous sulfides in the mammalian brain. H2S is produced from L-cysteine by enzymes such as cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). We recently identified a fourth pathway, where H2S is produced from D-cysteine by the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) along with 3MST. We demonstrated that H2S is a neuromodulator that facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) by enhancing the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. It also induces Ca(2+) influx in the astrocytes by activating the transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) channels. In addition to being a signaling molecule, it also functions as a neuroprotective agent by enhancing the production of glutathione, a major intracellular antioxidant that scavenges the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria. H2S regulates the activity of the enzymes by incorporating the bound sulfane sulfur to cysteine residues. This modification is known as sulfhydration or sulfuration. The neuroprotective ubiquitin E3 ligase, parkin, enhances its neuroprotective activity by this modification. This review is focused on the functional role of H2S as a signaling molecule and as a cytoprotectant in the nervous system. In addition, this review shows the recent findings that indicate that the H2S-derived polysulfides found in the brain activate TRPA1 channels more potently than parental H2S.

Homocysteine is metabolized to methionine by the action of 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Alternatively, by the transulfuration pathway, homocysteine is transformed to hydrogen sulphide (H2S), through multiple steps involving cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. Here we have evaluated the involvement of H2S in the thrombotic events associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. To this purpose we have used platelets harvested from healthy volunteers or patients newly diagnosed with hyperhomocysteinemia with a C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene (MTHFR++). NaHS (0.1-100 µM) or l-cysteine (0.1-100 µM) significantly increased platelet aggregation harvested from healthy volunteers induced by thrombin receptor activator peptide-6 amide (2 µM) in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase was significantly potentiated in platelets harvested from MTHFR++ carriers, and it was reversed by the inhibition of either cystathionine ß-synthase or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. Similarly, in MTHFR++ carriers, the content of H2S was significantly higher in either platelets or plasma compared with healthy volunteers. Interestingly, thromboxane A2 production was markedly increased in response to both NaHS or l-cysteine in platelets of healthy volunteers. The inhibition of phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase, or blockade of the thromboxane receptor markedly reduced the effects of H2S. Finally, phosphorylated-phospholipase A2 expression was significantly higher in MTHFR++ carriers compared with healthy volunteers. In conclusion, the H2S pathway is involved in the prothrombotic events occurring in hyperhomocysteinemic patients.

Previous studies suggested that the hepatoprotective activity of betaine is associated with its effects on sulfur amino acid metabolism. We examined the mechanism by which betaine prevents the progression of alcoholic liver injury and its therapeutic potential. Rats received a liquid ethanol diet for 6 wk. Ethanol consumption elevated serum triglyceride and TNFa levels, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and lipid accumulation in liver. The oxyradical scavenging capacity of liver was reduced, and expression of CD14, TNFa, COX-2, and iNOS mRNAs was induced markedly. These ethanol-induced changes were all inhibited effectively by betaine supplementation. Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, cysteine, and glutathione levels, reduced in the ethanol-fed rats, were increased by betaine supplementation. Methionine adenosyltransferase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase were induced, but cysteine dioxygenase was down-regulated, which appeared to account for the increment in cysteine availability for glutathione synthesis in the rats supplemented with betaine. Betaine supplementation for the final 2 wk of ethanol intake resulted in a similar degree of hepatoprotection, revealing its potential therapeutic value in alcoholic liver. It is concluded that the protective effects of betaine against alcoholic liver injury may be attributed to the fortification of antioxidant defense via improvement of impaired sulfur amino acid metabolism.

Persistent hypermethioninemia due to mutations in the MAT1A gene is often found during newborn screening (NBS) for homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, however, outcomes and optimal management for these patients are not well established. We carried out a multicenter study of MAT I/III-deficient patients detected by NBS in four of the Spanish regional NBS programs. Data evaluated during NBS and follow-up for 18 patients included methionine and total homocysteine levels, clinical presentation parameters, genotypes, and development quotients. The birth prevalence was 1:1:22,874. At detection 16 of the 18 patients exhibited elevations of plasma methionine above 60 µmol/L (mean 99.9 ± 38 µmol/L) and the mean value in confirmation tests was 301 µmol/L (91-899) µmol/L. All patients were asymptomatic. In four patients with more markedly elevated plasma methionines (&gt;450 µmol/L) total homocysteine values were slightly elevated (about 20 µmol/L). The average follow-up period was 3 years 7 months (range: 2-123 months). Most patients (83%) were heterozygous for the autosomal dominant Arg264His mutation and, with one exception, presented relatively low circulating methionine concentrations (&lt;400 µM). Additional mutations identified in patients with mean confirmatory plasma methionines above 400 µM were Arg199Cys, Leu355Arg, and a novel mutation, Thr288Ala. During continued follow-up, the patients have been asymptomatic, and, to date, no therapeutic interventions have been utilized. Therefore, the currently available evidence shows that hypermethioninemia due to heterozygous MAT1A mutations such as Arg264His is a mild condition for which no treatment is necessary.

Until recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) was exclusively viewed a toxic gas and an environmental hazard, with its toxicity primarily attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial Complex IV, resulting in a shutdown of mitochondrial electron transport and cellular ATP generation. Work over the last decade established multiple biological regulatory roles of H2 S, as an endogenous gaseous transmitter. H2 S is produced by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). In striking contrast to its inhibitory effect on Complex IV, recent studies showed that at lower concentrations, H2 S serves as a stimulator of electron transport in mammalian cells, by acting as a mitochondrial electron donor. Endogenous H2 S, produced by mitochondrially localized 3-MST, supports basal, physiological cellular bioenergetic functions; the activity of this metabolic support declines with physiological aging. In specialized conditions (calcium overload in vascular smooth muscle, colon cancer cells), CSE and CBS can also associate with the mitochondria; H2 S produced by these enzymes, serves as an endogenous stimulator of cellular bioenergetics. The current article overviews the biochemical mechanisms underlying the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of H2 S on mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics and discusses the implication of these processes for normal cellular physiology. The relevance of H2 S biology is also discussed in the context of colonic epithelial cell physiology: colonocytes are exposed to high levels of sulfide produced by enteric bacteria, and serve as a metabolic barrier to limit their entry into the mammalian host, while, at the same time, utilizing it as a metabolic 'fuel'.

Emerging work demonstrates the dual regulation of mitochondrial function by hydrogen sulfide (H2 S), including, at lower concentrations, a stimulatory effect as an electron donor, and, at higher concentrations, an inhibitory effect on cytochrome C oxidase. In the current article, we overview the pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of these processes. During cellular hypoxia/acidosis, the inhibitory effect of H2 S on complex IV is enhanced, which may shift the balance of H2 S from protective to deleterious. Several pathophysiological conditions are associated with an overproduction of H2 S (e.g. sepsis), while in other disease states H2 S levels and H2 S bioavailability are reduced and its therapeutic replacement is warranted (e.g. diabetic vascular complications). Moreover, recent studies demonstrate that colorectal cancer cells up-regulate the H2 S-producing enzyme cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), and utilize its product, H2 S, as a metabolic fuel and tumour-cell survival factor; pharmacological CBS inhibition or genetic CBS silencing suppresses cancer cell bioenergetics and suppresses cell proliferation and cell chemotaxis. In the last chapter of the current article, we overview the field of H2 S-induced therapeutic 'suspended animation', a concept in which a temporary pharmacological reduction in cell metabolism is achieved, producing a decreased oxygen demand for the experimental therapy of critical illness and/or organ transplantation.



#### Common gating of both CLC transporter subunits underlies voltage-dependent activation of the 2Cl-/1H+ exchanger ClC-7/Ostm1.

CLC anion transporters form dimers that function either as Cl(-) channels or as electrogenic Cl(-)/H(+) exchangers. CLC channels display two different types of &quot;gates,&quot; &quot;protopore&quot; gates that open and close the two pores of a CLC dimer independently of each other and common gates that act on both pores simultaneously. ClC-7/Ostm1 is a lysosomal 2Cl(-)/1H(+) exchanger that is slowly activated by depolarization. This gating process is drastically accelerated by many CLCN7 mutations underlying human osteopetrosis. Making use of some of these mutants, we now investigate whether slow voltage activation of plasma membrane-targeted ClC-7/Ostm1 involves protopore or common gates. Voltage activation of wild-type ClC-7 subunits was accelerated by co-expressing an excess of ClC-7 subunits carrying an accelerating mutation together with a point mutation rendering these subunits transport-deficient. Conversely, voltage activation of a fast ClC-7 mutant could be slowed by co-expressing an excess of a transport-deficient mutant. These effects did not depend on whether the accelerating mutation localized to the transmembrane part or to cytoplasmic cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) domains of ClC-7. Combining accelerating mutations in the same subunit did not speed up gating further. No currents were observed when ClC-7 was truncated after the last intramembrane helix. Currents and slow gating were restored when the C terminus was co-expressed by itself or fused to the C terminus of the ß-subunit Ostm1. We conclude that common gating underlies the slow voltage activation of ClC-7. It depends on the CBS domain-containing C terminus that does not require covalent binding to the membrane domain of ClC-7.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine to generate cystathionine. Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder commonly caused by a deficiency of CBS activity. Here, we characterized a novel CBS mutation (c.260C&gt;A (p.T87N)) and a previously reported variant (c.700G&gt;A (p.D234N)) found in Venezuelan homocystinuric patients, one nonresponsive and one responsive to vitamin B6. Both mutant proteins were expressed in vitro in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, finding lower soluble expression in HEK-293 cells (19% T87N and 23% D234N) compared to wild-type CBS. Residual activities obtained for the mutant proteins were 3.5% T87N and 43% D234N. Gel exclusion chromatography demonstrated a tendency of the T87N mutant to aggregate while the distribution of the D234N mutant was similar to wild-type enzyme. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, an unexpected difference in intracellular localization was observed between the wild-type and mutant proteins. While the T87N mutant exhibited a punctate appearance, the wild-type protein was homogeneously distributed inside the cell. Interestingly, the D234N protein showed both distributions. This study demonstrates that the pathogenic CBS mutations generate unstable proteins that are unable (T87N) or partially unable (D234N) to assemble into a functional enzyme, implying that these mutations might be responsible for the homocystinuria phenotype.

A reduced response of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to its allosteric activator S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) has been reported to be a cause of CBS dysfunction in homocystinuria patients. In this work we performed a retrospective analysis of fibroblast data from 62 homocystinuria patients and found that 13 of them presented a disturbed SAM activation. Their genotypic background was identified and the corresponding CBS mutant proteins were produced in E. coli. Nine distinct mutations were detected in 22 independent alleles: the novel mutations p.K269del, p.P427L, p.S500L and p.L540Q; and the previously described mutations p.P49L, p.C165Rfs*2, p.I278T, p.R336H and p.D444N. Expression levels and residual enzyme activities, determined in the soluble fraction of E. coli lysates, strongly correlated with the localization of the affected amino acid residue. C-terminal mutations lead to activities in the range of the wild-type CBS and to oligomeric forms migrating faster than tetramers, suggesting an abnormal conformation that might be responsible for the lack of SAM activation. Mutations in the catalytic core were associated with low protein expression levels, decreased enzyme activities and a higher content of high molecular mass forms. Furthermore, the absence of SAM activation found in the patients' fibroblasts was confirmed for all but one of the characterized recombinant proteins (p.P49L). Our study experimentally supports a deficient regulation of CBS by SAM as a frequently found mechanism in CBS deficiency, which should be considered not only as a valuable diagnostic tool but also as a potential target for the development of new therapeutic approaches in classical homocystinuria.

BACKGROUND: There is not much information on established standard therapy for patients with severe methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) I/III deficiency.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a boy with MAT I/III deficiency, in whom plasma methionine and total homocysteine, and urinary homocystine were elevated. Molecular genetic studies showed him to have novel compound heterozygous mutations of the MAT1A gene: c.191T&gt;A (p.M64K) and c.589delC (p.P197LfsX26). A low methionine milk diet was started at 31 days of age, and during continuing dietary methionine restriction plasma methionine levels have been maintained at less than 750 µmol/L. He is now 5 years old, and has had entirely normal physical growth and psychomotor development.CONCLUSIONS: Although some severely MAT I/III deficient patients have developed neurologic abnormalities, we report here the case of a boy who has remained neurologically and otherwise normal for 5 years during methionine restriction, suggesting that perhaps such management, started in early infancy, may help prevent neurological complications.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), cystathione-ß-synthase (CBS) and methionine synthase (MTR) genes interact with each other and the environment. These interactions could influence homocysteine (Hcy) and diseases contingent thereon. We determined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes, their relationships and interactions with total Hcy concentrations within black South Africans to address the increased prevalence of diseases associated with Hcy. The MTHFR 677 TT and MTR 2756 AA genotypes were associated with higher Hcy concentrations (16.6 and 10.1 µmol/L; p&lt;0.05) compared to subjects harboring the MTHFR 677 CT/CC and the MTR 2756 AG genotypes (10.5, 9.7 and 9.5 µmol/L, respectively). The investigated CBS genotypes did not influence Hcy. We demonstrated interactions between the area of residence and the CBS T833C/844ins68 genotypes (p=0.005) so that when harboring the wildtype allele, rural subjects had significantly higher Hcy than their urban counterparts, but when hosting the variant allele the environment made no difference to Hcy. Between the CBS T833C/844ins68 or G9276A and MTHFR C677T genotypes, there were two-way interactions (p=0.003 and=0.004, respectively), with regard to Hcy. Subjects harboring the MTHFR 677 TT genotype in combination with the CBS 833 TT/homozygous 844 non-insert or the MTHFR 677 TT genotype in combination with the CBS 9276 GA/GG displayed higher Hcy concentrations. Therefore, some of the investigated genotypes affected Hcy; residential area changed the way in which the CBS T833C/844ins68 SNPs influenced Hcy concentrations highlighting the importance of environmental factors; and gene-gene interactions allude to epistatic effects.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and it contributes to maintenance of mucosal integrity, resolution of inflammation, and repair of damaged tissue. H2S synthesis is elevated in inflamed and damaged colonic tissue, but the enzymatic sources of that synthesis are not completely understood. In the present study, the contributions of three enzymatic pathways to colonic H2S synthesis were determined, with tissues taken from healthy rats and rats with colitis. The ability of the colonic tissue to inactivate H2S was also determined. Colonic tissue from rats with hapten-induced colitis produced significantly more H2S than tissue from healthy controls. The largest source of the H2S synthesis was the pathway involving cysteine amino transferase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (an a-ketoglutarate-dependent pathway). Elevated H2S synthesis occurred specifically at sites of mucosal ulceration, and was not related to the extent of granulocyte infiltration into the tissue. Inactivation of H2S by colonic tissue occurred rapidly, and was significantly reduced at sites of mucosal ulceration. This correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of sulfide quinone reductase in these regions. Together, the increased production and decreased inactivation of H2S at sites of mucosal ulceration would result in higher H2S levels at these sites, which promotes of resolution of inflammation and repair of damaged tissue.

Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) also known as Nagana is a devastating disease among domestic animals in large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa causing loses in milk and meat production as well as traction power. However, there is currently no commercial vaccine against AAT. The parasites have also developed resistance to some of the drugs in use. Moreover, the use of affordable computer-aided wet bench methods in the search for vaccine and/or new drug targets against this disease have not yet been fully explored in developing countries. This study, therefore, explored the use of PCR to screen a freshly prepared bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. b. brucei) expression library for coding sequences followed by bioinformatics analyses specifying the functions and importance of these proteins to parasite survival. Eleven protein coding sequences were identified from twenty nine purified clones. The putative retro transposon hot spot protein 4 (RHSP 4) was the only protein with a fully annotated DNA sequence. All the others were hypothetical or had partial or unqualified annotations. RHSP 4 and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component, alpha sub-unit (PDE1a) are involved in aerobic respiration whereas succinyl-Co A-3-ketoacid-coenzyme A transferase mitochondrial precursor (SKTMP) is predicted to be involved in ketone body catabolism. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase (aMT) have been predicted in cysteine biosynthesis and vesicular transport respectively. The functions of the hypothetical proteins encountered have neither been experimentally determined nor predicted. We hypothesize that both CBS and PDE1a are good drug targets. Overall, about 300 plates are required to PCR screen the entire Trypanosoma brucei genome in approximately eight months. This method is therefore, applicable and affordable in the search for new drug targets under conditions of limited resources among developing countries.

Any two individuals differ from each other by an average of 3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Some polymorphisms have a functional impact on cofactor-using enzymes and therefore represent points of possible therapeutic intervention through elevated-cofactor remediation. Because most known disease-causing mutations affect protein stability, we evaluated how the in vivo impact caused by single amino acid substitutions in a prototypical enzyme of this type compared with physical characteristics of the variant enzymes in vitro. We focused on cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) because of its clinical relevance in homocysteine metabolism and because some variants of the enzyme are clinically responsive to increased levels of its B6 cofactor. Single amino-acid substitutions throughout the CBS protein caused reduced function in vivo, and a subset of these altered sensitivity to limiting B6-cofactor. Some of these B6-sensitive substitutions also had altered sensitivity to limiting heme, another CBS cofactor. Limiting heme resulted in reduced incorporation of heme into these variants, and subsequently increased protease sensitivity of the enzyme in vitro. We hypothesize that these alleles caused a modest, yet significant, destabilization of the native state of the protein, and that the functional impact of the amino acid substitutions caused by these alleles can be influenced by cofactor(s) even when the affected amino acid is distant from the cofactor binding site.

OBJECTIVE: To study the expressions of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle of castrated rats and their roles in erectile dysfunction after castration.METHODS: We randomly assigned 40 eight-week-old male SD rats to groups A (2-week sham-operation), B (4-week sham-operation), C (2-week castration) and D (4-week castration). We determined the level of serum testosterone (T) and the expressions of CBS and CSE in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle of the rats after operation using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR.RESULTS: The T level was significantly decreased in groups C ([11.85 +/- 6.73] nmol/L) and D ([1.96 +/- 1.23] nmol/L) as compared with A ([89.65 +/- 17.13] nmol/L) and B ([106.75 +/- 19.68] nmol/L) (P &lt; 0.05). CBS and CSE were expressed in all groups of rats, but the relative expressions of CBS and CSE mRNA were significantly lower in groups C (0.93 +/- 0.14 and 0.87 +/- 0.20) and D (0.79 +/- 0.17 and 0.71 +/- 0.12) than in A (2.13 +/- 0.65 and 1.93 +/- 0.15) and B (2.07 +/- 0.53 and 1.89 +/- 0.45) (P &lt; 0. 05), so were the optical density values (IA) of the CBS and CSE proteins, 130.35 +/- 23.56 and 93.56 +/- 36.64 in group C and 80.29 +/- 29.65 and 58.56 +/- 19.95 in group D, as compared with 310.57 +/- 130.56 and 269.56 +/- 116.76 in group A and 349.68 +/-112.35 and 298.35 +/- 100.76 in group B (P &lt; 0.05). The androgen level was positively correlated with the expressions of CBS and CSE in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle of the rats.CONCLUSION: Androgen regulates erectile function via the expressions of CBS and CSE.

Recent expansion of our knowledge on epigenetic changes strongly suggests that not only nuclear DNA (nDNA), but also mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may be subjected to epigenetic modifications related to disease development, environmental exposure, drug treatment and aging. Thus, mtDNA methylation is attracting increasing attention as a potential biomarker for the detection and diagnosis of diseases and the understanding of cellular behavior in particular conditions. In this paper we review the current advances in mtDNA methylation studies with particular attention to the evidences of mtDNA methylation changes in diseases and physiological conditions so far investigated. Technological advances for the analysis of epigenetic variations are promising tools to provide insights into methylation of mtDNA with similar resolution levels as those reached for nDNA. However, many aspects related to mtDNA methylation are still unclear. More studies are needed to understand whether and how changes in mtDNA methylation patterns, global and gene specific, are associated to diseases or risk factors.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) known as a gasotransmitter is increasingly recognized for its anti-adhesive, anti-inflammatory and vasoactive properties. Due to these properties, we analysed anti-thrombotic effects of H2S and the participation of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In individual venules of the ear of hairless SKH1-hr mice, thrombus formation was induced using a phototoxic light/dye-injury model and intravital fluorescence microscopy. Animals were treated intravenously with the H2S donor Na2S or NaCl as control. In a second setting, the NOS inhibitor L-NAME was applied intraperitoneally as a bolus 12h prior to Na2S treatment and thrombus induction. Blood and ear tissue were sampled after microscopy for assessment of plasma concentrations of soluble (s)P-selectin, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 and expression of endothelial (e)NOS and inducible (i)NOS, respectively.RESULTS: When mice were treated with Na2S, venular thrombus formation was significantly delayed versus that in animals of the NaCl-treated control group. While plasma levels of pro-thrombotic adhesion molecules were not affected by Na2S, immunohistochemistry of the vessel walls showed a significant up-regulation of eNOS and iNOS expression within the Na2S-treated group. The delay of thrombus formation in the Na2S-group was partly but significantly reverted by application of L-NAME.CONCLUSIONS: The anti-thrombotic efficacy of H2S involves the NOS-pathway and may be of preventive and therapeutic value for clinical disorders with increased risk of thrombotic events.

BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria is a rare inherited disorder due to a deficiency in cystathionine beta synthase. Individuals with this condition appear normal at birth but develop serious complications in childhood. Diagnosis and treatment started sufficiently early in life can effectively prevent or reduce the severity of these complications.OBJECTIVES: To determine if newborn population screening for the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency leads to clinical benefit compared to later clinical diagnosis.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register.Date of the most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 15 May 2013.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials assessing the use of any neonatal screening test to diagnose infants with homocystinuria before the condition becomes clinically evident. Eligible studies compare a screened population versus a non-screened population.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.MAIN RESULTS: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify eligible studies for inclusion in this review and hence it is not possible to draw any conclusions based on controlled studies; however, we are aware of uncontrolled case-series which support the efficacy of newborn screening for homocystinuria and its early treatment. Any future randomised controlled trial would need to be both multicentre and long term in order to provide robust evidence for or against screening and to allow a cost effectiveness analysis to be undertaken.

CONTEXT: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) has been proved to be a neuromodulator and contributes to the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity in damage caused by anti-inflammatory nonsteroidal drugs. Previously, we demonstrated that H2S synthesis is essential to gastric protection against ethanol.OBJECTIVE: To better understanding the role of H2S and the detailed localization of its production in both normal and injured stomach due to ethanol injection, we studied the expression of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS) isoforms in gastric mucosa of mice treated with saline or 50% ethanol.METHODS: Mice were treated by gavage with saline or 50% ethanol (0.5 mL/25 g). After 1 hour, mice were sacrificed, and gastric tissue was evaluated by histological and immunohistochemical analysis specific for CSE and CBS.RESULTS: We have demonstrated a non-specific expression of CBS in the normal gastric mucosa and expression of CSE occurring mainly in the parietal cells of the animals treated with ethanol.CONCLUSION: Thus, we demonstrated that the expression of CBS appears to be constitutive and diffuse across the gastric epithelium, while the expression of CSE appears to be induced in parietal cells by damage agents such as ethanol.

Accumulating evidence shows that H2S has physiological functions in various tissues and organs. It includes regulation of neuronal activity, vascular tension, a release of insulin, and protection of the heart, kidney, and brain from ischemic insult. H2S is produced by enzymes from l-cysteine; cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase. We recently discovered an additional pathway for the production of H2S from d-cysteine. d-Amino acid oxidase provides 3-mercaptopyruvate for 3MST to produce H2S. d-Cysteine protects cerebellar neurons from oxidative stress and attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury caused in the kidney more effectively than l-cysteine. This review focuses on a novel pathway for the production of H2S and its therapeutic application especially to the renal diseases.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) identify susceptibility loci for complex traits, but do not identify particular genes of interest. Integration of functional and network information may help in overcoming this limitation and identifying new susceptibility loci. Using GWAS and comorbidity data, we present a network-based approach to predict candidate genes for lipid and lipoprotein traits. We apply a prediction pipeline incorporating interactome, co-expression, and comorbidity data to Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) GWAS for four traits of interest, identifying phenotypically coherent modules. These modules provide insights regarding gene involvement in complex phenotypes with multiple susceptibility alleles and low effect sizes. To experimentally test our predictions, we selected four candidate genes and genotyped representative SNPs in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort. We found significant associations with LDL-C and total-cholesterol levels for a synonymous SNP (rs234706) in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene (p = 1 × 10(-5) and adjusted-p = 0.013, respectively). Further, liver samples taken from 206 patients revealed that patients with the minor allele of rs234706 had significant dysregulation of CBS (p = 0.04). Despite the known biological role of CBS in lipid metabolism, SNPs within the locus have not yet been identified in GWAS of lipoprotein traits. Thus, the GWAS-based Comorbidity Module (GCM) approach identifies candidate genes missed by GWAS studies, serving as a broadly applicable tool for the investigation of other complex disease phenotypes.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mainly produced by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in vascular system, emerges as a novel gasotransmitter exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Alterations of CSE/H2S pathway may thus be involved in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study showed that the levels of CSE mRNA and protein expression, as well as H2S production were decreased in ox-LDL-treated macrophage. CSE overexpression reduced the ox-LDL-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) generation in Raw264.7 and primary macrophage while CSE knockdown enhanced it. Exogenous supplementation of H2S with NaHS and Na2S also decreased the production of TNF-a and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in ox-LDL-stimulated macrophage, and alleviated the adhesion of macrophage to endothelial monolayer. Cysteine, a CSE preferential substrate for H2S biosynthesis, produced similar effects on the pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, which were reversed by CSE inhibitors PAG and BCA, respectively. Moreover, NaHS and Na2S attenuated the phosphorylation and degradation of I<U+03BA>Ba and p65 nuclear translocation, as well as JNK activation caused by ox-LDL. The JNK inhibitor suppressed the NF-<U+03BA>B transcription activity in ox-LDL-treated cells. Furthermore, inhibitors of NF-<U+03BA>B (PDTC), ERK (U0126 and PD98059) and JNK (SP600125) partially blocked the suppression by ox-LDL on the CSE mRNA levels. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that ox-LDL may down-regulate the CSE/H2S pathway, which plays an anti-inflammatory role in ox-LDL-stimulated macrophage by suppressing JNK/NF-<U+03BA>B signaling. The study reveals new therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis, based on modulating CSE/H2S pathway.

Oxygen-sensitive accumulation and degradation, two opposite but intrinsically linked events, of heme proteins in mitochondria affect mitochondrial functions, including bioenergetics and oxygen-sensing processes. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) contains a prosthetic heme group and catalyzes the production of hydrogen sulfide in mammalian cells. Here we show that CBS proteins were present in liver mitochondria at a low level under normoxia conditions. Ischemia/hypoxia increased the accumulation of CBS proteins in mitochondria. The normalization of oxygen partial pressure accelerated the degradation of CBS proteins. Lon protease, a major degradation enzyme in mitochondrial matrix, recognized and degraded mitochondrial CBS by specifically targeting at the oxygenated heme group of CBS proteins. The accumulation of CBS in mitochondria increased hydrogen sulfide production, which prevented Ca(2+)-mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria and decreased reactive oxygen species generation. Mitochondrial accumulation of heme oxygenase-1, another heme protein, was also regulated by oxygen level and Lon protease in the same mechanism as for CBS. Our findings provide a fundamental and general mechanism for oxygen-sensitive regulation of mitochondrial functions by linking oxygenation level to the accumulation/degradation of mitochondrial heme proteins.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine plays a number of pathophysiological roles. Hyperhomocysteinemia is involved in kidney fibrosis. However, the role of H2S in kidney fibrosis remains to be defined. Here, we investigated the role of H2S and its acting mechanism in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UO)-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. UO decreased expressions of CBS and CSE in the kidney with decrease of H2S concentration. Treatment with sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, a H2S producer) during UO reduced UO-induced oxidative stress with preservations of catalase, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression, and glutathione level. In addition, NaHS mitigated decreases of CBS and CSE expressions, and H2S concentration in the kidney. NaHS treatment attenuated UO-induced increases in levels of TGF-ß1, activated Smad3, and activated NF-<U+03BA>B. This study provided the first evidence of involvement of the transsulfuration pathway and H2S in UO-induced kidney fibrosis, suggesting that H2S and its transsulfuration pathway may be a potential target for development of therapeutics for fibrosis-related diseases.

The physiological functions of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) include vasorelaxation, stimulation of cellular bioenergetics, and promotion of angiogenesis. Analysis of human colon cancer biopsies and patient-matched normal margin mucosa revealed the selective up-regulation of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) in colon cancer, resulting in an increased rate of H2S production. Similarly, colon cancer-derived epithelial cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, LoVo) exhibited selective CBS up-regulation and increased H2S production, compared with the nonmalignant colonic mucosa cells, NCM356. CBS localized to the cytosol, as well as the mitochondrial outer membrane. ShRNA-mediated silencing of CBS or its pharmacological inhibition with aminooxyacetic acid reduced HCT116 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; reduced endothelial cell migration in tumor/endothelial cell cocultures; and suppressed mitochondrial function (oxygen consumption, ATP turnover, and respiratory reserve capacity), as well as glycolysis. Treatment of nude mice with aminooxyacetic acid attenuated the growth of patient-derived colon cancer xenografts and reduced tumor blood flow. Similarly, CBS silencing of the tumor cells decreased xenograft growth and suppressed neovessel density, suggesting a role for endogenous H2S in tumor angiogenesis. In contrast to CBS, silencing of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (the expression of which was unchanged in colon cancer) did not affect tumor growth or bioenergetics. In conclusion, H2S produced from CBS serves to (i) maintain colon cancer cellular bioenergetics, thereby supporting tumor growth and proliferation, and (ii) promote angiogenesis and vasorelaxation, consequently providing the tumor with blood and nutritients. The current findings identify CBS-derived H2S as a tumor growth factor and anticancer drug target.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is poorly understood and treatment remains difficult. We have previously reported that TTX-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channels in colon-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were sensitized and the expression of the endogenous hydrogen sulfide producing enzyme cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) was upregulated in a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity induced by neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD). However, the detailed molecular mechanism for activation of sodium channels remains unknown. This study was designed to examine roles for CBS-H2S signaling in sensitization of sodium channels in a previously validated rat model of IBS.METHODS: Neonatal male rats (postnatal days 2-15) were exposed to a 3 hour period of daily maternal separation with temperature maintained at ~33 °C. Colon-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were labeled with DiI and acutely dissociated for measuring excitability and sodium channel current under whole-cell patch clamp configurations. The expression of Na(V)1.8 was analyzed by Western blot and Immunofluorescence study. The endogenous H2S producing enzyme CBS antagonist was injected intraperitoneally.RESULTS: We showed that CBS was colocalized with Na(V)1.8 in colon-specific DRG neurons pre-labeled with DiI. Pretreatment of O-(Carboxymethyl) hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (AOAA), an inhibitor of CBS, significantly reduced expression of Na(V)1.8 in NMD rats. AOAA treatment also inhibited the TTX-R sodium current density, right-shifted the V1/2 of activation curve, and reversed hyperexcitability of colon-specific DRG neurons in NMD rats. Conversely, addition of NaHS, a donor of H2S, greatly enhanced TTX-R sodium current density, left shifted the activation curve and enhanced excitability of colon DRG neurons in age-matched healthy rats. Furthermore, application of H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, markedly attenuated the potentiation of TTX-R sodium current density by NaHS.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that sensitization of sodium channels of colon DRG neurons in NMD rats is most likely mediated by CBS-H2S signaling, thus identifying a potential target for treatment for chronic visceral pain in patients with IBS.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter endogenously generated from the metabolism of L-cysteine by action of two main enzymes called cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). This gas has been involved in the pain processing and insulin resistance produced during diabetes development. However, there is no evidence about its participation in the peripheral neuropathy induced by this metabolic disorder. Experimental diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (50mg/kg, i.p.) in female Wistar rats. Streptozotocin injection increased formalin-evoked flinching in diabetic rats as compared to non-diabetic rats after 2 weeks. Peripheral administration of NaHS (an exogenous donor of H2S) and L-cysteine (an endogenous donor of H2S) dose-dependently increased flinching behavior in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Contrariwise, hydroxylamine (HA, a CBS inhibitor) and DL-propargylglycine (PPG, a CSE inhibitor) decreased formalin-induced nociceptive behavior in both experimental groups. In addition, an ineffective dose of HA and PPG partially prevented the L-cysteine-induced hyperalgesia in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Interestingly, HA and PPG were three order of magnitude more potent in diabetic rats respect to non-diabetic rats, whereas NaHS was ten times more potent in the streptozotocin-diabetic group. Nine to 11 weeks after diabetes induction, tactile allodynia was observed in the streptozotocin-injected rats. On this condition, subcutaneous administration of PPG or HA reduced tactile allodynia in diabetic rats. Paradoxically, H2S levels were decreased in nerve sciatic, dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord, but not paw nor blood plasma, during diabetes-associated peripheral neuropathy development. Collectively, results suggest that H2S synthesized by CBS and CSE participate in formalin-induced nociception in diabetic and non-diabetic rats, as well as; in tactile allodynia in streptozotocin-injected rats. In addition, data seems to indicate that diabetic rats are more sensible to H2S-induced hyperalgesia than normoglycemic rats.

Sulfur is the seventh most abundant element measurable in the human body and is supplied mainly by the intake of methionine (Met), an indispensable amino acid found in plant and animal proteins. Met controls the initiation of protein synthesis, governs major metabolic and catalytic activities, and may undergo reversible redox processes safeguarding protein integrity. Withdrawal of Met from customary diets causes the greatest downsizing of lean body mass following either unachieved replenishment (malnutrition) or excessive losses (inflammation). These physiopathologically unrelated morbidities nevertheless stimulate comparable remethylation reactions from homocysteine, indicating that Met homeostasis benefits from high metabolic priority. Inhibition of cystathionine-ß-synthase activity causes the upstream sequestration of homocysteine and the downstream drop in cysteine and glutathione. Consequently, the enzymatic production of hydrogen sulfide and the nonenzymatic reduction of elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide are impaired. Sulfur operates as cofactor of several enzymes critically involved in the regulation of oxidative processes. A combination of malnutrition and nutritional deprivation of sulfur maximizes the risk of cardiovascular disorders and stroke, constituting a novel clinical entity that threatens plant-eating population groups.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism first described almost 50 years ago, which involves the accumulation of plasma homocysteine and other metabolites. Without early detection and appropriate treatment, common and sometimes lethal consequences include ocular abnormalities, osteoporosis, developmental delays, marfanoid phenotype, vascular disease, and mental retardation. Almost 50% of subjects develop a psychiatric disorder during their life, but only 2.8% present a psychiatric symptom as the initial manifestation. Among this group, psychotic disorders are infrequent. We describe the case of a 17-year-old boy presenting with a first episode psychosis and an unknown homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency, which led to a lethal outcome.

Sulfhydryl groups on protein Cys residues undergo an array of oxidative reactions and modifications, giving rise to a virtual redox zip code with physiological and pathophysiological relevance for modulation of protein structure and functions. While over two decades of studies have established NO-dependent S-nitrosylation as ubiquitous and fundamental for the regulation of diverse protein activities, proteomic methods for studying H2S-dependent S-sulfhydration have only recently been described and now suggest that this is also an abundant modification with potential for global physiological importance. Notably, protein S-sulfhydration and S-nitrosylation bear striking similarities in terms of their chemical and biological determinants, as well as reversal of these modifications via group-transfer to glutathione, followed by the removal from glutathione by enzymes that have apparently evolved to selectively catalyze denitrosylation and desulfhydration. Here we review determinants of protein and low-molecular-weight thiol S-sulfhydration/desulfhydration, similarities with S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation, and methods that are being employed to investigate and quantify these gasotransmitter-mediated cell signaling systems.

It has been known that silymarin exhibits protective activity against oxidative liver injury induced by various hepatotoxicants, but the underlying mechanism of its beneficial action remains unclear. We determined the alterations in sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism induced by silymarin in association with its effects on the antioxidant capacity of liver. Male mice were treated with silymarin (100 or 200 mg/kg, p. o.) every 12 h for a total of 3 doses, and sacrificed 6 h after the final dosing. The hepatic methionine level was increased, but the activity and protein expression of methionine adenosyltransferase were decreased by silymarin in a dose-dependent manner. S-Adenosylmethionine or homocysteine concentration was not changed, whereas the sulfur-containing metabolites generated from homocysteine in the transsulfuration pathway including cystathionine, cysteine, and glutathione were increased significantly. Cystathionine ß-synthase was induced, but cysteine dioxygenase was downregulated, both of which would contribute to the elevation of cysteine and its product, glutathione, in liver. Oxygen radical scavenging capacity of liver cytosol against peroxyl radical and peroxynitrite was increased, and also hepatic lipid peroxidation was diminished in the silymarin-treated mice. Taken together, the results demonstrate that silymarin enhances hepatic glutathione generation by elevating cysteine availability via an increment in cysteine synthesis and an inhibition of its catabolism to taurine, which may subsequently contribute to the antioxidant defense of liver.

3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) is an important enzyme for the synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the brain. We present here data that indicate an exclusively localization of 3MST in astrocytes. Regional distribution of 3MST activities is even and unremarkable. Following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), 3MST was down-regulated in both the cortex and striatum, but not in the corpus collosum. It appears that the down-regulation of astrocytic 3MST persisted in the presence of astrocytic proliferation due to gliosis. Our observations indicate that 3MST is probably not responsible for the increased production of H2S following pMCAO. Therefore, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), the alternative H2S producing enzyme in the CNS, remains as a more likely potential therapeutic target than 3MST in the treatment of acute stroke through inhibition of H2S production.

Sensitization is a form of non-associative conditioning in which amplification of behavioral responses can occur following presentation of an aversive or noxious stimulus. Understanding the cellular and molecular underpinnings of sensitization has been an overarching theme spanning the field of learning and memory as well as that of pain research. In this review we examine how sensitization, both in the context of learning as well as pain processing, shares evolutionarily conserved behavioral, cellular/synaptic, and epigenetic mechanisms across phyla. First, we characterize the behavioral phenomenon of sensitization both in invertebrates and vertebrates. Particular emphasis is placed on long-term sensitization (LTS) of withdrawal reflexes in Aplysia following aversive stimulation or injury, although additional invertebrate models are also covered. In the context of vertebrates, sensitization of mammalian hyperarousal in a model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as mammalian models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain is characterized. Second, we investigate the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying these behaviors. We focus our discussion on serotonin-mediated long-term facilitation (LTF) and axotomy-mediated long-term hyperexcitability (LTH) in reduced Aplysia systems, as well as mammalian spinal plasticity mechanisms of central sensitization. Third, we explore recent evidence implicating epigenetic mechanisms in learning- and pain-related sensitization. This review illustrates the fundamental and functional overlay of the learning and memory field with the pain field which argues for homologous persistent plasticity mechanisms in response to sensitizing stimuli or injury across phyla.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine or cysteine to form cystathionine and water or hydrogen sulfide (H2S), respectively. In addition to pyridoxal phosphate, human CBS has a heme cofactor with cysteine and histidine as ligands. While Fe(III)-CBS is inert to exogenous ligands, Fe(II)-CBS can be reversibly inhibited by carbon monoxide (CO) and reoxidized by O2 to yield superoxide radical. In this study, we have examined the kinetics of Fe(II)CO-CBS formation and reoxidation. Reduction of Fe(III)-CBS by dithionite showed a square root dependence on concentration, indicating that the reductant species was the sulfur dioxide radical anion (SO2(-)) that exists in rapid equilibrium with S2O4(2-). Formation of Fe(II)CO-CBS from Fe(II)-CBS and 1 mM CO occurred with a rate constant of (3.1 ± 0.4) × 10(-3) s(-1) (pH 7.4, 25 °C). The reaction of Fe(III)-CBS with the reduced form of the flavoprotein methionine synthase reductase in the presence of CO and NADPH resulted in its reduction and carbonylation to form Fe(II)CO-CBS. Fe(II)-CBS was formed as an intermediate with a rate constant of (9.3 ± 2.5) × 10(2) M(-1) s(-1). Reoxidation of Fe(II)CO-CBS by O2 was multiphasic. The major phase showed a hyperbolic dependence on O2 concentration. Although H2S is a product of the CBS reaction and a potential heme ligand, we did not find evidence of an effect of exogenous H2S on activity or heme binding. Reversible reduction of CBS by a physiologically relevant oxidoreductase is consistent with a regulatory role for the heme and could constitute a mechanism for cross talk among the CO, H2S, and superoxide signaling pathways.

BACKGROUND: PRKAG2 gene encodes the <U+03B3>2 regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status, and its germline mutations are responsible for PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome (PCS). The majority of missense mutations of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains found in PCS impair the binding activity of PRKAG2 to adenosine derivatives, and therefore lead to PRKAG2 function impairment and AMPK activity alteration, resulting in a familial syndrome of ventricular preexcitation, conduction defects, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, it is unclear about the PRKAG2 mutation in the non-CBS domain. Here, a Chinese family exhibiting the cardiac syndrome associated with a novel heterozygous PRKAG2 mutation (Gly100Ser) mapped to exon 3 encoding a non-CBS domain is described and the function of this novel mutation was investigated in vitro.METHODS: The PRKAG2 G100S and R302Q mutations were constructed by a two-step polymerase chain reaction and then transfected into CCL13 cells by lentivirus vectors. Wild-type PRKAG2 gene transfection was used as a negative control. PRKAG2 expression was determined by Western blot. Immunofluorescence was used to localize the intracellular PRKAG2 proteins. MTT assay was performed to explore the effect of mutations on cell proliferation. Periodic acid-Schiff staining was used for detecting glycogen accumulation. AMPK concentration was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Our results showed neither intracellular localization of PRKAG2 nor cell growth was altered. In contrast, PRKAG2 protein expression levels were significantly reduced by this mutation. Furthermore, PRKAG2-mediated activity of AMPK was attenuated, resulting in glycogen metabolism dysregulation. These findings revealed that non-CBS domains of PRKAG2 were essential to the regulation of AMPK activity, similar to CBS.CONCLUSIONS: Our study ascribes a crucial regulatory role to the novel PRKAG2 G100S mutation, and reiterates that PCS occurs as a consequence of AMPK signaling abnormality caused by PRKAG2 gene mutations.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a disease affecting million of patients worldwide. Though traditional cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with the development of PAD, the possible existence of an inherited genetic predisposition to PAD has been investigated in few familial aggregation studies. A link between genetics and PAD may open new avenues for the prevention of this morbid and mortal disorder.AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate a possible role of some genetic determinant involving into coagulation and homocysteine metabolism in the progression of PAD.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We follow one-hundred patients affected by PAD for six years. We evaluated Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) two times; first at the time of recruitment and then after six years, in order to assess the progression of disease. Genotypes for the genes of Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin or Factor II G20210A, Cystathionine Beta-Synthase 844ins68bp and Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase C677T was ascertained after taking blood samples. Chi-square test was performed to determinate the possible correlation of these genes and the most common environmental factors in the progression of PAD.RESULTS: Genetic disorders resulting in high level of homocysteina or thrombophilic phenotype are not so frequent. None among the genetic factors we considered were correlated with PAD.CONCLUSION: PAD is a chronic disease whose course can be slowed down especially with the control of environmental risk factors. Genetic analyses are not useful to determine the disease progression or its tendency to remain stable.

BACKGROUND: Owing to recent discoveries of many hydrogen sulfide-mediated physiological processes, sulfide biology is in the focus of scientific research. However, the promiscuous chemical properties of sulfide pose complications for biological studies, which led to accumulation of controversial observations in the literature.SCOPE OF REVIEW: We intend to provide an overview of fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic features of sulfide redox- and coordination-chemical reactions and protonation equilibria in relation to its biological functions. In light of these chemical properties we review the strengths and limitations of the most commonly used sulfide detection methods and recently developed fluorescent probes. We also give a personal perspective on blood and tissue sulfide measurements based on proposed biomolecule-sulfide interactions and point out important chemical aspects of handling sulfide reagent solutions.MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The diverse chemistries of sulfide detection methods resulted in orders of magnitude differences in measured physiological sulfide levels. Investigations that were aimed to dissect the underlying molecular reasons responsible for these controversies made the important recognition that there are large sulfide reserves in biological systems. These sulfide pools are tightly regulated in a dynamic manner and they are likely to play a major role in regulation of endogenous-sulfide-mediated biological functions and avoiding toxic side effects.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Working with sulfide is challenging, because it requires considerable amounts of chemical knowledge to adequately handle reagent sulfide solutions and interpret biological observations. Therefore, we propose that a rigorous chemical approach could aid the reconciliation of the increasing number of controversies in sulfide biology.

Ecological evidence suggests that niacin (nicotinamide and nicotinic acid) fortification may be involved in the increased prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, both of which are associated with insulin resistance and epigenetic changes. The purpose of the present study was to investigate nicotinamide-induced metabolic changes and their relationship with possible epigenetic changes. Male rats (5 weeks old) were fed with a basal diet (control group) or diets supplemented with 1 or 4 g/kg of nicotinamide for 8 weeks. Low-dose nicotinamide exposure increased weight gain, but high-dose one did not. The nicotinamide-treated rats had higher hepatic and renal levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a marker of DNA damage, and impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity when compared with the control rats. Nicotinamide supplementation increased the plasma levels of nicotinamide, N1-methylnicotinamide and choline and decreased the levels of betaine, which is associated with a decrease in global hepatic DNA methylation and uracil content in DNA. Nicotinamide had gene-specific effects on the methylation of CpG sites within the promoters and the expression of hepatic genes tested that are responsible for methyl transfer reactions (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase and DNA methyltransferase 1), for homocysteine metabolism (betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, methionine synthase and cystathionine ß-synthase) and for oxidative defence (catalase and tumour protein p53). It is concluded that nicotinamide-induced oxidative tissue injury, insulin resistance and disturbed methyl metabolism can lead to epigenetic changes. The present study suggests that long-term high nicotinamide intake (e.g. induced by niacin fortification) may be a risk factor for methylation- and insulin resistance-related metabolic abnormalities.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a multifunctional signaling molecule that exerts neuroprotective effects in oxidative stress. In this article, we report a mitochondria-localized two-photon probe, SHS-M2, that can be excited by 750 nm femtosecond pulses and employed for ratiometric detection of H2S in live astrocytes and living brain slices using two-photon microscopy (TPM). SHS-M2 shows bright two-photon-excited fluorescence and a marked change in emission color from blue to yellow in response to H2S, low cytotoxicity, easy loading, and minimum interference from other biologically relevant species including reactive sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen species, thereby allowing quantitative analysis of H2S levels. Molecular TPM imaging with SHS-M2 in astrocytes revealed that there is a correlation between the ratiometric analysis and expression levels of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), the major enzyme that catalyzes H2S production. In studies involving DJ-1, a Parkinson's disease (PD) gene, attenuated H2S production in comparison with wild-type controls was observed in DJ-1-knockout astrocytes and brain slices, where CBS expression was decreased. These findings demonstrate that reduced H2S levels in astrocytes may contribute to the development of PD and that SHS-M2 may be useful as a marker to detect a risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.

Homocysteine is an amino acid, which plays several important roles in human physiology. A wide range of disorders, including neuropsychiatric disorders and autism, are associated with increased homocysteine levels in biological fluids. Various B vitamins: B6 (pyridoxine), B12 (cobalamin), and B9 (folic acid) are required as co-factors by the enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism. Therefore, monitoring of homocysteine levels in body fluids of autistic children can provide information on genetic and physiological diseases, improper lifestyle (including dietary habits), as well as a variety of pathological conditions. This review presents information on homocysteine metabolism, determination of homocysteine in biological fluids, and shows abnormalities in the levels of homocysteine in the body fluids of autistic children.

We describe a family illustrating the diagnostic difficulties occurring when pyridoxine-responsive cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency presents with thrombotic disease without associated ocular, skeletal, or CNS abnormalities, a situation increasingly recognized. This family had several thromboembolic episodes in two generations with apparently inconstant elevations of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy). When taking (sometimes even low amounts) of pyridoxine, the affected family members had low-normal tHcy and normal values for cystathionine, methionine, and cysteine. Withdrawal of vitamin therapy was necessary before lower cystathionine, elevated methionine, and decreased cysteine became apparent, a pattern suggestive of CBS deficiency, leading to the finding that the affected members were each compound heterozygotes for CBS p.G307S and p.P49L. To assist more accurate diagnosis of adults presenting with thrombophilia found to have elevated tHcy, the patterns of methionine-related metabolites in CBS-deficient patients are compared in this article to those in patients with homocysteine remethylation defects, including inborn errors of folate or cobalamin metabolism, and untreated severe cobalamin or folate deficiency. Usually serum cystathionine is low in subjects with CBS deficiency and elevated in those with remethylation defects. S-Adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine are often markedly elevated in CBS deficiency when tHcy is above 100 umol/L. We conclude that there are likely other undiagnosed, highly B6-responsive adult patients with CBS deficiency, and that additional testing of cystathionine, total cysteine, methionine, and S-adenosylmethionine will be helpful in diagnosing them correctly and distinguishing CBS deficiency from remethylation defects.

We investigated the expression of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in human and rat lower urinary tract (including bladder, prostate and urethra) tissues, and we sought to determine whether H2S induces relaxation of human and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat bladder strips. Human normal lower urinary tract tissue was obtained for the evaluation of endogenous H2S productivity using a sulphide-sensitive electrode and for the analysis of the expression levels of all three synthases of endogenous H2S, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphur transferase (MPST, as known as 3-MST) by Western blot assay. CBS, CSE and MPST were located in human sample slides by immunohistochemistry. Human and male adult SD rat bladder strips were tested for H2S function with a transducer and recorded. All experiments were repeated six times. The endogenous H2S productivity and the H2S synthases had various distributions in the human and rat lower urinary tract tissues and were located in both epithelial and stromal sections. L-cysteine (L-Cys, a substrate of CBS, CSE and MPST) elicited relaxation in a dose-dependent manner on human bladder strips pre-contracted by acetylcholine chloride. This effect could be diminished by the ATP-sensitive potassium ion (KATP) channel blocker glibenclamide (GLB), the CSE inhibitor DL-propargylglycine (PPG) and the CBS inhibitor hydroxylamine (HA). H2S and its three synthases were present in the human and rat lower urinary tract tissues and relaxed human and rat bladder strips, which implied that endogenous H2S might play a role in physiological function and pathological disorders of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or overactive bladder (OAB).

Previously, we reported that Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and gastric cancer are closely associated with increased levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and that Korean red ginseng significantly reduced the severity of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases by attenuating H2S generation. Because the incubation of endothelial cells with H2S has been known to enhance their angiogenic activities, we hypothesized that the amelioration of H2S-induced gastric inflammation or angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) might explain the preventive effect of Korean red ginseng on H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis. The expression of inflammatory mediators, angiogenic growth factors, and angiogenic activities in the absence or presence of Korean red ginseng extracts (KRGE) were evaluated in HUVECs stimulated with the H2S generator sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS). KRGE efficiently decreased the expression of cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, enzymes that are essential for H2S synthesis. Concomitantly, a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators, including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and several angiogenic factors, including interleukin (IL)-8, hypoxia inducible factor-1a, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinases, was observed; all of these factors are normally induced after NaHS. An in vitro angiogenesis assay demonstrated that NaHS significantly increased tube formation in endothelial cells, whereas KRGE pretreatment significantly attenuated tube formation. NaHS activated p38 and Akt, increasing the expression of angiogenic factors and the proliferation of HUVECs, whereas KRGE effectively abrogated this H2S-activated angiogenesis and the increase in inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, KRGE was able to mitigate H2S-induced angiogenesis, implying that antagonistic action against H2S-induced angiogenesis may be the mechanism underlying the gastric cancer preventive effects of KRGE in H. pylori infection.

Changes in sulfur-based redox metabolite profiles in multiple tissues of long-lived Snell dwarf mice were compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Plasma methionine and its oxidation products, hypotaurine and taurine, were increased in Snell dwarfs while cystine and glutathione levels were decreased, leading to an oxidative shift in the redox potential. Sexual dimorphism in renal cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) activity was observed in control mice but not in Snell dwarfs. Instead, female Snell mice exhibited ~2-fold higher CBS activity, comparable to levels seen in male Snell dwarf and in control mice. Taurine levels were significantly higher in kidney and brain of Snell dwarf versus control mice. Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) was higher in liver of Snell dwarfs, and the higher concentration of its product, S-adenosylmethionine, was correlated with elevated global DNA methylation status. Application of a mathematical model for methionine metabolism revealed that the metabolite perturbations in Snell dwarfs could be explained by decreased methionine transport, increased MAT and increased methyltransferase activity. Our study provides a comprehensive map of systemic differences in the sulfur network between Snell dwarfs and controls, providing the necessary foundation for assessment of nutrition-linked metabolic status in long-lived versus control animals.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD) is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) in alcohol induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key mechanism of ALD.METHODS: We examined ER stress, lipogenesis, hyperhomocysteinemia, mitochondrial cholesterol (mChol) trafficking and susceptibility to LPS and concanavalin-A in ASMase(-)(/-) mice fed alcohol.RESULTS: Alcohol feeding increased SREBP-1c, DGAT-2, and FAS mRNA in ASMase(+/+) but not in ASMase(-/-) mice. Compared to ASMase(+/+) mice, ASMase(-/-) mice exhibited decreased expression of ER stress markers induced by alcohol, but the level of tunicamycin-mediated upregulation of ER stress markers and steatosis was similar in both types of mice. The increase in homocysteine levels induced by alcohol feeding was comparable in both ASMase(+/+) and ASMase(-/-) mice. Exogenous ASMase, but not neutral SMase, induced ER stress by perturbing ER Ca(2+) homeostasis. Moreover, alcohol-induced mChol loading and StARD1 overexpression were blunted in ASMase(-/-) mice. Tunicamycin upregulated StARD1 expression and this outcome was abrogated by tauroursodeoxycholic acid. Alcohol-induced liver injury and sensitization to LPS and concanavalin-A were prevented in ASMase(-/-) mice. These effects were reproduced in alcohol-fed TNFR1/R2(-/-) mice. Moreover, ASMase does not impair hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Of relevance, liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis exhibited increased expression of ASMase, StARD1, and ER stress markers.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ASMase is critical for alcohol-induced ER stress, and provide a rationale for further clinical investigation in ALD.

Werner syndrome (WS) protein is involved in DNA repair and its truncation causes Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with a premature aging phenotype. WRN protein mutation is currently known as the primary cause of WS. In cultured WS fibroblasts, we found an increase in cytosolic aggregates and hypothesized that the phenotype is indirectly related to an excess activation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, leading to the formation of protein aggregates in the cytosol with increasing levels of oxidative stress. As we found that the expression levels of the two main H2S producing enzymes, cystathionine ß synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase, were lower in WS cells compared to normal, we investigated the effect of administration of H2S as NaHS (50µM). NaHS treatment blocked mTOR activity, abrogated protein aggregation and normalized the phenotype of WS cells. Similar results were obtained by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. This is the first report suggesting that hydrogen sulfide administered as NaHS restores proteostasis and cellular morphological phenotype of WS cells and hints to the importance of transsulfuration pathway in WS.

Patients with long-standing diabetes frequently demonstrate gastric hypersensitivity with an unknown mechanism. The present study was designed to investigate roles for nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and the endogenous H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS) signaling pathways by examining cbs gene methylation status in adult rats with diabetes. Intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) produced gastric hypersensitivity in female rats in response to gastric balloon distention. Treatment with the CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid significantly attenuated STZ-induced gastric hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent fashion. Aminooxyacetic acid treatment also reversed hyperexcitability of gastric-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons labeled by the dye DiI in diabetic rats. Conversely, the H2S donor NaHS enhanced neuronal excitability of gastric DRG neurons. Expression of CBS and p65 were markedly enhanced in gastric DRGs in diabetic rats. Blockade of NF-<U+03BA>B signaling using pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate reversed the upregulation of CBS expression. Interestingly, STZ treatment led to a significant demethylation of CpG islands in the cbs gene promoter region, as determined by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. STZ treatment also remarkably downregulated the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3a and 3b. More importantly, STZ treatment significantly enhanced the ability of cbs to bind DNA at the p65 consensus site, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our findings suggest that upregulation of cbs expression is attributed to cbs promoter DNA demethylation and p65 activation and that the enhanced interaction of the cbs gene and p65 contributes to gastric hypersensitivity in diabetes. This finding may guide the development and evaluation of new treatment modalities for patients with diabetic gastric hypersensitivity.

Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) is a source of endogenous H2S, a gaseous signaling molecule implicated in a wide range of physiological processes. The contribution of MST versus the other two H2S generators, cystathionine ß-synthase and <U+03B3>-cystathionase, has been difficult to evaluate because many studies on MST have been conducted at high pH and have used varied reaction conditions. In this study, we have expressed, purified, and crystallized human MST in the presence of the substrate 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP). The kinetics of H2S production by MST from 3-MP was studied at pH 7.4 in the presence of various physiological persulfide acceptors: cysteine, dihydrolipoic acid, glutathione, homocysteine, and thioredoxin, and in the presence of cyanide. The crystal structure of MST reveals a mixture of the product complex containing pyruvate and an active site cysteine persulfide (Cys(248)-SSH) and a nonproductive intermediate in which 3-MP is covalently linked via a disulfide bond to an active site cysteine. The crystal structure analysis allows us to propose a detailed mechanism for MST in which an Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad is positioned to activate the nucleophilic cysteine residue and participate in general acid-base chemistry, whereas our kinetic analysis indicates that thioredoxin is likely to be the major physiological persulfide acceptor for MST.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a risk factor for cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study was to determine the temporal pattern of cerebral pathology in a mouse model of mild HHcy, because understanding this time course provides the basis for understanding the mechanisms involved. C57Bl/6 mice with heterozygous deletion cystathionine ß-synthase (cbs (+/-); Het) were used as a model of mild HHcy along with their wild-type littermates (cbs (+/+); WT). Mice were 'young' (5.3±0.2 months of age) and 'old' (16.6±0.9 months of age). Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was quantified from Evans blue and sodium fluorescein extravasation. Microvascular architecture was assessed by z-stack confocal microscopy. Leukoaraiosis was measured from Luxol fast blue stained slides of paraffin brain sections. Inflammation was quantified using standard antibody-based immunohistochemical techniques. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze. BBB permeability was significantly greater in Het vs. WT mice at all ages (p&lt;0.05). There were no differences in microvascular architecture among the groups. Compared with all other groups, old Het mice had significantly greater leukoaraiosis, inflammation in the fornix, and cognitive impairment (p&lt;0.05). In mild HHcy, increased permeability of the BBB precedes the onset of cerebral pathology. This new paradigm may play a role in the progression of disease in HHcy.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an inherited disorder of the metabolism of methionine. Clinical manifestations include mental retardation, dislocation of the optic lens, vascular lesions, arterial and venous thromboembolism, skeletal abnormalities, and osteoporosis. Most homocystinuria patients diagnosed in adulthood have severe osteoporosis, and homocystinuria is frequently mentioned as a cause of osteoporosis. Good control of plasma homocysteine may prevent or delay some of these complications. However, the effectiveness of bone mineral density (BMD) gain or fracture prevention has not been addressed. Here, we describe changes in BMD and body composition in 5 CBS deficiency patients who were diagnosed at young age and were managed with good metabolic control. We found that the BMD of each region was within the normal range. BMD gain was adequate and the patients had no significant change in skeletal morphology.

SIGNIFICANCE: Ventilatory responses to hypoxia are initiated by the carotid body, where inhibition of specific K(+) channels causes cell depolarization, voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx, and neurotransmitter release. The identity of the upstream oxygen (O2) sensor is still controversial.RECENT ADVANCES: The activity of BKCa channels is regulated by O2, carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), suggesting that integration of these signals may be crucial to the physiological response of this tissue. BKCa is colocalized with hemeoxygenase-2, an enzyme that generates CO in the presence of O2, and CO is a BKCa channel opener. Reduced CO during hypoxia results in channel closure, conferring a degree of O2 sensitivity to the BKCa channel. Conversely, H2S is a potent BKCa inhibitor. H2S is produced endogenously by cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase in the rat carotid body, and its intracellular concentration is dependent upon the balance between its enzymatic generation and its mitochondrial breakdown. During hypoxia, mitochondrial oxidation of H2S in many tissues is reduced, leading to hypoxia-evoked rises in its concentration. This may be sufficient to inhibit K(+) channels and lead to carotid body excitation.CRITICAL ISSUES: Carotid body function is heavily dependent upon regulated production and breakdown of CO and H2S and integration of signals from these newly emerging gasotransmitters, in combination with several other proposed mechanisms, may refine, or even define, responses of this tissue to hypoxia.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Since several other sensors have been postulated, the challenge of future research is to begin to integrate each in a unifying mechanism, as has been attempted for the first time herein.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies and correlate with severity of heart failure in cross-sectional surveys. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a selective homocysteine lowering intervention beneficially affects cardiac remodelling and cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) in a murine model of combined hypercholesterolemia and hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer strategy was evaluated in female C57BL/6 low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)<U+207B>/<U+207B> cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs)<U+207A>/<U+207B> deficient mice fed a hyperhomocysteinemic and high saturated fat/high cholesterol diet using an E1E3E4-deleted hepatocyte-specific adenoviral vector expressing Cbs (AdCBS). MI was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery 14 days after saline injection or gene transfer. AdCBS gene transfer resulted in a persistent more than 5-fold (p&lt;0.01) decrease of plasma homocysteine levels and significantly improved endothelial progenitor cell function. Selective homocysteine lowering enhanced infarct healing as indicated by a 21% (p&lt;0.01) reduction of infarct length at day 28 after MI and by an increased number of capillaries and increased collagen content in the infarct zone. Adverse remodelling was attenuated in AdCBS MI mice as evidenced by a 29% (p&lt;0.05) reduction of left ventricular cavity area at day 28, by an increased capillary density in the remote myocardium, and by reduced interstitial collagen. The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 19% (p&lt;0.05) and the time constant of left ventricular relaxation was reduced by 21% (p&lt;0.05) in AdCBS MI mice compared to control MI mice, indicating improved diastolic function.SIGNIFICANCE: Selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer improves infarct healing, attenuates remodelling, and significantly enhances diastolic function post-MI in female C57BL/6 Ldlr<U+207B>/<U+207B> Cbs<U+207A>/<U+207B> mice. The current study corroborates the view that hyperhomocysteinemia exerts direct effects on the myocardium and may potentiate the development of heart failure.

Elevated plasma homocysteine has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic liver disease, which are major complications of diabetes. Hence, hepatic homocysteine metabolism has become a major focus of diabetes research. However, little information is available regarding plasma homocysteine levels in non-obese diabetic animals. Therefore, we investigated the hepatic metabolism of sulfur-amino acids in non-obese type-2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats. The experiments were performed using 9-week-old Goto-Kakizaki rats and age-matched Wistar rats. The major finding of this study is that homocysteine levels in the liver and plasma are maintained by a balance between the up-regulation of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase and the inhibition of cystathionine ß-synthase in non-obese type-2 diabetic rats. Hepatic levels of cysteine and its metabolites, such as hypotaurine, taurine, and glutathione, were increased despite inhibition of the transsulfuration of homocysteine to cysteine. The elevated hepatic taurine and glutathione levels may be attributed to the up-regulation of cysteine dioxygenase expression and increased cysteine availability for glutathione synthesis. Inhibition of hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase activity in Goto-Kakizaki rats was associated with a decrease in hepatic S-adenosylmethionine, which serves as an allosteric activator of cystathionine ß-synthase. The non-obese type-2 diabetic condition results in profound changes in hepatic sulfur-amino acid metabolism and raises the possibility that sulfur-amino acid metabolism may be regulated by obesity- as well as diabetes-associated factors. Further study to elucidate the pathological significance of sulfur-amino acid metabolism in chronic liver disease in type-2 diabetic animals is underway in this laboratory.



#### Pleiotropic effects of methionine adenosyltransferases deregulation as determinants of liver cancer progression and prognosis.

Downregulation of liver-specific MAT1A gene, encoding S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesizing isozymes MATI/III, and upregulation of widely expressed MAT2A, encoding MATII isozyme, known as MAT1A:MAT2A switch, occurs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Being inhibited by its reaction product, MATII isoform upregulation cannot compensate for MATI/III decrease. Therefore, MAT1A:MAT2A switch contributes to decrease in SAM level in rodent and human hepatocarcinogenesis. SAM administration to carcinogen-treated rats prevents hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas MAT1A-KO mice, characterized by chronic SAM deficiency, exhibit macrovesicular steatosis, mononuclear cell infiltration in periportal areas, and HCC development. This review focuses upon the pleiotropic changes, induced by MAT1A/MAT2A switch, associated with HCC development. Epigenetic control of MATs expression occurs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In HCC cells, MAT1A/MAT2A switch is associated with global DNA hypomethylation, decrease in DNA repair, genomic instability, and signaling deregulation including c-MYC overexpression, rise in polyamine synthesis, upregulation of RAS/ERK, IKK/NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, and LKB1/AMPK axis. Furthermore, decrease in MAT1A expression and SAM levels results in increased HCC cell proliferation, cell survival, and microvascularization. All of these changes are reversed by SAM treatment in vivo or forced MAT1A overexpression or MAT2A inhibition in cultured HCC cells. In human HCC, MAT1A:MAT2A and MATI/III:MATII ratios correlate negatively with cell proliferation and genomic instability, and positively with apoptosis and global DNA methylation. This suggests that SAM decrease and MATs deregulation represent potential therapeutic targets for HCC. Finally, MATI/III:MATII ratio strongly predicts patients' survival length suggesting that MAT1A:MAT2A expression ratio is a putative prognostic marker for human HCC. 



#### Change in single cystathionine ß-synthase domain-containing protein from a bent to flat conformation upon adenosine monophosphate binding.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) domains are small intracellular modules that can act as binding domains for adenosine derivatives, and they may regulate the activity of associated enzymes or other functional domains. Among these, the single CBS domain-containing proteins, CBSXs, from Arabidopsis thaliana, have recently been identified as redox regulators of the thioredoxin system. Here, the crystal structure of CBSX2 in complex with adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is reported at 2.2Å resolution. The structure of dimeric CBSX2 with bound-AMP is shown to be approximately flat, which is in stark contrast to the bent form of apo-CBSXs. This conformational change in quaternary structure is triggered by a local structural change of the unique a5 helix, and by moving each loop P into an open conformation to accommodate incoming ligands. Furthermore, subtle rearrangement of the dimer interface triggers movement of all subunits, and consequently, the bent structure of the CBSX2 dimer becomes a flat structure. This reshaping of the structure upon complex formation with adenosine-containing ligand provides evidence that ligand-induced conformational reorganization of antiparallel CBS domains is an important regulatory mechanism.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) causes adverse remodeling, whereas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) rescues organs in vascular diseases. The involvement of MMP-9 and H2S in diabetic renovascular remodeling is, however, not well characterized. We determined whether MMP-9 regulates H2S generation and whether H2S modulates connexin through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)-mediated pathway in the diabetic kidney. Wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J), diabetic (Akita, C57BL/6J-Ins2(Akita)), MMP-9(-/-) (M9KO), double knockout (DKO) of Akita/MMP-9(-/-) mice and in vitro cell culture were used in our study. Hyperglycemic Akita mice exhibited increased level of MMP-9 and decreased production of H2S. H2S-synthesizing enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase were also diminished. In addition, increased expressions of NMDA-R1 and connexin-40 and -43 were observed in diabetic kidney. As expected, MMP-9 mRNA was not detected in M9KO kidneys. However, very thin protein expression and activity were detected. No other changes were noticed in M9KO kidney. In DKO mice, all the above molecules showed a trend toward baseline despite hyperglycemia. In vitro, glomerular endothelial cells treated with high glucose showed induction of MMP-9, attenuated H2S production, NMDA-R1 induction, and dysregulated conexin-40 and -43 expressions. Silencing MMP-9 by siRNA or inhibition of NMDA-R1 by MK801 or H2S treatment preserved connexin-40 and -43. We conclude that in diabetic renovascular remodeling MMP-9 plays a major role and that H2S has therapeutic potential to prevent adverse diabetic renal remodeling.

8-Nitroguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP) is a unique derivative of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) formed in mammalian and plant cells in response to production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species. 8-Nitro-cGMP possesses signaling activity inherited from parental cGMP, including induction of vasorelaxation through activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. On the other hand, 8-nitro-cGMP mediates cellular signaling that is not observed for native cGMP, e.g., it behaves as an electrophile and reacts with protein sulfhydryls, which results in cGMP adduction to protein sulfhydryls (protein S-guanylation). Several proteins have been identified as targets for endogenous protein S-guanylation, including Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), H-Ras, and mitochondrial heat shock proteins. 8-Nitro-cGMP signaling via protein S-guanylation of those proteins may have evolved to convey adaptive cellular stress responses. 8-Nitro-cGMP may not undergo conventional cGMP metabolism because of its resistance to phosphodiesterases. Hydrogen sulfide has recently been identified as a potent regulator for metabolisms of electrophiles including 8-nitro-cGMP, through sulfhydration of electrophiles, e.g., leading to the formation of 8-SH-cGMP. Better understanding of the molecular basis for the formation, signaling functions, and metabolisms of 8-nitro-cGMP would be useful for the development of new diagnostic approaches and treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress and redox metabolisms.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a potentially toxic gas, is also an important signaling molecule in various mammalian cells and tissues. H2S is involved in the neuroprotection, neuromodulation, cardioprotection, vasodilatation and the regulation of inflammatory response. In pancreatic beta-cells, H2S can be produced by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). The produced H2S inhibits insulin release and regulates beta-cell survival. We demonstrated that glucose stimulation increase CSE expression in mouse pancreatic islets. We also indicated that H2S protects beta-cells that are chronically exposed to high glucose. Loss of beta-cell mass is important in the pathogenesis and/or progression of diabetes mellitus; therefore, molecular analyses of the mechanisms of H2S production and its protective effects on beta-cells may lead to new insights into diabetes mellitus.

Seedlings of Citrus sinensis were fertilized with boron (B)-deficient (0µM H3BO3) or -sufficient (10µM H3BO3) nutrient solution for 15weeks. Thereafter, iTRAQ analysis was employed to compare the abundances of proteins from B-deficient and -sufficient roots. In B-deficient roots, 164 up-regulated and 225 down-regulated proteins were identified. These proteins were grouped into the following functional categories: protein metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, stress responses, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, cell transport, cell wall and cytoskeleton metabolism, biological regulation and signal transduction, and lipid metabolism. The adaptive responses of roots to B-deficiency might include following several aspects: (a) decreasing root respiration; (b) improving the total ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (c) enhancing cell transport. The differentially expressed proteins identified by iTRAQ are much larger than those detected using 2D gel electrophoresis, and many novel B-deficiency-responsive proteins involved in cell transport, biological regulation and signal transduction, stress responses and other metabolic processes were identified in this work. Our results indicate remarkable metabolic flexibility of citrus roots, which may contribute to the survival of B-deficient plants. This represents the most comprehensive analysis of protein profiles in response to B-deficiency.</AbstractText>: Seedlings of Citrus sinensis were fertilized with boron (B)-deficient (0µM H3BO3) or -sufficient (10µM H3BO3) nutrient solution for 15weeks.

SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by the desulfuration of cysteine or homocysteine, functions as a signaling molecule in an array of physiological processes including regulation of vascular tone, the cellular stress response, apoptosis, and inflammation.RECENT ADVANCES: The low steady-state levels of H2S in mammalian cells have been recently shown to reflect a balance between its synthesis and its clearance. The subversion of enzymes in the cytoplasmic trans-sulfuration pathway for producing H2S from cysteine and/or homocysteine versus producing cysteine from homocysteine, presents an interesting regulatory problem.CRITICAL ISSUES: It is not known under what conditions the enzymes operate in the canonical trans-sulfuration pathway and how their specificity is switched to catalyze the alternative H2S-producing reactions. Similarly, it is not known if and whether the mitochondrial enzymes, which oxidize sulfide and persulfide (or sulfane sulfur), are regulated to increase or decrease H2S or sulfane-sulfur pools.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: In this review, we focus on the enzymology of H2S homeostasis and discuss H2S-based signaling via persulfidation and thionitrous acid.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by extremely elevated levels of plasma total homocysteine. The vast majority of CBS-deficient patients have missense mutations located in the CBS gene that result in the production of either misfolded or unstable protein. Here, we examine the effect of proteasome inhibitors on mutant CBS function using two different mouse models of CBS deficiency. These mice lack mouse CBS and express a missense mutant human CBS enzyme (either p.I278T or p.S466L) that has less than 5% of normal liver CBS activity, resulting in a 10-30-fold elevation in plasma homocysteine levels. We show that treatment of these mice with two different proteasome inhibitors can induce liver Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp27, increase levels of active CBS, and lower plasma homocysteine levels to within the normal range. However, response rates varied, with 100% (8/8) of the p.S466L animals showing correction, but only 38% (10/26) of the p.I278T animals. In total, our data show that treatment with proteostasis modulators can restore significant enzymatic activity to mutant misfolded CBS enzymes and suggests that they may be useful in treating certain types of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.

SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as a physiological mediator with a variety of functions. It regulates synaptic transmission, vascular tone, inflammation, transcription, and angiogenesis; protects cells from oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion injury; and promotes healing of ulcers.RECENT ADVANCES: In addition to cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase along with cysteine aminotransferase was recently demonstrated to produce H2S. Even in bacteria, H2S produced by these enzymes functions as a defense against antibiotics, suggesting that the cytoprotective effect of H2S is a universal defense mechanism in organisms from bacteria to mammals.CRITICAL ISSUES: The functional form of H2S-undissociated H2S gas, dissociated HS ion, or some other form of sulfur-has not been identified.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The regulation of H2S production by three enzymes may lead to the identification of the physiological signals that are required to release H2S. The identification of the physiological functions of other forms of sulfur may also help understand the biological significance of H2S.

Elevated levels of homocysteine produce detrimental effects in humans but its role in preterm birth is not known. Here we used a mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia to examine the relevance of homocysteine to preterm birth. The mouse carries a heterozygous deletion of cystathionine ß-synthase (Cbs(+/-)). Gestational period was monitored in wild type and Cbs(+/-) female mice. Mouse uterine and placental tissues, human primary trophoblast cells, and human myometrial and placental cell lines were used to determine the influence of homocysteine on expression of specific genes in vitro. The activity of BKCa channel in the myometrial cell line was monitored using the patch-clamp technique. We found that hyperhomocysteinemia had detrimental effects on pregnancy and induced preterm birth in mice. Homocysteine increased the expression of oxytocin receptor and Cox-2 as well as PGE2 production in uterus and placenta, and initiated premature uterine contraction. A Cox-2 inhibitor reversed these effects. Gpr109a, a receptor for niacin, induced Cox-2 in uterus. Homocysteine upregulated GPR109A and suppressed BKCa channel activity in human myometrial cells. Deletion of Gpr109a in Cbs(+/-) mice reversed premature birth. We conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia causes preterm birth in mice through upregulation of the Gpr109a/Cox-2/PGE2 axis and that pharmacological blockade of Gpr109a may have potential in prevention of preterm birth.

The AMPK/SNF1/SnRK1 protein kinases are a family of ancient and highly conserved eukaryotic energy sensors that function as heterotrimeric complexes. These typically comprise catalytic a subunits and regulatory ß and <U+03B3> subunits, the latter function as the energy-sensing modules of animal AMPK through adenosine nucleotide binding. The ability to monitor accurately and adapt to changing environmental conditions and energy supply is essential for optimal plant growth and survival, but mechanistic insight in the plant SnRK1 function is still limited. In addition to a family of <U+03B3>-like proteins, plants also encode a hybrid ß<U+03B3> protein that combines the Four-Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-domain (FCD) structure in <U+03B3> subunits with a glycogen-binding domain (GBD), typically found in ß subunits. We used integrated functional analyses by ectopic SnRK1 complex reconstitution, yeast mutant complementation, in-depth phylogenetic reconstruction, and a seedling starvation assay to show that only the hybrid KINß<U+03B3> protein that recruited the GBD around the emergence of the green chloroplast-containing plants, acts as the canonical <U+03B3> subunit required for heterotrimeric complex formation. Mutagenesis and truncation analysis further show that complex interaction in plant cells and <U+03B3> subunit function in yeast depend on both a highly conserved FCD and a pre-CBS domain, but not the GBD. In addition to novel insight into canonical AMPK/SNF/SnRK1 <U+03B3> subunit function, regulation and evolution, we provide a new classification of plant FCD genes as a convenient and reliable tool to predict regulatory partners for the SnRK1 energy sensor and novel FCD gene functions.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), long viewed as a toxic gas and environmental hazard, is emerging as a biological mediator with remarkable physiological and pathophysiological relevance. H2S is now viewed as the third main gasotransmitter in the mammalian body. Its pharmacological characteristic possesses similarities to the other two gasotransmitters - nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Many of the biological effects of H2S follow a bell-shaped concentration-response; at low concentration or at lower release rates it has beneficial and cytoprotective effects, while at higher concentrations or fast release rates toxicity becomes apparent. Cellular bioenergetics is a prime example for this bell-shaped dose-response, where H2S, at lower concentrations/rates serves as an inorganic substrate and electron donor for mitochondrial ATP generation, while at high concentration it inhibits mitochondrial respiration by blocking the Complex IV in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The current review is aimed to focus on the following aspects of H2S biology: 1) a general overview of the general pharmacological characteristics of H2S, 2) a summary of the key H2S-mediated signal transduction pathways, 3) an overview of role of H2S in regulation of cellular bioenergetics, 4) key aspects of H2S physiology in C. elegans (a model system) and, finally 5) the therapeutic potential of H2S donating molecules in various disease states.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with aortic aneurysm, however, the mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesize that the expression level of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, oxidative stress, and enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism pathway in aortic aneurysm and hyperhomocysteinemia are differentially regulated by DNA methylation. We studied the mRNA levels of MTHFR, SAHH, MMP-1, -9, TIMP-1, -4, peroxiredoxin, NOX-2, -3 (NAPDH oxidase subunits), collagen and elastin in normal and aortic aneurysm tissues from humans and aorta tissue from HHcy (Cystathionine beta synthase heterozygote knockout, CBS+/-) mice treated with high methionine diet. The total RNA was extracted using Trizol method and RT-PCR was performed. Protein expression of MTHFR, H3K9 (trimethyl) and TIMP4 were studied in mice using immunohistochemistry. MTHFR and TIMP4 expression was seen to be increasing in both human aneurysm samples as well as HHcy CBS+/- mice. There was increased expression of MMP9, peroxiredoxin and decreased expression of MMP1, Collagen I and IV was noted in thoracic aortic aneurysm samples. Increased Collagen IV and decreased Collagen I levels were seen in CBS +/- HHcy mice compared to their wild type controls. Since DNA methylation regulates gene expression of enzymes in Hcy metabolism pathway, we also measured the mRNA levels of DNMTs, MBD2 and H3K9. The results suggest an increase in the levels of DNMT1, 3a, MBD2 and H3K9 in CBS +/- aorta compared to their wild type controls. Our findings suggest a possible role of methylation in regulation of expression of genes involved in matrix remodeling and homocysteine metabolism.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an important pathophysiological process in the development of many diseases. However, the mechanism responsible for the development of PH remains unknown. The objective of the study was to explore the possible impact of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on the endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) pathway in rats with PH induced by high pulmonary blood flow. Compared with sham group, the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) in the shunt group was significantly increased, along with the increased percentage of muscularized arteries and partially muscularized arteries of small pulmonary arteries. Compared with the shunt group, SPAP in the shunt+SO2 group was significantly decreased, and the percentage of muscularized pulmonary arteries was also decreased. Additionally, rats that developed PH had significantly lower levels of SO2 concentration, aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) activity, protein and mRNA expressions of AAT2 in pulmonary tissues. Administration of an SO2 donor could alleviate the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and decrease the muscularization of pulmonary arteries. At the same time, it increased the H2S production, protein expression of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), mRNA expression of CSE, mercaptopyruvate transsulphurase (MPST) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) in the pulmonary tissue of the rats. The results suggested that endogenous SO2/AAT2 pathway and the endogenous H2S production were downregulated in rats with PH induced by high pulmonary blood flow. However, SO2 could reduce pulmonary arterial pressure and improve the pulmonary vascular pathological changes in association with upregulating endogenous H2S pathway.

Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) represents a potential antimicrobial drug target. The crystal structure of recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMPDH has been determined to a resolution of 2.25 Å. The structure is a homotetramer of subunits dominated by a (ß/a)8-barrel fold, consistent with other known structures of IMPDH. Also in common with previous work, the cystathionine ß-synthase domains, residues 92-204, are not present in the model owing to disorder. However, unlike the majority of available structures, clearly defined electron density exists for a loop that creates part of the active site. This loop, composed of residues 297-315, links a8 and ß9 and carries the catalytic Cys304. P. aeruginosa IMPDH shares a high level of sequence identity with bacterial and protozoan homologues, with residues involved in binding substrate and the NAD+ cofactor being conserved. Specific differences that have been proven to contribute to selectivity against the human enzyme in a study of Cryptosporidium parvum IMPDH are also conserved, highlighting the potential value of IMPDH as a drug target.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), a pathological condition characterized by an increase in plasma concentration of total homocysteine (Hcy), is recognized as a risk factor for several diseases. The transsulfuration pathway is the main metabolic fate of Hcy utilization, which requires the activity of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Our results showed the development of HHcy induced by psychological stress was mainly derived from a reduction of CBS activity in the liver, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in its mRNA level. It suggested that the hepatic CBS enzyme regulated by stress at the level of transcription would have a profound effect on circulating Hcy levels. The expression of Sp3, a negative factor for cbs transcription, obviously increased in hepatocytes nuclei of stressed rats, but Sp1 was not altered. It indicated that Sp3 was the key point of variations in cbs transcription caused by stress. Meanwhile, we detected that augmented plasma Hcy concentrations correlated with glucocordicoids (GCs) over-secretion in response to stress, and CBS mRNA levels were markedly lowered in GCs-treated rat hepatocytes. Further results found that glucocorticoids receptor (GR) expression in hepatocyte nuclei of stress rats and GR nuclear translocation ratio was increased, and the same results were proved by experiments in vitro, i.e., GR nuclear translocation and Sp3 expression was remarkably increased in GCs-treated hepatocytes. Moreover, results from ChIP suggested GCs enhanced the binding of GR to the regulatory region of the Sp3 promoter. These results indicated that GCs inhibit CBS transcription by up-regulating Sp3 in psychological stress-induced HHcy.



#### Thrombospondin-1 is a CD47-dependent endogenous inhibitor of hydrogen sulfide signaling in T cell activation.

Thrombospondin-1 is a potent suppressor of T cell activation via its receptor CD47. However, the precise mechanism for this inhibition remains unclear. Because H2S is an endogenous potentiator of T cell activation and is necessary for full T cell activation, we hypothesized that thrombospondin-1 signaling through CD47 inhibits T cell activation by antagonizing H2S signaling. Primary T cells from thrombospondin-1 null mice were more sensitive to H2S-dependent activation assessed by proliferation and induction of interleukin-2 and CD69 mRNAs. Exogenous thrombospondin-1 inhibited H2S responses in wild type and thrombospondin-1 null T cells but enhanced the same responses in CD47 null T cells. Fibronectin, which shares integrin and glycosaminoglycan binding properties with thrombospondin-1 but not CD47 binding, did not inhibit H2S signaling. A CD47-binding peptide derived from thrombospondin-1 inhibited H2S-induced activation, whereas two other functional sequences from thrombospondin-1 enhanced H2S signaling. Therefore, engaging CD47 is necessary and sufficient for thrombospondin-1 to inhibit H2S-dependent T cell activation. H2S stimulated T cell activation by potentiating MEK-dependent ERK phosphorylation, and thrombospondin-1 inhibited this signaling in a CD47-dependent manner. Thrombospondin-1 also limited activation-dependent T cell expression of the H2S biosynthetic enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, thereby limiting the autocrine role of H2S in T cell activation. Thus, thrombospondin-1 signaling through CD47 is the first identified endogenous inhibitor of H2S signaling and constitutes a novel mechanism that negatively regulates T cell activation.

Streptomycetes, soil-dwelling mycelial bacteria, can colonise surface of organic soil debris and soil particles. We analysed the effects of two different inert surfaces, glass and zirconia/silica, on the growth and antibiotic production in Streptomyces granaticolor. The surfaces used were in the form of microbeads and were surrounded by liquid growth media. Following the production of the antibiotic granaticin, more biomass was formed as well as a greater amount of antibiotic per milligram of protein on the glass beads than on the zirconia/silica beads. Comparison of young mycelium (6 h) proteomes, obtained from the cultures attached to the glass and zirconia/silica beads, revealed three proteins with altered expression levels (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, amidophosphoribosyltransferase and cystathionine beta-synthase) and one unique protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) that was present only in cells grown on glass beads. All of the identified proteins function primarily as cytoplasmic enzymes involved in different parts of metabolism; however, in several microorganisms, they are exposed on the cell surface and have been shown to be involved in adhesion or biofilm formation.

BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle has recently been recognized as an endocrine organ that can express, synthesize and secrete a variety of bioactive molecules which exert significant regulatory effects. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is endogenously produced in mammalian tissues and participates in a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes. We aimed to verify whether H2S could be endogenously generated and released by rat skeletal muscle, and determine the biological effects of H2S in rat skeletal muscle.METHODS: The study was divided into two parts: detection of endogenous H2S generation and release in rat skeletal muscle and determination of antioxidative activity of skeletal muscle-derived H2S. H2S content and production in tissues were detected by sensitive sulfur electrode method. The expressions of H2S producing enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting and their tissue distributions were observed by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis. Rat skeletal muscular ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury model was created and evaluated by histological analysis under microscope. The malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, hydrogen peroxide levels, superoxide anion and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were detected using spectrophotometer.RESULTS: H2S could be endogenously generated and released by skeletal muscle of Sprague-Dawley rats (H2S content: (2.06 ± 0.43) nmol/mg; H2S production: (0.17 ± 0.06) nmol×min(-1)×mg(-1)). Gene and protein expressions of the three H2S producing enzymes were detected in skeletal muscle, as well as the liver and kidney. Endogenous H2S content and production were decreased in skeletal muscles of rats with I-R skeletal muscle injury (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, H2S significantly protected rat skeletal muscle against I-R injury and resulted in decreased MDA content, reduced hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion levels, but increased SOD activity and protein expression in skeletal muscles (all P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: H2S generation pathway exists in rat skeletal muscle and it acts as an antioxidant in skeletal muscle.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a signalling molecule that belongs to the gasotransmitter family. Two major sources for endogenous enzymatic production of H2S are cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE). In the present study, we examined the selectivity of commonly used pharmacological inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis towards CSE and CBS.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To address this question, human CSE or CBS enzymes were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with GSH-S-transferase. After purification, the activity of the recombinant enzymes was tested using the methylene blue method.KEY RESULTS: ß-Cyanoalanine (BCA) was more potent in inhibiting CSE than propargylglycine (PAG) (IC50 14 ± 0.2 µM vs. 40 ± 8 µM respectively). Similar to PAG, L-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) only inhibited CSE, but did so at much lower concentrations. On the other hand, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a frequently used CBS inhibitor, was more potent in inhibiting CSE compared with BCA and PAG (IC50 1.1 ± 0.1<U+2009>µM); the IC50 for AOAA for inhibiting CBS was 8.5 ± 0.7 µM. In line with our biochemical observations, relaxation to L-cysteine was blocked by AOAA in aortic rings that lacked CBS expression. Trifluoroalanine and hydroxylamine, two compounds that have also been used to block H2S biosynthesis, blocked the activity of CBS and CSE. Trifluoroalanine had a fourfold lower IC50 for CBS versus CSE, while hydroxylamine was 60-fold more selective against CSE.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In conclusion, although PAG, AVG and BCA exhibit selectivity in inhibiting CSE versus CBS, no selective pharmacological CBS inhibitor is currently available.

OBJECTIVE: Congenital Heart Defects (CHD) may be related to nutritional deficiencies affecting the methylation cycle. We aimed to study the metabolic markers of the betaine homocysteine methyl transferase (BHMT) pathway in children with CHD and their mothers compared to children without CHD and their mothers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with CHD (n=105, age &lt; 3 years) and mothers of 80 of the affected children were studied. The controls were non-CHDs children of comparable age as the CHD group (n=52) and their mothers (n=50). We measured serum or plasma concentrations of the metabolites of the methylation cycle homocysteine (HCY), methylmalonic acid (MMA), cystathionine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), betaine, choline, and dimethylglycine (DMG).RESULTS: Children with CHD had higher plasma SAM (131 vs. 100 nmol/L) and DMG (8.7 vs. 6.0 µmol/L) and lower betaine/DMG ratio (7.5 vs. 10.2) compared to the controls. Mothers of CHD children showed also higher DMG (6.1 vs. 4.1 µmol/L) and lower betaine/DMG ratio compared with the mothers of the controls. Higher SAM levels were related to higher cystathionine, MMA, betaine, choline, and DMG. MMA elevation in the patients was related to higher HCY, SAM, betaine and DMG.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated DMG in CHD children and their mothers compared to the controls can indicate upregulation of the BHMT pathway in this disease group. Nutritional factors are related to metabolic imbalance during pregnancy that may be related to worse birth outcome.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been recognized as an important physiologically relevant gasotransmitter. Produced by the enzymes involved in the transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), H2S has been implicated to control biological activity in virtually every organ system. In recent years it is being recognized that many commonly used H2S assays do not measure free H2S specifically and may be prone to artifacts. This has led to large variations in the reported H2S biological concentrations. In order to accurately study H2S's functions in biological systems accurate assays which measure free H2S specifically are required. In this work we present a simple microplate-based colorimetric assay for H2S gas. The underside of a 96-well microplate cover was coated with Nafion polymer doped with Ag(+) ions. H2S is a highly volatile gas, and as it is volatilized in the microplate well it reacts with Ag(+) to produce Ag2S nanoparticles, which have a strong absorbance in the low-UV range. By monitoring the absorbance change from formation of Ag2S nanoparticles, H2S production can be monitored in real time. The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.61 nmol (8.70 µM) and a liner range up to 30 nmol (100 µM). Using the assay, the KM and Vmax of recombinant CSE enzyme were determined to be 11.13 ± 0.57 mM and 0.45 ± 0.01 nmol min(-1), respectively. H2S production from mouse liver homogenate under aerobic conditions in the presence of cysteine was measured and determined to be 4.89 ± 0.19 nmol min(-1) mL(-1) homogenate. The assay is simple, low cost, and specific to free H2S gas.

Obesity is an underlying risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Increased hepatic lipid accumulation is a hallmark in the progression of NAFLD and impairments in liver phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism may be central to the pathogenesis. Hepatic PC biosynthesis, which is linked to the one-carbon (C1) metabolism by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, is known to be important for hepatic lipid export by VLDL particles. Here, we assessed the influence of a high-fat (HF) diet and NAFLD status in mice on hepatic methyl-group expenditure and C1-metabolism by analyzing changes in gene expression, protein levels, metabolite concentrations, and nuclear epigenetic processes. In livers from HF diet induced obese mice a significant downregulation of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and an increased betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) expression were observed. Experiments in vitro, using hepatoma cells stimulated with peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa) agonist WY14,643, revealed a significantly reduced Cbs mRNA expression. Moreover, metabolite measurements identified decreased hepatic cystathionine and L-a-amino-n-butyrate concentrations as part of the transsulfuration pathway and reduced hepatic betaine concentrations, but no metabolite changes in the methionine cycle in HF diet fed mice compared to controls. Furthermore, we detected diminished hepatic gene expression of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3b but no effects on hepatic global genomic DNA methylation or hepatic DNA methylation in the Cbs promoter region upon HF diet. Our data suggest that HF diet induces a PPARa-mediated downregulation of key enzymes in the hepatic transsulfuration pathway and upregulates BHMT expression in mice to accommodate to enhanced dietary fat processing while preserving the essential amino acid methionine.

Cystathionine <U+03B3>-synthase (CGS) and cystathionine ß-lyase (CBL) share a common structure and several active-site residues, but catalyze distinct side-chain rearrangements in the two-step transsulfuration pathway that converts cysteine to homocysteine, the precursor of methionine. A series of 12 chimeric variants of Escherichia coli CGS (eCGS) and CBL (eCBL) was constructed to probe the roles of two structurally distinct, ~25-residue segments situated in proximity to the amino and carboxy termini and located at the entrance of the active-site. In vivo complementation of methionine-auxotrophic E. coli strains, lacking the genes encoding eCGS and eCBL, demonstrated that exchange of the targeted regions impairs the activity of the resulting enzymes, but does not produce a corresponding interchange of reaction specificity. In keeping with the in vivo results, the catalytic efficiency of the native reactions is reduced by at least 95-fold, and a,ß versus a,<U+03B3>-elimination specificity is not modified. The midpoint of thermal denaturation monitored by circular dichroism, ranges between 59 and 80°C, compared to 66°C for the two wild-type enzymes, indicating that the chimeric enzymes adopt a stable folded structure and that the observed reductions in catalytic efficiency are due to reorganization of the active site. Alanine-substitution variants of residues S32 and S33, as well as K42 of eCBL, situated in proximity to and within, respectively, the targeted amino-terminal region were also investigated to explore their role as determinants of reaction specificity via positioning of key active-site residues. The catalytic efficiency of the S32A, S33A and the K42A site-directed variants of eCBL is reduced by less than 10-fold, demonstrating that, while these residues may participate in positioning S339, which tethers the catalytic base, their role is minor.

Abstract Purpose: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme in the transsulfuration metabolic pathway, converts homocysteine to cystathionine, which is converted to cysteine required for the synthesis of major retinal antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Enzyme activity assays suggest that CBS is present in human and pig retina, however recent studies reported that CBS is not expressed in mouse retina. We found this species difference puzzling. Given the plethora of studies using mouse retina as a model system, coupled with the importance of GSH in retina, we investigated CBS expression in mouse retina at the molecular and cell biological level.</AbstractText>: Abstract Purpose: Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme in the transsulfuration metabolic pathway, converts homocysteine to cystathionine, which is converted to cysteine required for the synthesis of major retinal antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Enzyme activity assays suggest that CBS is present in human and pig retina, however recent studies reported that CBS is not expressed in mouse retina. We found this species difference puzzling. Given the plethora of studies using mouse retina as a model system, coupled with the importance of GSH in retina, we investigated CBS expression in mouse retina at the molecular and cell biological level.METHODS: Wildtype (WT) mice or mice lacking the gene encoding CBS (cbs(-)(/)(-)) were used in these studies. RNA and protein were isolated from retinas and liver (positive control) for the analysis of cbs gene expression by RT-PCR and CBS protein expression by Western blotting, respectively. CBS was analyzed by immunofluorescence in retinal cryosections and primary retinal cells (ganglion, Müller, retinal pigment epithelial). CBS enzyme activity was measured in primary Müller cells.RESULTS: RT-PCR revealed robust cbs expression in WT liver, brain and retina. Western blotting detected CBS in retina, brain and liver of WT mice, but not in cbs(-)(/)(-) mice liver. In immunohistochemical studies, CBS was present abundantly in the ganglion cell layer of retina; it was detected also in primary isolations of Müller, RPE and ganglion cells. CBS activity was detected in Müller cells by fluorescent detection of H2S.CONCLUSIONS: We have compelling molecular evidence that CBS is expressed in mouse retina at the gene and protein level. Our immunofluorescence data suggest that it is present in several retinal cell types and the data from the enzyme activity assay suggest activity in Müller cells. These findings set the stage to investigate the role of CBS and the transsulfuration pathway in the generation of GSH in mouse retina.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), generated through various endogenous enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways, is emerging as a regulator of physiological and pathological events throughout the body. Bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract also produce significant amounts of H2S that regulates microflora growth and virulence responses. However, the impact of the microbiota on host global H2S bioavailability and metabolism remains unknown. To address this question, we examined H2S bioavailability in its various forms (free, acid labile, or bound sulfane sulfur), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) activity, and cysteine levels in tissues from germ-free versus conventionally housed mice. Free H2S levels were significantly reduced in plasma and gastrointestinal tissues of germ-free mice. Bound sulfane sulfur levels were decreased by 50-80% in germ-free mouse plasma and adipose and lung tissues. Tissue CSE activity was significantly reduced in many organs from germ-free mice, whereas tissue cysteine levels were significantly elevated compared to conventional mice. These data reveal that the microbiota profoundly regulates systemic bioavailability and metabolism of H2S.

The pathogenesis of pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is poorly understood, and treatment remains difficult. We have previously reported that colon-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were hyperactive in a rat model of IBS induced by neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI). This study was designed to examine plasticity of voltage-gated Na(+) channel activities and roles for the endogenous hydrogen sulfide-producing enzyme cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) in chronic visceral hyperalgesia. Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores were recorded in response to graded colorectal distention in adult male rats as a measure of visceral hypersensitivity. Colon-specific DRG neurons were labeled with 1,1'-dioleyl-3,3,3',3-tetramethylindocarbocyanine methanesulfonate and acutely dissociated for measuring Na(+) channel currents. Western blot analysis was employed to detect changes in expressions of voltage-gated Na(+) (Na(V)) channel subtype 1.7, Na(V)1.8, and CBS. NCI significantly increased AWR scores when compared with age-matched controls. NCI also led to an ~2.5-fold increase in Na(+) current density in colon-specific DRG neurons. Furthermore, NCI dramatically enhanced expression of Na(V)1.7, Na(V)1.8, and CBS in colon-related DRGs. CBS was colocalized with Na(V)1.7 or -1.8 in colon-specific DRG neurons. Administration of O-(carboxymethyl)hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (AOAA), an inhibitor for CBS, remarkably suppressed Na(+) current density and reduced expression of Na(V)1.7 and Na(V)1.8. More importantly, intraperitoneal or intrathecal application of AOAA attenuated AWR scores in NCI rats in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that NCI enhances Na(+) channel activity of colon DRG neurons, which is most likely mediated by upregulation of CBS expression, thus identifying a potential target for treatment for chronic visceral pain in patients with IBS.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter with physiologic functions similar to nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Exogenous treatment with H2S can induce a reversible hypometabolic state, which can protect organs from ischemia/reperfusion injury, but whether cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), which produces endogenous H2S, has similar protective effects is unknown. Here, human renal tissue revealed abundant expression of CSE, localized to glomeruli and the tubulointerstitium. Compared with wild-type mice, CSE knockout mice had markedly reduced renal production of H2S, and CSE deficiency associated with increased damage and mortality after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Treatment with exogenous H2S rescued CSE knockout mice from the injury and mortality associated with renal ischemia. In addition, overexpression of CSE in vitro reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species produced during stress. Last, the level of renal CSE mRNA at the time of organ procurement positively associated with GFR 14 days after transplantation. In summary, these results suggest that CSE protects against renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, likely by modulating oxidative stress through the production of H2S.

Dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism-related metabolic processes is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is well established that genetic and gender-specific variations in one-carbon metabolism contribute to the vulnerability to NAFLD in humans. To examine the role of one-carbon metabolism dysregulation in the pathogenesis and individual susceptibility to NAFLD, we used a &quot;population-based&quot; mouse model where male mice from 7 inbred were fed a choline- and folate-deficient (CFD) diet for 12 wk. Strain-dependent down-regulation of several key one-carbon metabolism genes, including methionine adenosyltransferase 1a (Mat1a), cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr), adenosyl-homocysteinase (Ahcy), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (Mthfd1), was observed. These changes were strongly associated with interstrain variability in liver injury (steatosis, necrosis, inflammation, and activation of fibrogenesis) and hyperhomocysteinemia. Mechanistically, the decreased expression of Mat1a, Ahcy, and Mthfd1 was linked to a reduced level and promoter binding of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ß (CEBPß), which directly regulates their transcription. The strain specificity of diet-induced dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism suggests that interstrain variation in the regulation of one-carbon metabolism may contribute to the differential vulnerability to NFLD and that correcting the imbalance may be considered as preventive and treatment strategies for NAFLD.

Methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency (MAT I/III deficiency) is an inborn error of metabolism resulting in isolated hypermethioninemia, and usually inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, although a dominant form has been reported in several families.During the last 6 years, approximately 520,000 newborns were screened in the Portuguese Newborn Screening Laboratory by MS/MS, and 21 cases of persistent hypermethioninemia were found. One case was confirmed to be a deficiency of cystathionine ß-synthase and 20 cases were confirmed by MAT1A gene analysis to have an elevation of methionine due to MAT I/III deficiency, which indicates an incidence for this condition of 1/26,000. Twelve of the MAT I/III deficient newborns, belonging to 11 families, were identified in the northern region of Portugal and sent to the same treatment center, where they are under follow-up. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics of individuals from these 11 families are presented. Plasma methionine and homocysteine concentrations were found to be moderately increased in all newborns, and molecular analysis revealed that they all were heterozygous for R264H mutation. Normal growth, development, and neurological examination were observed in all cases, and cerebral MRI performed in six cases revealed myelination abnormalities in one case. Plasma methionine concentration for all 12 cases was always below 300 µM, and they are all on a normal diet for their age.

PURPOSE: To explore the relationship between genetic polymorphisms in reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC-1), cystathionine b-synthase (CBS), two key genes in folate metabolism, and the risk of Down syndrome in China.METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral lymphocytes of 104 mothers born children with Down syndrome and 184 age-matched control mothers. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction-fragment length polymorphism were used to examine the polymorphisms of RFC-1 A80G, CBS T833C and the relationship between these genotypes and the risk of Down syndrome was analyzed.RESULTS: We found that there were significant differences between RFC-1 G80G, CBS C833C polymorphisms among mothers of children with Down syndrome than among control mothers, with odds ratio of 1.51 (95 % CI 1.05-2.18), 1.53 (95 % CI 1.07-2.18) respectively. The combined presence of RFC1 mutant alleles and the CBS homozygous mutant allele (15/104) was associated with a 4.81-fold increased risk of having a child with Down syndrome (95 % CI 1.82-12.68, P = 0.0007).CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that RFC-1 and CBS gene mutation alleles are related to Down syndrome, and women with mutation RFC-1 G80G, CBS C833C OR combined with RFC-1 A80G and CBS 833TT genotype increase the risk of Down syndrome in China.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, characterized by high plasma homocysteine levels, is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The increased synthesis of homocysteine, a product of methionine metabolism involving B vitamins, and its slower intracellular utilization cause increased flux into the blood. Plasma homocysteine level is an important reflection of hepatic methionine metabolism and the rate of processes modified by B vitamins as well as different enzyme activity. Lowering homocysteine might offer therapeutic benefits. However, approximately 50% of hyperhomocysteinemic patients due to cystathionine-beta-synthase deficiency are biochemically responsive to pharmacological doses of B vitamins. Therefore, effective treatments to reduce homocysteine levels are needed, and gene therapy could provide a novel approach. We recently showed that hepatic expression of DYRK1A, a serine/threonine kinase, is negatively correlated with plasma homocysteine levels in cystathionine-beta-synthase deficient mice, a mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Therefore, Dyrk1a is a good candidate for gene therapy to normalize homocysteine levels. We then used an adenoviral construct designed to restrict expression of DYRK1A to hepatocytes, and found decreased plasma homocysteine levels after hepatocyte-specific Dyrk1a gene transfer in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. The elevation of pyridoxal phosphate was consistent with the increase in cystathionine-beta-synthase activity. Commensurate with the decreased plasma homocysteine levels, targeted hepatic expression of DYRK1A resulted in elevated plasma paraoxonase-1 activity and apolipoprotein A-I levels, and rescued the Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways in aorta of mice, which can prevent homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction. These results demonstrate that hepatocyte-restricted Dyrk1a gene transfer can offer a useful therapeutic targets for the development of new selective homocysteine lowering therapy.

Consistent with data in animal systems, experimental evidence highlights sulfide as a signaling molecule of equal importance to NO and H2O2 in plant systems. In mammals, two cytosolic enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), have been shown to be responsible for the endogenous production of sulfide. L-cysteine desulfhydrase 1 (DES1) has been recently established as the only enzyme that is involved in the generation of hydrogen sulfide in plant cytosol. Although plants have an available source of sulfide within chloroplasts, the basic stromal pH prevents sulfide release into the cytosol. Therefore, DES1 is essential for the production of sulfide for signaling purposes.

BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) results from the presence and expression of three copies of the genes located on chromosome 21. Studies have shown that, in addition to overexpression of the Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) gene, polymorphisms in genes involved in folate/homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism may also influence the concentrations of metabolites of this pathway.AIM: Investigate the association between Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 19-base pair (bp) deletion and Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) C1420T polymorphisms and serum folate and plasma Hcy and methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations in 85 individuals with DS.METHODS: Molecular analysis of the DHFR 19-bp deletion and SHMT C1420T polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by difference in the size of fragments and real-time PCR allelic discrimination, respectively. Serum folate was quantified by chemiluminescence and plasma Hcy and MMA by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.RESULTS: Individuals with DHFR DD/SHMT TT genotypes presented increased folate concentrations (p=0.004) and the DHFR II/SHMT TT genotypes were associated with increased MMA concentrations (p=0.008). In addition, the MMA concentrations were negatively associated with age (p=0.04).CONCLUSION: There is an association between DHFR DD/SHMT TT and DHFR II/SHMT TT combined genotypes and folate and MMA concentrations in individuals with DS.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gaseotransmitter/modulator, is becoming appreciated that it may be involved in a wide variety of processes including inflammation and nociception. However, the role and mechanism for H2S in nociceptive processing in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neuron remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate distribution of endogenous H2S synthesizing enzyme cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS) expression and role of H2S on excitability and voltage-gated potassium channels of TG neurons.METHODS: Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to determine whether CBS was co-expressed in Kv1.1 or Kv1.4-positive TG neurons. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were employed on acutely isolated TG neurons from adult male Sprague Dawley rats (6-8<U+2009>week old). von Frey filaments were used to examine the pain behavioral responses in rats following injection of sodium hydrosulfide.RESULTS: In rat TG, 77.3±6.6% neurons were immunoreactive for CBS, 85.1±3.8% for Kv1.1 and 97.8±1.1% for Kv1.4. Double staining showed that all CBS labeled cells were Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 positive, but only 92.2±6.1% of Kv1.1 and 78.2±9.9% of Kv1.4 positive cells contained CBS. Application of H2S donor NaHS (250<U+2009>µM) led to a significant depolarization of resting membrane potential recorded from TG neurons. NaHS application also resulted in a dramatic reduction in rheobase, hyperpolarization of action potential threshold, and a significant increase in the number of action potentials evoked at 2X and 3X rheobase stimulation. Under voltage-clamp conditions, TG neurons exhibited transient A-type (IA) and sustained outward rectifier K+ currents (IK). Application of NaHS did suppress IK density while did not change IA density of TG neurons (n=6). Furthermore, NaHS, a donor of hydrogen sulfide, produced a significant reduction in escape threshold in a dose dependent manner.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that endogenous H2S generating enzyme CBS was co-localized well with Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 in TG neurons and that H2S produces the mechanic pain and increases neuronal excitability, which might be largely mediated by suppressing IK density, thus identifying for the first time a specific molecular mechanism underlying pain and sensitization in TG.

Increased vascular impedance in the fetoplacental circulation is associated with fetal hypoxia and growth restriction. We sought to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating vasomotor tone in the fetoplacental vasculature. H2S is produced endogenously by catalytic activity of cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). Immunohistochemical analysis localized CSE to smooth muscle cells encircling arteries in stem villi. Immunoreactivity was reduced in placentas from pregnancies with severe early-onset growth-restriction and preeclampsia displaying abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms compared with preeclamptic placentas with normal waveforms and controls. These findings were confirmed at the protein and mRNA levels. MicroRNA-21, which negatively regulates CSE expression, was increased in placentas with abnormal Doppler waveforms. Exposure of villus explants to hypoxia-reoxygenation significantly reduced CSE protein and mRNA and increased microRNA-21 expression. No changes were observed in cystathionine ß-synthase expression, immunolocalized principally to the trophoblast, in pathologic placentas or in vitro. Finally, perfusion of normal placentas with an H2S donor, after preconstriction with a thromboxane mimetic, resulted in dose-dependent vasorelaxation. Glibenclamide and N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester partially blocked the effect, indicating that H2S acts through ATP-sensitive K(+) channels and nitric oxide synthesis. These results demonstrate that H2S is a powerful vasodilator of the placental vasculature and that expression of CSE is reduced in placentas associated with increased vascular resistance.

BACKGROUND: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy, psychiatric diseases and pain disorders. Several of these drugs influence blood levels of folate and vitamin B12 and, consequently, homocysteine. This may be relevant for AED effects and side effects. However, not only folate and vitamin B12, but also genetic variants modify homocysteine metabolism. Here, we aimed to determine whether there is a pharmacogenetic interaction between folate, vitamin B12 and genetic variants and homocysteine plasma level in AED-treated patients.METHODS: In this mono-center study, we measured homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 plasma levels in a population of 498 AED-treated adult patients with epilepsy. In addition, we analyzed the genotypes of seven common genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.677C&gt;T and c.1298A&gt;C, methionine synthase (MTR) c.2756A&gt;G, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) c.594+59del19bp, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) c.844_855ins68, transcobalamin 2 (TC2) c.776C&gt;G and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) c.66G&gt;A.RESULTS: On multivariate logistic regression, folate and vitamin B12 levels, but none of the genetic variants, were predictive for homocysteine levels.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in AED-treated patients, folate and vitamin B12 play important roles in the development of hyperhomocysteinemia, whereas genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism do not and thus do not contribute to the risk of developing hyperhomocysteinemia during AED treatment.

We have previously reported that bradykinin relaxes the fetal ductus arteriosus via endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) when other naturally occurring relaxants (prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide) are suppressed, but the identity of the agent could not be ascertained. Here, we have examined in the mouse whether hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a relaxant of the ductus and, if so, whether it may also function as an EDHF. We found in the vessel transcripts for the H2S synthetic enzymes, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), and the presence of these enzymes was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. CSE and CBS were distributed across the vessel wall with the former prevailing in the intimal layer. Both enzymes occurred within the endoplasmic reticulum of endothelial and muscle cells, whereas only CSE was located also in the plasma membrane. The isolated ductus contracted to inhibitors of CSE (d,l-propargylglycine, PPG) and CBS (amino-oxyacetic acid), and PPG contraction was attenuated by removal of the endothelium. EDHF-mediated bradykinin relaxation was curtailed by both PPG and amino-oxyacetic acid, whereas the relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was not affected by either treatment. The H2S donor sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) was also a potent, concentration-dependent relaxant. We conclude that the ductus is endowed with a H2S system exerting a tonic relaxation. In addition, H2S, possibly via an overriding CSE source, qualifies as an EDHF. These findings introduce a novel vasoregulatory mechanism into the ductus, with implications for antenatal patency of the vessel and its transitional adjustments at birth.

Growing evidence has suggested that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) acts as a novel neuro-modulator and neuroprotective agent; however, it remains to be investigated whether H2S has a direct effect on neural stem cells (NSCs). We report here that NSCs expressed cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) and addition of exogenous H2S donor, L-cysteine, stimulated proliferation and increased the differentiation potential of NSCs to neurons and astroglia. Moreover, pre-treatment with aminooxyacetic acid, the inhibitor of CBS or knockdown of CBS in using siRNA, significantly attenuated the effects of L-cysteine on elevated H2S levels and the cell proliferation; it also effectively suppressed L-cysteine-induced neurogenesis and astrocytogenesis. Further analysis revealed that L-cysteine-induced proliferation was associated with phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and differentiation with altered expression of differentiation-related genes. Taken together, the present data suggest that L-cysteine can enhance proliferation and differentiation of NSCs via the CBS/H2S pathway, which may serve as a useful inference for elucidating its role in regulating the fate of NSCs in physiological and pathological settings.

BACKGROUND: Formaldehyde (FA) induces neurotoxicity by overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increasing studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous gastransmitter, protects nerve cells against oxidative stress by its antioxidant effect. It has been shown that overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the activity of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), the predominant H(2)S-generating enzyme in the central nervous system.OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that FA-caused neurotoxicity involves the deficiency of this endogenous protective antioxidant gas, which results from excessive generation of NO. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether FA disturbs H(2)S synthesis in PC12 cells, and whether this disturbance is associated with overproduction of NO.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We showed that exposure of PC12 cells to FA causes reduction of viability, inhibition of CBS expression, decrease of endogenous H(2)S production, and NO production. CBS silencing deteriorates FA-induced decreases in endogenous H(2)S generation, neurotoxicity, and intracellular ROS accumulation in PC12 cells; while ADMA, a specific inhibitor of NOS significantly attenuates FA-induced decreases in endogenous H(2)S generation, neurotoxicity, and intracellular ROS accumulation in PC12 cells.SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that FA induces neurotoxicity by inhibiting the generation of H(2)S through excess of NO and suggest that strategies to manipulate endogenous H(2)S could open a suitable novel therapeutic avenue for FA-induced neurotoxicity.

AIMS: To define the consequences of loss of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) on cysteine metabolism at the tissue level, we determined levels of relevant metabolites and enzymes and evidence of H2S/HS(-) (gaseous hydrogen sulfide and its conjugate base) toxicity in liver, pancreas, kidney, and lung of CDO(-/-) mice that were fed either a taurine-free or taurine-supplemented diet.RESULTS: CDO(-/-) mice had low tissue and serum taurine and hypotaurine levels and high tissue levels of cysteine, consistent with the loss of CDO. CDO(-/-) mice had elevated urinary excretion of thiosulfate, high tissue and serum cystathionine and lanthionine levels, and evidence of inhibition and destabilization of cytochrome c oxidase, which is consistent with excess production of H2S/HS(-). Accumulation of cystathionine and lanthionine appeared to result from cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-mediated cysteine desulfhydration. Very high levels of hypotaurine in pancreas of wild-type mice and very high levels of cystathionine and lanthionine in pancreas of CDO(-/-) mice were observed, suggesting a unique cysteine metabolism in the pancreas.INNOVATION: The CDO(-/-) mouse model provides new insights into tissue-specific cysteine metabolism, particularly the role of pancreas in metabolism of excess cysteine by CBS-catalyzed reactions, and will be a useful model for studying the effects of excess endogenous production of H2S/HS(-).CONCLUSION: The CDO(-/-) mouse clearly demonstrates that H2S/HS(-) production in tissues can exceed the capacity of the animal to oxidize sulfide to sulfate and demonstrates that pancreas and lung are more susceptible to toxicity from endogenous H2S/HS(-)production than are liver and kidney.

In eukaryotes, hydrogen sulphide acts as a signalling molecule and cytoprotectant. Hydrogen sulphide is known to be produced from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase coupled with cysteine aminotransferase. Here we report an additional biosynthetic pathway for the production of hydrogen sulphide from D-cysteine involving 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and D-amino acid oxidase. Unlike the L-cysteine pathway, this D-cysteine-dependent pathway operates predominantly in the cerebellum and the kidney. Our study reveals that administration of D-cysteine protects primary cultures of cerebellar neurons from oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide and attenuates ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the kidney more than L-cysteine. This study presents a novel pathway of hydrogen sulphide production and provides a new therapeutic approach to deliver hydrogen sulphide to specific tissues.

The distribution of two enzymes involved in H(2)S synthesis, cystationine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystationine <U+03B3>-liase (CSE), was studied in the walls of the internal carotid artery, order I-V branches of the middle cerebral artery basin, and intracerebral vessels of adult Wistar rats. Immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of CBS in the endothelium of small pial arteries (order IV-V branches) and intracerebral arterioles and in the capillary walls, neurons, and vascular nerves. As for CSE, in the internal carotid artery and large (order I-II) pial branches it was found mainly in the tunica media myocytes, in order III-IV vessels in myocytes and endothelium, and in smaller pial and intracerebral vessels in the endothelium. Along with enzyme-positive vessels, many pial and intracerebral arteries contained no these enzymes in the walls.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a lipid-soluble, endogenously produced gaseous messenger molecule collectively known as gasotransmitter. Over the last several decades, gasotransmitters have emerged as potent cytoprotective mediators in various models of tissue and cellular injury. In this study, we performed a weight-drop traumatic brain injury (TBI) model in adult mice and investigated changes of H2S and its possible role in the pathogenesis after TBI. Expression of Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) mRNA as H2S-producing enzymes in mouse brain was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). From the results of RT-PCR, it was found that the expression of CBS was down-regulated in mouse brain cortex and hippocampus after brain injury. Western blot analysis revealed that CBS was present in normal mouse brain cortex and the hippocampus. It gradually decreased, reached its lowest level and then increased. Hydrogen sulfide in the cortex and hippocampus exhibited dynamic changes after brain injury, in parallel with CBS mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, pretreatment with the H2S donor (NaHS) could protect the neuron against the injury induced by TBI. Noticeably, the H2S donor NaHS could reduce TBI-induced injury assessed with lesion volume. These data suggested that H2S may have a therapeutic potential against neuron damage.

Vitamin B6 functions as a coenzyme in &gt;140 enzymatic reactions involved in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, neurotransmitters, and lipids. It comprises a group of three related 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-pyrimidine derivatives: pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxamine (PM) and their phosphorylated derivatives [pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP)], In the folate metabolism pathway, PLP is a cofactor for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isozymes of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2 and SHMT1), the P-protein of the glycine cleavage system, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and <U+03B3>-cystathionase, and betaine hydroxymethyltransferase (BHMT), all of which contribute to homocysteine metabolism either through folate- mediated one-carbon metabolism or the transsulfuration pathway. Folate cofactors carry and chemically activate single carbons for the synthesis of purines, thymidylate and methionine. So the evidence indicates that vitamin B6 plays an important role in maintenance of the genome, epigenetic stability and homocysteine metabolism. This article focuses on studies of strand breaks, micronuclei, or chromosomal aberrations regarding protective effects of vitamin B6, and probes whether it is folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism or the transsulfuration pathway for vitamin B6 which plays critical roles in prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine and occupies a crucial regulatory position between the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of cysteine by transsulfuration. It was reported that CBS was a novel marker of both differentiation and proliferation for certain cell types, suggesting that CBS represents a survival-promoting protein. However, its expression and function in the central nervous system lesion are not well understood. To investigate changes of CBS after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its possible role, mice TBI model was established by controlled cortical impact system, and the expression and cellular localization of CBS after TBI was investigated in the present study. Western blot analysis revealed that CBS was present in normal mice brain cortex. It gradually decreased, reached a valley at the third day after TBI, and then restored to basal level. Importantly, more CBS was colocalized with neuron. In addition, Western blot detection showed that the third day postinjury was also the apoptosis peak indicated by the elevated expression of caspase-3. Importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that injury-induced expression of CBS was colabeled by Bcl-2 and had no co-localization with caspase-3. These data suggested that CBS may be implicated in the apoptosis of neuron and involved in the pathophysiology of brain after TBI.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is recognized as a physiologic mediator produced in a variety of tissues. It is produced by three enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). However, the regulation of H(2)S production by CSE has not well been understood. Here we show that H(2)S producing activity of CSE is regulated by intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. In the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) CSE efficiently produces H(2)S at the steady-state low Ca(2+) concentrations but is suppressed at high Ca(2+) concentrations. In the absence of PLP H(2)S production maintains the suppressed levels at high Ca(2+) concentrations and decreased further at low Ca(2+) concentrations. These observations suggest that CSE produces H(2)S at the steady-state in cells and that the production is suppressed when the intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations are increased.

PURPOSE: Mice with moderate/severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency or absence of the cbs gene encoding cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) have marked retinal disruption, ganglion cell loss, optic nerve mitochondrial dysfunction, and ERG defects; those with mild hyperhomocysteinemia have delayed retinal morphological/functional phenotype. Excess homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases; however, it is not known whether excess homocysteine alters retinal vasculature.METHODS: Cbs(+/+), cbs(+/-), and cbs(-/-) mice (age ~3 weeks) were subjected to angiography; retinas were harvested for cryosections, flat-mount preparations, or trypsin digestion and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize vessels using isolectin-B4, to detect angiogenesis using anti-VEGF and anti-endoglin (anti-CD105) and activated glial cells (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein [anti-GFAP]) and to investigate the blood-retinal barrier using the tight junction markers zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Expression of vegf was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were treated with excess homocysteine to analyze permeability.RESULTS: Angiography revealed vascular leakage in cbs(-/-) mice; immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated vascular patterns consistent with ischemia; isolectin-B4 labeling revealed a capillary-free zone centrally and new vessels with capillary tufts midperipherally. This was associated with increased vegf mRNA and protein, CD105, and GFAP in cbs(-/-) retinas concomitant with a marked decrease in ZO-1 and occludin. Homocysteine-treated HRECs showed increased permeability.CONCLUSIONS: Severe elevation of homocysteine in cbs(-/-) mutant mice is accompanied by alterations in retinal vasculature (ischemia, neovascularization, and incompetent blood-retinal barrier). The marked disruption of retinal structure and decreased visual function reported in cbs(-/-) mice may reflect vasculopathy as well as neuropathy.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is the third endogenous signaling gasotransmitter, following nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. It is physiologically generated by cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine-ß-synthase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. H(2)S has been gaining increasing attention as an important endogenous signaling molecule because of its significant effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Substantial evidence shows that H(2)S is involved in aging by inhibiting free-radical reactions, activating SIRT1, and probably interacting with the age-related gene Klotho. Moreover, H(2)S has been shown to have therapeutic potential in age-associated diseases. This article provides an overview of the physiological functions and effects of H(2)S in aging and age-associated diseases, and proposes the potential health and therapeutic benefits of H(2)S.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) functions as a neuromodulator, but whether it modulates visceral pain is not well known. This study was designed to determine the role for the endogenous H2S producing enzyme cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in a validated rat model of visceral hyperalgesia (VH).METHODS: VH was induced by nine-day heterotypic intermittent stress (HIS). Abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores were determined by measuring the visceromoter responses to colorectal distension (CRD). Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons innervating the colon were labeled by injection of DiI (1,1'-dioleyl-3,3,3',3-tetramethylindocarbocyanine methanesulfonate) into the colon wall. Patch clamp recording techniques were employed to examine excitability and sodium channel currents of colon specific DRG neurons. Tissues from colon related thoracolumbar DRGs were analyzed for CBS, CSE and sodium channel expression.RESULTS: HIS significantly increased the visceromotor responses to CRD in association with an upregulated expression of CBS not CSE proteins in colon related DRGs. Administration of O-(Carboxymethyl)hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (AOAA), an inhibitor of CBS, attenuated the AWR scores in HIS-treated rats, in a dose dependent fashion. In contrast, AOAA did not produce any effect on AWR scores in healthy control rats. AOAA reversed the potentiation of sodium channel current densities of colon specific DRG neurons of HIS rats. To further confirm the role for CBS-H2S signaling, NaHS was used to mimic the production of H2S by CBS. Application of NaHS significantly enhanced neuronal excitability and potentiated sodium channel current densities of colon DRG neurons from healthy control rats. Furthermore, AOAA reversed the upregulation of Na(V)1.7 and Na(V)1.8 in colon related DRGs of HIS rats.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that upregulation of CBS expression might play an important role in developing VH via sensitization of sodium channels in peripheral nociceptors, thus identifying a specific neurobiological target for the treatment of VH in functional bowel syndromes.

1. The aim of the study was to determine if H(2)S is involved in the development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in broilers, a condition frequently observed in a variety of cardiac and pulmonary diseases. 2. Two-week-old broilers were reared under normoxic conditions or exposed to normobaric hypoxia (6 h/day) with tissue levels of H(2)S adjusted by administering sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, 10 µmol/kg body weight/day). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular mass, plasma and tissue H(2)S levels, the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CSE) and vascular remodeling were determined at 35 d of age. 3. Exposure to hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension was characterized by elevated pulmonary pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling. This was accompanied by decreased expression of CSE and decreased concentrations of plasma and tissue H(2)S. 4. Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension was significantly reduced by administration of NaHS but this protective effect was largely abolished by D, L-propargylglycerine, an inhibitor of CSE. 5. The results indicate that H(2)S is involved in the development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Supplementing NaHS or H(2)S could be a strategy for reducing hypoxia-induced hypertension in broilers.

OBJECTIVE: The primary aims of this study were to (i) determine whether folate metabolism genetic polymorphisms predict age of onset and occurrence of late life depression; and (ii) determine whether folate metabolism genetic polymorphisms predict response to antidepressant medications in late-life depression.METHODS: This study used the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Depression and the Neurocognitive Outcomes of Depression in the Elderly Study database, which includes individuals aged =60. The folate nutrition assessment was determined by the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire. Genotype was evaluated for 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 10 folate metabolism genes. Logistic regression models were used to examine genetic polymorphisms and folate estimates with association with depression age of onset and remission status.RESULTS: There were 304 Caucasians in the database, 106 of these were not depressed and 198 had a diagnosis of depression. There were no significant differences between remitters and non-remitters in age, sex or estimated folate intakes. There were no folate estimates or folate metabolism gene single nucleotide polymorphisms that significantly predicted age of onset of depression or occurrence of depression. Methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) A66G (rs1801394) was significantly associated with remission status (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0077) such that those with the AA genotype were 3.2 times as likely as those with the GG genotype to be in remission (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0020). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase A1298C (rs1801131) achieved a borderline significance for association with remission status (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0313).CONCLUSION: The major finding from this study is that the MTRR A66G genotype predicts response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in late life depression.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous gas molecule synthesized by cystathionine-ß-synthetase (CBS), is involved in inflammation and nociceptive signaling. However, the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of CBS-H(2)S signaling in peripheral nociceptive processing remain unknown. We demonstrated that peripheral inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund adjuvant significantly up-regulated expression of CBS at both protein and mRNA levels in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The CBS inhibitors hydroxylamine and aminooxyacetic acid attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner and reversed hyperexcitability of DRG neurons in inflamed rats. Intraplantar administration of NaHS (its addition mimics CBS production of H(2)S) or l-cysteine in healthy rats elicited mechanical hyperalgesia. Application of NaHS in vitro enhanced excitability and tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium current of DRG neurons from healthy rats, which was attenuated by pretreatment of protein kinase A inhibitor H89. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing demonstrated that promoter region of cbs gene was less methylated in DRG samples from inflamed rats than that from controls. Peripheral inflammation did not alter expression of DNA methyltransferase 3a and 3b, the 2 major enzymes for DNA methylation, but led to a significant up-regulation of methyl-binding domain protein 4 and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 45a, the enzymes involved in active DNA demethylation. Our findings suggest that epigenetic regulation of CBS expression may contribute to inflammatory hyperalgesia. H(2)S seems to increase TTX-resistant sodium channel current, which may be mediated by protein kinase A pathway, thus identifying a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic visceral hyperalgesia (CVH) that manifested with persistent or recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel movement. However, the pathogenesis of the CVH remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate roles of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) producing enzyme cystathionine beta-synthetase (CBS) and p65 nuclear factor-kappa B subunits in CVH.RESULTS: CVH was induced by neonatal maternal deprivation (NMD) in male rats on postnatal days 2-15 and behavioral experiments were conducted at the age of 7-15 weeks. NMD significantly increased expression of CBS in colon-innervating DRGs from the 7th to 12th week. This change in CBS express is well correlated with the time course of enhanced visceromoter responses to colorectal distention (CRD), an indicator of visceral pain. Administration of AOAA, an inhibitor of CBS, produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect on NMD rats while it had no effect on age-matched healthy control rats. AOAA also reversed the enhanced neuronal excitability seen in colon-innervating DRGs. Application of NaHS, a donor of H2S, increased excitability of colon-innervating DRG neurons acutely dissociated from healthy control rats. Intrathecal injection of NaHS produced an acute visceral hyperalgesia. In addition, the content of p65 in nucleus was remarkably higher in NMD rats than that in age-matched controls. Intrathecal administration of PDTC, an inhibitor of p65, markedly reduced expression of CBS and attenuated nociceptive responses to CRD.CONCLUSION: The present results suggested that upregulation of CBS expression, which is mediated by activation of p65, contributes to NMD-induced CVH. This pathway might be a potential target for relieving CVH in patients with IBS.

AIMS: To investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) produced analgesic effect and whether nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) involved in EA-mediated analgesia in painful diabetic neuropathy in rats.METHODS: Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in adult female rats. Mechanical pain threshold was measured by von Frey filaments. EA was applied at acupoint Zu-San-Li (ST-36) in both hindlimbs. Western blot analysis was employed to detect changes in protein levels of NF-<U+03BA>B and CBS in spinal dorsal root ganglion (DRGs).RESULTS: Mechanical allodynia was developed 2 weeks after STZ injection and lasted for another 4 weeks. STZ injection significantly enhanced expression of p65 and CBS in lumbar L4-6 DRGs when compared with age-matched controls. EA markedly attenuated mechanical allodynia. Importantly, EA treatment remarkably inhibited p65 and CBS expression in DRGs. Additionally, intrathecal injection of the p65 antagonist pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate attenuated mechanical allodynia and markedly inhibited CBS expression in DRGs in STZ rats.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that EA produced an analgesic effect, which might be mediated at least in a part by inhibition of NF-<U+03BA>B signaling pathway in primary sensory neurons in rats with diabetes.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), is a member of the novel family of endogenous gaseous transmitters, termed &quot;gasotransmitters exhibiting diverse physiological activities, and is generated in mammalian tissues mainly by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) in conjunction with cysteine (aspartate) aminotranferase (CAT). The distributions of these enzymes are species- and tissue-specific. The liver, as the main organ that generates H(2)S in vivo, functions in biotransformation and metabolism. However, the liver is vulnerable to damage from internal and external factors, including inflammatory mediators, drugs and poisons. The present study evaluated the endogenous CBS-H(2)S synthesis regulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis of hepatic cells. The rat hepatic cell line, BRL, was incubated with LPS for various time periods to establish a cell-damage model. Incubation with LPS resulted in a significant increase in CBS expression and H(2)S production. It also stimulated apoptosis and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment with the CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) or CBS small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased LPS-enhanced H(2)S production. Notably, apoptosis increased for a short period and then decreased gradually, while the mitochondrial membrane potential demonstrated the opposite trend. These results showed that endogenous CBS-H(2)S synthesis demonstrated early anti-apoptotic activity and subsequent pro-apoptotic activity in LPS-induced apoptosis. These results suggest a new approach for developing novel drugs for this condition.

Homocystinuria is a neurometabolic disease caused by a severe deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase activity, resulting in severe hyperhomocysteinemia. Affected patients present several symptoms including a variable degree of motor dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia on the cell viability of the mitochondrion, as well as on some parameters of energy metabolism, such as glucose oxidation and activities of pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, respiratory chain complexes and creatine kinase in gastrocnemius rat skeletal muscle. We also evaluated the effect of creatine on biochemical alterations elicited by hyperhomocysteinemia. Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous injections of homocysteine (0.3-0.6<U+2009>µmol/g body weight) and/or creatine (50<U+2009>mg/kg body weight) from the 6th to the 28th days of age. The animals were decapitated 12<U+2009>h after the last injection. Homocysteine decreased the cell viability of the mitochondrion and the activities of pyruvate kinase and creatine kinase. Succinate dehydrogenase was increased other evaluated parameters were not changed by this amino acid. Creatine, when combined with homocysteine, prevented or caused a synergistic effect on some changes provoked by this amino acid. Creatine per se or creatine plus homocysteine altered glucose oxidation. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which homocysteine exerts its effects on skeletal muscle function, more studies are needed to elucidate them. Although creatine prevents some alterations caused by homocysteine, it should be used with caution, mainly in healthy individuals because it could change the homeostasis of normal physiological functions.

DNA methylation is linked to homocysteine metabolism through the generation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-Adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). The ratio of AdoMet/AdoHcy is often considered an indicator of tissue methylation capacity. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship of tissue AdoMet and AdoHcy concentrations to allele-specific methylation and expression of genomically imprinted H19/Igf2. Expression of H19/Igf2 is regulated by a differentially methylated domain (DMD), with H19 paternally imprinted and Igf2 maternally imprinted. F1 hybrid C57BL/6J x Castaneous/EiJ (Cast) mice with (+/-), and without (+/+), heterozygous disruption of cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs) were fed a control diet or a diet (called HH) to induce hyperhomocysteinemia and changes in tissue AdoMet and AdoHcy. F1 Cast x Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet had significantly higher plasma total homocysteine concentrations, higher liver AdoHcy, and lower AdoMet/AdoHcy ratios and this was accompanied by lower liver maternal H19 DMD allele methylation, lower liver Igf2 mRNA levels, and loss of Igf2 maternal imprinting. In contrast, we found no significant differences in AdoMet and AdoHcy in brain between the diet groups but F1 Cast x Cbs+/- mice fed the HH diet had higher maternal H19 DMD methylation and lower H19 mRNA levels in brain. A significant negative relationship between AdoHcy and maternal H19 DMD allele methylation was found in liver but not in brain. These findings suggest the relationship of AdoMet and AdoHcy to gene-specific DNA methylation is tissue-specific and that changes in DNA methylation can occur without changes in AdoMet and AdoHcy.

Anther formation and dehiscence are complex pivotal processes in reproductive development. The secondary wall thickening in endothecial cells of the anther is a known prerequisite for successful anther dehiscence. However, many gaps remain in our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying anther dehiscence in planta, including a possible role for jasmonic acid (JA) and H(2)O(2) in secondary wall thickening of endothecial cells. Here, we report that the cystathionine ß-synthase domain-containing protein CBSX2 located in the chloroplast plays a critical role in thickening of the secondary cell walls of the endothecium during anther dehiscence in Arabidopsis. A T-DNA insertion mutant of CBSX2 (cbsx2) showed increased secondary wall thickening of endothecial cells and early anther dehiscence. Consistently, overexpression of CBSX2 resulted in anther indehiscence. Exogenous JA application induced secondary wall thickening and caused flower infertility in the cbsx2 mutant, whereas it partially restored fertility in the CBSX2-overexpressing lines lacking the wall thickening. CBSX2 directly modulated thioredoxin (Trx) in chloroplasts, which affected the level of H(2)O(2) and, consequently, expression of the genes involved in secondary cell wall thickening. Our findings have revealed that CBSX2 modulates the H(2)O(2) status, which is linked to the JA response and in turn controls secondary wall thickening of the endothecial cells in anthers for dehiscence to occur.

BACKGROUND: In order to correctly assess the efficacy of therapy or diet in intervention studies on the activity of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) a sensitive analytical method is necessary.METHODS: An electrospray LC-MS/MS method preceded by a solid phase extraction step was developed for the measurement of CBS activity in cell extracts. Nonafluoropentanoic acid was used as an ionpair to provide the underivatized cystathionine the desired retention on a C18 column.RESULTS: A detection limit of 50pmol cystathionine/h/mg protein was achieved. In fibroblasts, intra- and inter-assay CVs for the CBS activity were 5.2% and 14.7%, respectively. A K(m) value of 8µmol/L for homocysteine, and 2.5µmol/L for serine was calculated. In fibroblasts wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous CBS activity ranges measured were 8.5-27.0, 4.2-13.4, 0.0-0.7nmol/h×mg protein, respectively. The method was applied to a study where rats were fed 2 diets. Increase of dietary methionine (7.7 versus 3.8mg/kg methionine) significantly increased the CBS activity in rat liver lysates from a median of 58.0 to a median of 71.5 (P=0.037)nmol/h×mg protein. In a lymphoblasts cell culture experiment, the addition of Hcy to the culture media increased the activity of CBS 3 fold.CONCLUSION: This LC-MS/MS is able to diagnose CBS deficiency at the enzyme level, and can accurately measure the effect diets or therapy might have on the CBS activity in a variety of cell types.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter. Although it has been shown to elicit responses in vascular and other smooth muscle preparations, a role for endogenously produced H2S in mediating airway tone has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether H2S is produced within the airways and to determine the functional effect on airway tone.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Small peripheral airways (&lt;5 mm in diameter) from porcine lungs were set up in isolated tissue baths, pre-contracted with the muscarinic agonist carbachol, and then exposed to either the H2S donor sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), or the precursor L-cysteine. H2S production from L-cysteine or 3-mercaptopyruvate in tissue homogenates was measured by the methylene blue assay. Expression of the H2S-synthesizing enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (3-MST) were measured by Western blotting.KEY RESULTS: NaHS caused a large relaxation of the airways, which was inhibited partially by pre-contraction with KCl or exposure to tetraethylammonium, but not glibenclamide, paxilline or 4-aminopyridine. L-cysteine also caused a relaxation of the airways which was inhibited by the CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid. Tissue homogenates from airways exposed to L-cysteine or 3-mercaptopyruvate in vitro showed a significant production of H2S. Western blotting demonstrated immunoreactivity to CBS, CSE and 3-MST enzymes in the airways.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data demonstrate that H2S can be produced endogenously within porcine airways causing relaxation. The mechanism of relaxation depends, in part, on K(+) channel activity.
