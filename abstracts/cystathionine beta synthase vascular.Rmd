Homocysteine-Methionine (HM) cycle produces universal methyl group donor S-adenosylmethione (SAM), methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and homocysteine (Hcy). Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is established as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other degenerative disease. We selected 115 genes in the extended HM cycle (31 metabolic enzymes and 84 methyltransferases), examined their protein subcellular location/partner protein, investigated their mRNA levels and mapped their corresponding histone methylation status in 35 disease conditions via mining a set of public databases and intensive literature research. We have 6 major findings. 1) All HM metabolic enzymes are located only in the cytosol except for cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), which was identified in both cytosol and nucleus. 2) Eight disease conditions encountered only histone hypomethylation on 8 histone residues (H3R2/K4/R8/K9/K27/K36/K79 and H4R3). Nine disease conditions had only histone hypermethylation on 8 histone residues (H3R2/K4/K9/K27/K36/K79 and H4R3/K20). 3) We classified 9 disease types with differential HM cycle expression pattern. Eleven disease conditions presented most 4 HM cycle pathway suppression. 4) Three disease conditions had all 4 HM cycle pathway suppression and only histone hypomethylation on H3R2/K4/R8/K9/K36 and H4R3. 5) Eleven HM cycle metabolic enzymes interact with 955 proteins. 6) Five paired HM cycle proteins interact with each other. We conclude that HM cycle is a key metabolic sensor system which mediates receptor-independent metabolism-associated danger signal recognition and modulates SAM/SAH-dependent methylation in disease conditions and that hypomethylation on frequently modified histone residues is a key mechanism for metabolic disorders, autoimmune disease and CVD. We propose that HM metabolism takes place in the cytosol, that nuclear methylation equilibration requires a nuclear-cytosol transfer of SAM/SAH/Hcy, and that Hcy clearance is essential for genetic protection.

The dysregulation of pulmonary arterial vasoactive mediators or excessive proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) might result in contraction or remodeling of pulmonary blood vessels, leading to related lung diseases. Recent studies suggest that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous vasodilator generated in the blood vessels by the enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), could induce the vasodilation, thus improving contraction or remodeling-induced lung diseases. In this study, we hypothesized that PASMCs could produce H2S and relax the pulmonary artery, and its mechanism is related to CSE, CBS, and TRPV4 channels by affecting both the excessive proliferation and pulmonary vasoconstriction in PASMCs. We found that the sildenafil treatment could remarkably promote H2S production and control the proliferation in PASMCs; meanwhile, the protein levels of CSE and CBS and the intracellular concentration of calcium could also be increased by sildenafil. Moreover, the effects of sildenafil could be reversed by a CBS inhibitor or a CSE inhibitor, indicating that sildenafil could affect CSE and CBS to modulate the production of H2S and the proliferation in rat PASMCs. Together, we demonstrated a new mechanism for sildenafil to modulate the synthesis of H2S and cell proliferation in PASMCs by affecting CSE and CBS. TRPV4-dependent Ca events and BMP4 may also be involved.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: A phase 1/2 clinical trial was performed in individuals with cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) deficient homocystinuria with aims to: (a) assess pharmacokinetics and safety of taurine therapy, (b) evaluate oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular function in CBS deficiency, and (c) evaluate the impact of short-term taurine treatment.METHODS: Individuals with pyridoxine-nonresponsive CBS deficiency with homocysteine &gt;50<U+2009>µM, without inflammatory disorder or on antioxidant therapy were enrolled. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]), and disease-related metabolites obtained at baseline were compared to normal values. While maintaining current treatment, patients were treated with 75<U+2009>mg/kg taurine twice daily, and treatment response assessed after 4 hours and 4 days.RESULTS: Fourteen patients (8-35<U+2009>years; 8 males, 6 females) were enrolled with baseline homocysteine levels 161<U+2009>±<U+2009>67<U+2009>µM. The study found high-dose taurine to be safe when excluding preexisting hypertriglyceridemia. Taurine pharmacokinetics showed a rapid peak level returning to near normal levels at 12<U+2009>hours, but had slow accumulation and elevated predosing levels after 4 days of treatment. Only a single parameter of oxidative stress, 2,3-dinor-8-isoprostaglandin-F2a, was elevated at baseline, with no elevated inflammatory parameters, and no change in FMD values overall. Taurine had no effect on any of these parameters. However, the effect of taurine was strongly related to pretreatment FMD values; and taurine significantly improved FMD in the subset of individuals with pretreatment FMD values &lt;10% and in individuals with homocysteine levels &gt;125<U+2009>µM, pertinent to endothelial function.CONCLUSION: Taurine improves endothelial function in CBS-deficient homocystinuria in patients with preexisting reduced function.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The presence of CBS in mouse vascular endothelium was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The relaxant activity of L-serine (0.1-300 µM) and L-cysteine (0.1-300 µM) was estimated on mouse aorta rings, with or without endothelium. A pharmacological modulation study evaluated NO and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) involvement. Levels of NO and S1P were also measured following incubation of aorta tissue with either L-serine (1, 10, and 100 µM) or L-cysteine (10, 100 µM, and 1 mM).KEY RESULTS: L-serine relaxed aorta rings in an endothelium-dependent manner. The vascular effect was reduced by L-NG-nitro-arginine methyl ester and wortmaninn. A similar pattern was obtained with L-cysteine. The S1P1 receptor antagonist (W146) or the SPT inhibitor (myriocin) reduced either L-serine or L-cysteine relaxant effect. L-serine or L-cysteine incubation increased NO and S1P levels in mouse aorta.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: L-serine, a by-product formed within the transsulfuration pathway starting from L-cysteine via CBS, contributes to the vasodilator action of L-cysteine. The L-serine effect involves both NO and S1P. This mechanism could be involved in the marked dysregulation of vascular tone in hyperhomocysteinemic patients (CBS deficiency) and may represent a feasible therapeutic target.

The combination of traditional Chinese medicines can improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. Furthermore, the combination of the traditional Chinese medicine curcuma zedoary and kelp was used to enhance the effect of the dissipation of blood stasis in pediatrics during the Song Dynasty. Curcumenol and laminarin, the main components of curcuma zedoary and kelp, are also reported to have a wide range of biological activities. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp may prevent the development of cancer. The aim of this research was to confirm whether a combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of hepatoma cells and consequently improve prognosis. In this study, we firstly found in H22-bearing mice that the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp inhibited tumor growth and the expression of metastasis-related proteins (MMPs, VEGF, pAkt, pERK1/2). Meanwhile, the decreased cystathionine beta synthase (CBS, an endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthetase) level was also observed in H22-bearing mice admistrated with the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp. It was also observed that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the potential inhibiting mechanism of the combination of curcumenol and laminarin on HepG2 cell proliferation and metastasis. Our previous research showed that a CBS/H2S system was vital for maintaining the proliferation in hepatoma cells. Here, we found that the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 were decreased in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells and the combination of curcumenol and laminarin significantly decreased the H2S level in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated the levels of pSTAT3 and BCL-2 in HepG2 cells. Angiogenesis, positively regulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is essential for human cancer metastasis. In the present study, we found that the combination of curcumenol and laminarin could significantly down-regulate the expression levels of VEGF and its downstream key genes pAkt and pERK1/2. Furthermore, previous research showed that hydrogen sulfide could stimulate angiogenesis. Here, we also observed the reduction of the VEGF, Akt, pAkt, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 proteins levels and the inhibition of proliferation and metastasis in CBS knockdown HepG2 cells. Moreover, exogenous H2S rescued the cytological results caused by the combination of curcumenol and laminarin. Taken together, the combination of curcuma zedoary and kelp could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting endogenous H2S production and down-regulating the pSTAT3/BCL-2 and VEGF pathway, which provides strong evidence for the application of curcuma zedoary and kelp in treatments of liver cancer.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent vasodilator and proangiogenic second messenger synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH). Estrogens are potent vasodilators that stimulate H2S biosynthesis in uterine arteries (UA) in vivo; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that estrogens stimulate H2S biosynthesis in UA endothelial cells (UAEC) via specific estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent mechanisms. In cultured primary UAEC, treatment with estradiol-17ß (E2ß) stimulated CBS and CTH mRNAs and proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. As little as 0.1 nM E2ß was effective in increasing CBS and CTH expressions and these stimulatory effects maximized with 10-100 nM E2ß at 48-72 h. E2ß also activated CBS and CTH promoters in UAEC, leading to CBS and CTH expression. Treatment with E2ß stimulated H2S production, which was blocked by specific inhibitors of either CBS or CTH and their combination and the ER antagonist ICI 182780. Treatment with either specific agonist of ERa or ERß stimulated both CBS and CTH mRNA and protein expressions and H2S production to levels similar to that of E2ß. Specific antagonist of either ERa or ERß blocked E2ß-stimulated CBS and CTH mRNA and protein expressions and H2S production. Combinations of either ERa or ERß agonists or their antagonists had no additive effects. Thus, E2ß stimulates H2S production by upregulating CBS and CTH mRNA and protein expressions through specific ERa or ERß-dependent CBS and CTH transcription in UAEC in vitro.

AIMS: The induction of excessive autophagy by increased levels of oxidative stress is one of the main mechanisms underlying unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to have an anti-oxidative effect, but its mode of action on excessive autophagy in vascular endothelial cells is unclear.METHODS: Surgery was used to induce UUO in male C57BL/6 mice as an in vivo model. Human renal epithelial cells (HK-2) were treated with H2O2 as an in vitro model. NaHS was used as an exogenous H2S donor. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to observe the structure of renal autophagosomes. The expression of proteins related to autophagy and apoptosis was detected by western blot analysis in vivo and in vitro. Flow cytometry (DCFH-DA) was used to examine the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to detect cell apoptosis. Compound C was used to analyze the association of AMPK with autophagy.RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, in which the ureter was exposed but not ligated, the cell apoptosis index, number of autophagosomes, protein expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (LC3)-II/I, beclin-1, and p-AMPK/AMPK were significantly increased in the UUO group. On the other hand, p62, cystathionine ß-synthase, and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase protein expression levels and H2S concentration were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). These alterations were ameliorated by the addition of NaHS (p &lt; 0.05). Similar results were observed in vitro. By using the AMPK inhibitor compound C, it was indicated that AMPK was involved in ROS-induced autophagy. In addition, using tissue from patients with obstructive nephropathy, excessive autophagy was observed by an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.CONCLUSION: NaHS-treatment may exert a protective effect on mouse kidney against UUO by suppressing the ROS-AMPK pathway. ROS-AMPK-mediated autophagy may represent a promising therapeutic target for obstructive nephropathy.

Homocystinuria is a congenital metabolic disorder in which cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency results in a prominent increase in homocysteine (serum levels &gt;<U+2009>100 µM), causing mental retardation, atherosclerotic cerebral infarction, and osteoporosis accompanied by fragility fractures. Encountering a case with excessive homocysteinemia such as that seen in hereditary homocystinuria is unlikely during usual medical examinations. However, in individuals who have vitamin B or folate deficiency, serum homocysteine concentrations are known to increase. These individuals may also have a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, MTHFR (C677T: TT type), which regulates homocysteine metabolism. These changes in homocysteine levels may elicit symptoms resembling those of homocystinuria (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis).</AbstractText>: Homocystinuria is a congenital metabolic disorder in which cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency results in a prominent increase in homocysteine (serum levels &gt;<U+2009>100 µM), causing mental retardation, atherosclerotic cerebral infarction, and osteoporosis accompanied by fragility fractures.

Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disorder most commonly caused by cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency. Severe cases can cause white matter abnormalities that can mimic other vascular, toxic and metabolic disorders on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We present such a case which demonstrates not only extensive white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging, but also previously unreported basal ganglia signal abnormalities and imaging manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, likely caused by elevated methionine and betaine therapy. We also review the literature and discuss the potential underlying biologic mechanisms of these imaging findings.

Elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels have been reported to be involved in liver injury, and autophagy plays an important role in normal hepatic physiology and pathophysiology, but the mechanism underlying Hcy regulated autophagy is currently unknown. In this study, CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice were fed with regular diet for 12 weeks to establish a hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) model and HL-7702 cells were treated with Hcy, we found that Hcy increases autophagy and aggravates liver injury by downregulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of CFTR inhibited the formation of autophagosomes and the expression of autophagy-related proteins BECN1, LC3-II/I and Atg12, while the expression of p62 increased in Hcy-treated hepatocytes and CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice injected with lentivirus expressing CFTR. Further study showed that CFTR expression is regulated by the interaction of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which, respectively, regulate DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). In conclusion, our study showed that Hcy activates autophagy by inhibition of CFTR expression via interaction between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in the mouse liver. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of Hcy-induced autophagy in liver injury.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mainly synthesized by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CTH), has been implicated in regulating placental angiogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This study was to test a hypothesis that trophoblasts synthesize H2S to promote placental angiogenesis. Human choriocarcinoma-derived BeWo cells expressed both CBS and CTH proteins, while the first trimester villous trophoblast-originated HTR-8/SVneo cells expressed CTH protein only. The H2S producing ability of BeWo cells was significantly inhibited by either inhibitors of CBS (carboxymethyl hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride, CHH) or CTH (ß-cyano-L-alanine, BCA) and that in HTR-8/SVneo cells was inhibited by CHH only. H2S donors stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in ovine placental artery endothelial cells (oFPAECs) as effectively as vascular endothelial growth factor. Co-culture with BeWo and HTR-8/SVneo cells stimulated oFPAEC migration, which was inhibited by CHH or BCA in BeWo but CHH only in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Primary human villous trophoblasts (HVT) were more potent than trophoblast cell lines in stimulating oFPAEC migration that was inhibited by CHH and CHH/BCA combination in accordance with its H2S synthesizing activity linked to CBS and CTH expression patterns. H2S donors activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), and extracellular signal-activated kinase 1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1, MAPK3/1) in oFPAECs. H2S donor-induced NOS3 activation was blocked by AKT1 but not MAPK3/1 inhibition. In keeping with our previous studies showing a crucial role of AKT1, MAPK3/1, and NOS3/NO in placental angiogenesis, these data show that trophoblast-derived endogenous H2S stimulates placental angiogenesis, involving activation of AKT1, NOS3/NO, and MAPK3/1.

Anticoagulant therapy is prescribed to millions of patients worldwide for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis. Evidence has indicated that edoxaban is a potential drug of oral anticoagulant in the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism. Hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine plasma concentration are indicators of cardiovascular and neurovascular disease risk factors that have attracted considerable attention for regulation of vascular health and homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanism of edoxaban-mediated differences of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine has not been investigated in the progression of venous thrombosis. In the present study, the authors analyzed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in the vein endothelial cells and expression levels of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine. Homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism through transsulfuration and that transsulfuration capacity and hydrogen sulfide availability have been investigated both in vitro and in vivo following treatment with edoxaban. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) levels were studied in a cell model and rat model of vein thrombosis prior and post treatment of edoxaban. The therapeutic effects of edoxaban for rats with vein thrombosis were determined by clinical diagnose scores. The results demonstrated that edoxaban increased expression levels of hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine in microvascular endothelial cells. It was observed that the transsulfuration enzymes, CBS and CGL levels were upregulated in murine microvascular endothelial cells. The MMP-9 expression level and activity and homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism were increased in murine microvascular endothelial cells following edoxaban treatment. In addition, CBS and CGL activities were upregulated in murine microvascular endothelial cells and a rat model of venous thrombosis following treatment with edoxaban. Furthermore, it was observed that edoxaban increased PI3K and AKT expression both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, edoxaban significantly improved endothelial injury and inhibited thrombosis factors expression in rat model of venous thrombosis. In conclusion, these findings suggested that edoxaban can improve venous thrombosis by decreasing hydrogen sulfide and homocysteine through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Congenital heart defects are structural cardiovascular malformations that arise from abnormal formation of the heart or major blood vessels during the fetal period. To investigate the association of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MTHFD1, eNOS, CBS and ACE genes, we evaluated their relationship with CHD in Iranian patients. In this case-control study, a total of 102 children with CHD and 98 control children were enrolled. Four SNPs including MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T, CBS C-4673G and ACE A2350G were genotyped by PCR-SSCP, Multiplex ARMS PCR and PCR-RFLP methods and confirmed by direct sequencing. We genotyped 102 patients and 98 controls for four polymorphisms by statistically analysis. There were three SNPs including MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T and ACE A2350G which might increase the risk of CHD, but CBS C-4673G was not significantly different between patients and controls. (P = 0.017, P = 0.048, P = 0.025 and P = 0.081 respectively). The allele frequencies of three SNPs for MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T and ACE A2350G in CHD are higher than that in control. Our results show that there is a significant relationship between MTHFD1 G1958A, eNOS G894T and ACE A2350G polymorphisms with CHD. Therefore, The AA and GA genotypes of MTHFD1 G1958A, TT and GT genotypes of eNOS G894T and the AA and GA genotypes of ACE A2350G are susceptible factors for CHD and may increase the risk of CHD.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, particularly during pathological processes. Experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), which is caused by vascular leakage into the brain, is characterized by inflammation, neurological deficits and cerebral hemorrhage. The present study investigated the correlation between ECM genesis and the levels of H2S. The results indicated that the levels of H2S derived from the brain decreased over time following ECM infection, and that the low H2S bioavailability was partially caused by decreased expression of the H2S generating enzyme, cystathionine-ß-synthase. Administration of NaHS (an exogenous donor of H2S) provided protection against ECM. NaHS inhibited the destruction of the blood brain barrier and the secretion of proinflammatory biomarkers, including interluekin-18, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and serum cluster of differentiation 40 into the brain during ECM. In conclusion, these results suggested that low levels of H2S in brain contributed to the progression of ECM, and that H2S donor administration may represent a potential protective therapy against ECM.

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesized via metabolizing L-cysteine by cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) is a potent vasodilator and angiogenic factor. The objectives of this study were to determine if human uterine artery (UA) H2S production increases with augmented expression and/or activity of CBS and/or CSE during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy and whether exogenous H2S dilates UA. Uterine arteries from nonpregnant (NP) premenopausal proliferative (pPRM) and secretory (sPRM) phases of the menstrual cycle and pregnant (P) women were studied. H2S production was measured by the methylene blue assay. CBS and CSE mRNAs were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, and proteins were assessed by immunoblotting and semiquantitative immunofluorescence microscopy. Effects of H2S on rat UA relaxation were determined by wire myography ex vivo. H2S production was greater in NP pPRM and P than NP sPRM UAs and inhibited by the specific CBS but not CSE inhibitor. CBS but not CSE mRNA and protein were greater in NP pPRM and P than NP sPRM UAs. CBS protein was localized to endothelium and smooth muscle and its levels were in a quantitative order of P &gt;NP UAs of pPRM&gt;sPRM. CSE protein was localized in UA endothelium and smooth muscle with no difference among groups. A H2S donor relaxed P &gt; NP UAs but not mesentery artery. Thus, human UA H2S production is augmented with endothelium and smooth muscle CBS upregulation, contributing to UA vasodilation in the estrogen-dominant physiological states in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.

METHODS: Anesthetized and instrumented FBM &quot;familial hypercholesterolemia Bretoncelles Meishan&quot; pigs with high-fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis were subjected to polymicrobial septic shock, or sham procedure, and subsequent intensive care therapy for 24 h. Young German domestic pigs were used as naïve controls. CSE, CBS, 3-MST, HO-1, eNOS, and nitrotyrosine expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin sections.RESULTS: FBM pigs, in the absence of septic shock, showed decreased CSE expression in the media. This decrease became more pronounced after sepsis. The expression pattern of HO-1 resembled the pattern of CSE expression. CBS protein was not detected in the media of any of the CA examined but was localized to the adventitia and only in the atheromatous plaques containing foam cells of the CA, in regions that also displayed abundant nitrotyrosine formation. The CBS expression in the adventitia was not associated with nitrotyrosine formation. 3-MST expression was not found in any of the CA samples.CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that (i) the reduced CSE expression in FBM pigs may contribute to their cardiovascular disease phenotype and moreover (ii) the further decrease in CA CSE expression in sepsis may contribute to the sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction.

A major reason for vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting is neointimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. Elevated serum levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, but homocysteine levels also tend to increase during the first weeks or months after cardiac surgery. To investigate this further, C57BL/6J mice (WT) and cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygous knockout mice (CBS+/-), a mouse model for hyperhomocysteinaemia, underwent interposition of the vena cava of donor mice into the carotid artery of recipient mice. Two experimental groups were examined: 20 mice of each group underwent bypass surgery (group 1: WT donor and WT recipient; group 2: CBS+/- donor and CBS+/- recipient). After 4 weeks, the veins were harvested, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, stained and analysed by histomorphology and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, serum Hcy levels in CBS knockout animals and in WT animals before and after bypass surgery were measured. At 4 weeks postoperatively, group 2 mice showed a higher percentage of thrombosis compared to controls, a threefold increase in neointima formation, higher general vascularization, a lower percentage of elastic fibres with shortage and fragmentation in the neointima, a lower percentage of acid mucopolysaccharides in the neointima and a more intense fibrosis in the neointima and media. In conclusion, hyperhomocysteinaemic cystathionine-beta-synthase knockout mice can play an important role in the study of mechanisms of vein graft failure. But further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to answer the question whether or not homocysteine itself or a related metabolic factor is the key aetiologic agent for accelerated vein graft disease.

Alcohol is the most socially accepted addictive drug. Alcohol consumption is associated with some health problems such as neurological, cognitive, behavioral deficits, cancer, heart, and liver disease. Mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity are presently not yet clear. One of the mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity has to do with its interaction with amino acid homocysteine (Hcy), which has been linked with brain neurotoxicity. Elevated Hcy impairs with various physiological mechanisms in the body, especially metabolic pathways. Hcy metabolism is predominantly controlled by epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and acetylation. An alteration in these processes leads to epigenetic modification. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the role of Hcy metabolism abnormalities in alcohol-induced toxicity with epigenetic adaptation and their influences on cerebrovascular pathology.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) has been observed to promote hypertension, but the mechanisms are unclear. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is a cellular membrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types of the vasculature. TLR-4 activation has been known to promote inflammation that has been associated with the pathogenesis of hypertension. In this study we hypothesize that HHcy induces hypertension by TLR-4 activation, which promotes inflammatory cytokine (IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a) upregulation and initiation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, leading to cell death and chronic vascular inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we used C57BL/6J (WT) mice, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-deficient (CBS<sup>+/-</sup>) mice with genetic mild HHcy, C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice with TLR-4 mutation, and mice with combined genetic HHcy and TLR-4 mutation (CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H). Ultrasonography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) detected an increase in wall-to-lumen ratio, resistive index (RI), and pulsatility index (PI). Tail cuff blood pressure (BP) measurement revealed elevated BP in CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice. RI, PI, and wall-to-lumen ratio of the SMA in CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H mice were similar to the control group, and BP was significantly alleviated. TLR-4, IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-a expression were upregulated in the SMA of CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice and reduced in the SMA of CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H mice. Molecules involved in the mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway (BAX, caspase-9, and caspase-3) were upregulated in CBS<sup>+/-</sup> mice and attenuated in CBS<sup>+/-</sup>/C3H mice. We conclude that HHcy promotes TLR-4-driven chronic vascular inflammation and mitochondria-mediated cell death, inducing hypertension. TLR-4 mutation attenuates vascular inflammation and cell death, which suppress hypertension.

Cirrhosis is a end-stage disease of the liver in which fibrogenesis, angiogenesis and distortion of intrahepatic microcirculation lead to increased intrahepatic resistance to portal blood flow, a condition known as portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is maintained by a variety of molecular mechanisms including sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) hyporeactivity, activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), reduction in hepatic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity along with increased eNOS-derived NO generation in the splanchnic and systemic circulations. A reduction of the expression/function of the two major hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-producing enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), has also been demonstrated. A deficit in the transsulfuration pathway leading to the accumulation of homocysteine might contribute to defective generation of H2S and endothelial hyporeactivity. Bile acids are ligands for nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the G-protein bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1). FXR and GPBAR1 ligands regulate the expression/activity of CSE by both genomic and non-genomic effects and have been proved effective in protecting against endothelial dysfunction observed in rodent models of cirrhosis. GPBAR1, a receptor for secondary bile acids, is selectively expressed by LSECs and its activation increases the expression of CSE and attenuates the production of endotelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor agent. In vivo GPBAR1 ligand attenuates the imbalance between vasodilatory and vaso-constricting agents, making GPBAR1 a promising target in the treatment of portal hypertension.

PURPOSE: Vascular calcification (VC) is an impact of calcium accumulation in end-stage renal diseases, normally initiated in the mitochondria. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is effective in rescuing mitochondrial function in the neurovascular complications associated with VC, but has limitation in protecting the cardiac mitochondria. However, the STS efficacy in restoring the renal mitochondrial function has not been studied, which is the primary focus of this study.METHODS: Wistar rats (n = 6/group) were administered 0.75 % adenine in the diet for 28 days to induce renal failure. STS (400 mg/kg) was given in two regimens STS_Pre (preventive: along with adenine for 28 days) and STS_Cur (curative: 29th to 49th day). Renal failure was assessed by plasma and urinary markers. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed from oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial physiology and enzymology in the renal tissue.RESULTS: 0.75 % adenine diet caused renal medullary swelling, tubular interstitial nephropathy and impaired renal function (creatinine, urea, uric acid and ALP), which were recovered after STS treatment. The renal failure was due to oxidative stress as measured by elevated malondialdehyde (29 %) and lowered reduced glutathione (27 %) levels. STS reduced the lipid peroxidation and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) elevated the antioxidant enzymes. Further, it improved renal mitochondrial respiratory capacity by maintaining the hyperpolarized membrane potential and restored the complex enzyme activities. Absence of renal DNA fragmentation supports the above findings.CONCLUSION: STS protects the kidney by preserving renal mitochondria, in experimental adenine-induced vascular calcified rats. The efficacy was prominent when given after induction, i.e., in STS_Cur group.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive inborn error of metabolism in which patients have extremely elevated plasma total homocysteine and have clinical manifestations in the vascular, visual, skeletal, and nervous systems. Homocysteine is an intermediary metabolite produced from the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is a by-product of methylation reactions involving the methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Here, we have measured SAM, SAH, DNA and histone methylation status in an inducible mouse model of CBS deficiency to test the hypothesis that homocysteine-related phenotypes are caused by inhibition of methylation due to elevated SAH and reduced SAM/SAH ratio. We found that mice lacking CBS have elevated cellular SAH and reduced SAM/SAH ratios in both liver and kidney, but this was not associated with alterations in the level of 5-methylcytosine or various histone modifications. Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation in combination with microarray, we found that of the 241 most differentially methylated promoter probes, 89 % were actually hypermethylated in CBS deficient mice. In addition, we did not find that changes in DNA methylation correlated well with changes in RNA expression in the livers of induced and uninduced CBS mice. Our data indicates that reduction in the SAM/SAH ratio, due to loss of CBS activity, does not result in overall hypomethylation of either DNA or histones.

Homocysteine (Hcy) and its metabolites Hcy-thiolactone, N-Hcy-protein, and S-Hcy-protein are implicated in vascular and neurological diseases. However, quantification of these metabolites remains challenging. Here I describe streamlined assays for these metabolites based on their conversion to Hcy-thiolactone. Free Hcy-thiolactone is extracted from the urine with chloroform/methanol. Total Hcy is converted to Hcy-thiolactone in the presence of 1 N HCl. Major urinary protein (MUP)-bound S-linked Hcy is liberated from the protein by reduction with dithiothreitol and converted to Hcy-thiolactone. Acid hydrolysis of MUP with 6 N HCl liberates N-linked Hcy as Hcy-thiolactone, which is then extracted with chloroform/methanol. Ferritin is used as an N-Hcy-protein standard and an authentic Hcy-thiolactone is used to monitor the efficiency of extraction. Hcy-thiolactone (free, derived from total Hcy, or from MUP-bound N-linked or S-linked Hcy) is separated by a cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, post-column derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde, and quantified by fluorescence. Using these assays with as little as 2-20 µL of urine I show that MUP carry N-linked and S-linked Hcy and that N-Hcy-MUP and S-Hcy-MUP and Hcy-thiolactone are severely elevated in cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient mice. These assays will facilitate examination of the role of protein-related Hcy metabolites in health and disease.

Homocystinuria is a disorder of sulfur metabolism pathway caused by deficiency of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). It is characterized by increased accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) in the cells and plasma. Increased homocysteine results in various vascular and neurological complications. Present strategies to lower cellular and plasma homocysteine levels include vitamin B6 intake, dietary methionine restriction, betaine supplementation, folate and vitamin B12 administration. However, these strategies are inefficient for treatment of homocystinuria. In recent years, advances have been made towards developing new strategies to treat homocystinuria. These mainly include functional restoration to mutant CBS, enhanced clearance of Hcy from the body, prevention of N-homocysteinylation-induced toxicity and inhibition of homocysteine-induced oxidative stress. In this review, we have exclusively discussed the recent advances that have been achieved towards the treatment of homocystinuria. The review is an attempt to help clinicians in developing effective therapeutic strategies and designing novel drugs against homocystinuria.

We sought to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins, the key factors of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, in placenta.METHODS: Placental tissues were obtained from pregnant women with preeclampsia and healthy pregnant women who underwent elective cesarean section. Explants and trophoblasts were isolated from healthy placentas and treated with H2S donor and precursor. Western blotting was used to determine the levels of cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). The levels of VEGF mRNA, miR miR-200c,-20a and -20b were determined by quantitative real time PCR.RESULTS: NaHS and l-cysteine increased VEGF but not placenta growth factor (PlGF) production in cultured explants and trophoblasts. Transfection of CBS and CSE siRNA reversed the stimulatory effect of l-cysteine on VEGF production in placental cells. H2S prolonged the half-life of VEGF mRNA and decreased the expression of miR-200c,-20a and -20b in placental cells. MiR-200c mimic and inhibitor affected VEGF mRNA and protein level, whereas miR-20a or -20b mimic and inhibitor affect VEGF protein release but not mRNA expression. The expression level of miR-200c,-20a and -20b as well as the level of CBS, CSE and VEGF were downregulated in preeclamptic placentas.CONCLUSION: H2S produced via CSE and CBS plays a critical role in VEGF production in human placenta. Reduced expression of CSE and CBS may contribute to the abnormal production of angiogenic factors in preeclamptic placenta.

OBJECTIVES: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The transsulfuration pathway may be involved in its pathophysiology, since homocysteine, cystathionine and cysteine are increased in PE. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) is a key-enzyme in the pathway, converting homocysteine into cysteine via cystathionine. Another product of CBS is hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a vasodilatory, proangiogenic and cytoprotective gas that is thought to play a role in placental and vascular function during pregnancy. Since single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect CBS expression and/or function, we studied tag-SNPs in the CBS gene in PE patients.STUDY DESIGN: Controls (n=75), early-onset (n=45), and late-onset PE (n=52) cases were genotyped for six tag-SNPs in the CBS gene; rs12329764, rs2851391, rs234713, rs234706, rs1789953, and rs11203172. Plasma homocysteine, cysteine and cystathionine were determined during pregnancy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early-onset PE, late-onset PE.RESULTS: Women with the minor allele of rs11203172 have a reduced risk for early-onset PE. Compared to women without the minor allele, normotensive pregnant women with the minor allele of rs11203172 and rs234713 have lower cysteine levels. Women with the minor allele of rs1789953 have increased levels of cysteine and cystathionine, compared to women without.CONCLUSION: The CBS tag-SNP rs11203172 is associated with a decreased risk for early-onset PE. Decreased cysteine concentrations in normotensive pregnant women carrying the minor allele of rs11203172, may be due to increased cysteine conversion to H2S by CBS. Higher H2S levels may positively affect placentation and vascular function during pregnancy and decrease their risk for PE.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) functions in many physiological processes, including relaxation of vascular smooth muscles, mediation of neurotransmission, inhibition of insulin signaling, and regulation of inflammation. On the other hand, sulfane sulfur, which is a sulfur atom with six valence electrons but no charge, has the unique ability to bind reversibly to other sulfur atoms to form hydropersulfides (R-S-SH) and polysulfides (-S-Sn-S-). H2S and sulfane sulfur always coexist, and recent work suggests that sulfane sulfur species may be the actual signaling molecules in at least some biological phenomena. For example, one of the mechanisms of activity regulation of proteins by H2S is the S-sulfhydration of cysteine residues (protein Cys-SSH). In this review, we summarize recent progress on chemical tools for the study of H2S and sulfane sulfur, covering fluorescence probes utilizing various design strategies, H2S caged compounds, inhibitors of physiological H2S-producing enzymes (cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine ß-synthase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase), and labeling reagents. Fluorescence probes offer particular advantages as chemical tools to study physiological functions of biomolecules, including ease of use and real-time, nondestructive visualization of biological processes in live cells and tissues.

CO is a gaseous mediator generated by HO. Our previous studies revealed that CO generated from inducible HO-1 or from constitutive HO-2 modulates function of different heme proteins or enzymes through binding to their prosthetic ferrous heme to alter their structures, regulating biological function of cells and organs. Such CO-directed target macromolecules include sGC and CBS. In the liver, CO serves as a sinusoidal dilator through its action on sGC in hepatic stellate cells, while the same gas accounts for vasoconstrictor that inhibits H2S generated by CO-sensitive CBS in astrocytes. Since molecular O2 is a substrate for HO, the latter mechanism contributes to hypoxic vasodilation in neurovascular units. We have recently uncovered that stress-inducible CO in and around cancer cells suppresses CBS to result in decreased methylation of PFKFB3, the enzyme regulating PFK-1, leading to a shift of glucose biotransformation from glycolysis toward pentose phosphate pathway; such a metabolic remodeling causes chemoresistance through increasing NADPH and reduced glutathione under stress conditions for cancer cells. This article reviews the intriguing networks of CO-sensitive metabolic regulatory mechanisms in microcirculation and cancer.

Elevated lipid metabolism is implicated in poor survival in ovarian cancer (OC) and other cancers; however, current lipogenesis-targeting strategies lack cancer cell specificity. Here, we identify a novel role of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a sulphur amino acid metabolizing enzyme highly expressed in several ovarian cancer cell lines, in driving deregulated lipid metabolism in OC. We examined the role of CBS in regulation of triglycerides, cholesterol and lipogenic enzymes via the lipogenic transcription factors SREBP1 and SREBP2. CBS silencing attenuated the expression of number of key enzymes involved in lipid synthesis (FASN and ACC1). Additionally CBS abrogates lipid uptake in OC cells. Gene silencing of CBS or SREBPs abrogated cellular migration and invasion in OC, while ectopic expression of SREBPs can rescue phenotypic effects of CBS silencing by restoring cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, CBS represses SREBP1 and SREBP2 at the transcription levels by modulating the transcription factor Sp1. We further established the roles of both CBS and SREBPs in regulating ovarian tumor growth in vivo. In orthotopic tumor models, CBS or SREBP silencing resulted in reduced tumor cells proliferation, blood vessels formation and lipid content. Hence, cancer-selective disruption of the lipid metabolism pathway is possible by targeting CBS and, at least for OC, promises a profound benefit.

INTRODUCTION: Resveratrol (RVT) found in red wine protects against erectile dysfunction and relaxes penile tissue (corpus cavernosum) via a nitric oxide (NO) independent pathway. However, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a potent vasodilator and neuromodulator generated in corpus cavernosum.AIMS: We investigated whether RVT caused the relaxation of mice corpus cavernosum (MCC) through H2 S.METHODS: H2 S formation is measured by methylene blue assay and vascular reactivity experiments have been performed by DMT strip myograph in CD1 MCC strips.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N<U+03C9>-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 0.1<U+2009>mM) or H2 S inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA, 2<U+2009>mM) which inhibits both cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) enzyme or combination of AOAA with PAG (CSE inhibitor) has been used in the presence/absence of RVT (0.1<U+2009>mM, 30<U+2009>min) to elucidate the role of NO or H2 S pathways on the effects of RVT in MCC. Concentration-dependent relaxations to RVT, L-cysteine, sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) and acetylcholine (ACh) were studied.RESULTS: Exposure of murine corpus cavernosum to RVT increased both basal and L-cysteine-stimulated H2 S formation. Both of these effects were reversed by AOAA but not by L-NNA. RVT caused concentration-dependent relaxation of MCC and that RVT-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG but not by L-NNA. L-cysteine caused concentration-dependent relaxations, which are inhibited by AOAA or AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG significantly. Incubation of MCC with RVT significantly increased L-cysteine-induced relaxation, and this effect was inhibited by AOAA<U+2009>+<U+2009>PAG. However, RVT did not alter the effect of exogenous H2 S (NaHS) or ACh-induced relaxations.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that RVT-induced relaxation is at least partly dependent on H2 S formation and acts independent of eNOS pathway. In phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) nonresponder population, combination therapy with RVT may reverse erectile dysfunction via stimulating endogenous H2 S formation.

Deficiencies of the human cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) enzyme are characterized by a plethora of vascular disorders and hyperhomocysteinemia. However, several clinical trials demonstrated that despite reduction in homocysteine levels, disease outcome remained unaffected, thus the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is poorly defined. Here, we show that the loss of CBS function in endothelial cells (ECs) leads to a significant down-regulation of cellular hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by 50% and of glutathione (GSH) by 40%. Silencing CBS in ECs compromised phenotypic and signaling responses to the VEGF that were potentiated by decreased transcription of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and neuropilin (NRP)-1, the primary receptors regulating endothelial function. Transcriptional down-regulation of VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 was mediated by a lack in stability of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which is a sulfhydration target of H2S at residues Cys68 and Cys755. Reinstating H2S but not GSH in CBS-silenced ECs restored Sp1 levels and its binding to the VEGFR-2 promoter and VEGFR-2, NRP-1 expression, VEGF-dependent proliferation, and migration phenotypes. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of CBS-mediated protein S-sulfhydration in maintaining vascular health and function.-Saha, S., Chakraborty, P. K., Xiong, X., Dwivedi, S. K. D., Mustafi, S.

Vascular bed calcification is a common feature of ends stage renal disease that may lead to a complication in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular beds, which is a promoting cause of myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia and aneurysms. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) due to its multiple properties such as antioxidant and calcium chelation has been reported to prevent vascular calcification in uremic rats, without mentioning its impact on cerebral function. Moreover, the previous studies have not explored the effect of STS on the mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the main pathophysiological features associated with the disease and the main site for STS metabolism. The present study addresses this limitation by using a rat model where 0.75% adenine was administered to induce vascular calcification and 400 mg/kg b wt. of STS was given as preventive and curative agent. The blood and urine chemistries along with histopathology of aorta confirms the renal protective effect of STS in two modes of administration. The brain oxidative stress assessment was made through TBARS level, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, found to be in the near normal level. STS administration not only reduced the mitochondrial oxidative stress (measured by TBARS, SOD, GPx and CAT) but also preserved the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities (NADH dehydrogenase, Succinate dehydrogenase and Malate dehydrogenase) and its physiology (measured by P/O ratio and RCR). In fact, the protective effect of STS was prominent, when it was administered as a curative agent, where low H2S and high thiosulfate level was observed along with low cystathionine ß synthase activity, confirms thiosulfate mediated renal protection. In conclusion, STS when given after induction of calcification is protective to the brain by preserving its mitochondria, compared to the treatment given concomitantly.

In addition to its role in the endogenous synthesis of cysteine, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) is a major physiological source of the vasorelaxant hydrogen sulfide. Cgl null mice are potentially useful for studying the influence of this compound upon vascular tone and endothelial function. Here, we confirm a previous report that female Cgl null mice exhibit an approximate 45-fold increase in plasma total homocysteine compared to wild type controls. This level of homocysteine is approximately 3.5-fold higher than that observed in male Cgl null mice and is essentially equivalent to that observed in mouse models of cystathionine beta synthase deficient homocystinuria. Cgl null mice of both sexes exhibited decreased expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase compared to WT controls. Female Cgl null mice exhibited a sex-specific induction of betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase and methionine adenosyltransferase 1, alpha and a 70% decrease in methionine synthase expression accompanied by significantly decreased plasma methionine. Decreased plasma cysteine levels in female Cgl null mice were associated with sex-specific dysregulation of cysteine dioxygenase expression. Comparative histological assessment between cystathionine beta-synthase and Cgl null mice indicated that the therapeutic potential of cystathionine against liver injury merits possible further investigation. Collectively, our data demonstrates the importance of considering sex when investigating mouse models of inborn errors of metabolism and indicate that while female Cgl null mice are of questionable utility for studying the physiological role of hydrogen sulfide, they could serve as a useful model for studying the consequences of methionine synthase deficiency and the methylfolate trap.

The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is emerging as a mediator of lung physiology and disease. Recent studies revealed that H2S administration limited perturbations to lung structure in experimental animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), partially restoring alveolarization, limiting pulmonary hypertension, limiting inflammation, and promoting epithelial repair. No studies have addressed roles for endogenous H2S in lung development. H2S is endogenously generated by cystathionine ß-synthase (Cbs) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (Cth). We demonstrate here that the expression of Cbs and Cth in mouse lungs is dynamically regulated during lung alveolarization and that alveolarization is blunted in Cbs(-/-) and Cth(-/-) mouse pups, where a 50% reduction in the total number of alveoli was observed, without any impact on septal thickness. Laser-capture microdissection and immunofluorescence staining indicated that Cbs and Cth were expressed in the airway epithelium and lung vessels. Loss of Cbs and Cth led to a 100-500% increase in the muscularization of small- and medium-sized lung vessels, which was accompanied by increased vessel wall thickness, and an apparent decrease in lung vascular supply. Ablation of Cbs expression using small interfering RNA or pharmacological inhibition of Cth using propargylglycine in lung endothelial cells limited angiogenic capacity, causing a 30-40% decrease in tube length and a 50% decrease in number of tubes formed. In contrast, exogenous administration of H2S with GYY4137 promoted endothelial tube formation. These data confirm a key role for the H2S-generating enzymes Cbs and Cth in pulmonary vascular development and homeostasis and in lung alveolarization.

Objective Homocystinuria is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism caused by cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency that affects methionine metabolism. The clinical features are heterogeneous ranging from mental retardation, ectopia lentis, and osteoporosis to vascular events such as deep vein thrombosis, sagital sinus thrombosis, and myocardial infarction. Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CVST) is an unusual disorder in children and requires prompt and accurate management. Some causal factors for the development of CVST differ between children and adults. The majority of cases with CSVT are found to have an underlying cause for thrombosis like dehydration, infections, prothrombotic and hematologic disorders, malignancy and trauma. Although homocystinuria is usually associated with ischemic strokes, CVST as initial clinical presentation of homocystinuria is rare in children. In this article, we presented a 10-year old boy with seizure, hemiparesis, and ataxia due to CSVT caused by homocystinuria.

Our previous study has demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) attenuates neuronal injury induced by vascular dementia (VD) in rats, but the mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the neuroprotection of H2S was associated with synaptic plasticity and try to interpret the potential underlying mechanisms. Adult male Wistar rats were suffered the ligation of bilateral common carotid arteries. At 24 h after surgery, rats were administered intraperitoneally with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, 5.6 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)), a H2S donor, for 3 weeks in the VD+NaHS group and treated intraperitoneally with saline in the VD group respectively. Our results demonstrated that NaHS significantly decreased the level of glutamate. It obviously ameliorated cognitive flexibility as well as the spatial learning and memory abilities by Morris water maze. Moreover, NaHS significantly improved the long-term depression (LTD), and was able to elevate the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A, which plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, NaHS decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, and it could maintain the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK-3ß). Surprisingly, NaHS triggered the canonical Notch pathway by increasing expressions of Jagged-1 and Hes-1. These findings suggest that NaHS prevents synaptic plasticity from VD-induced damage partly via Akt/GSK-3ß pathway and Notch signaling pathway.Hydrogen sulfide modulated the ratio of NMDAR 2A/2B and improved the synaptic plasticity via Akt/GSK-3ß pathway and Notch signaling pathway in VD rats.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as a signaling molecule as well as a cytoprotective molecule. H2S modulates neurotransmission, regulates vascular tone, protects various tissues and organs, regulates inflammation, induces angiogenesis, and detects cellular oxygen levels. H2S is produced from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) together with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). Recently, a novel pathway for the production of H2S from D-cysteine was identified, involving D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) together with 3MST. Sulfuration (also called sulfhydration), which adds sulfur atoms to the cysteine residues of target proteins to modify protein activity, has been extensively studied as a mode of H2S action. Recently, hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn, where n=3-7; n=2 is termed as persulfide) have been found to sulfurate target proteins in the brain, including transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), much more potently than H2S. The physiological stimuli that trigger the production of H2S and polysulfides, and the mechanisms maintaining their local levels, remain unknown. Understanding the regulation of H2Sn (including H2S) production, and the specific stimuli that induce their release, will provide new insight into the biology of H2S and will provide novel avenues for therapeutic development in diseases involving H2S-related substances.

Increasing studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the potential application value of H2S in the therapy of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is still not well known. This study was to investigate the potential effect of H2S on early brain injury (EBI) induced by SAH and explore the underlying mechanisms. The role of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor of H2S, in SAH-induced EBI, was investigated in both in vivo and in vitro. A prechiasmatic cistern single injection model was used to produce experimental SAH in vivo. In vitro, cultured primary rat cortical neurons and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to OxyHb at concentration of 10 µM to mimic SAH. Endogenous production of H2S in the brain was significantly inhibited by SAH. The protein levels of the predominant H2S-generating enzymes in the brain, including cystathionineb-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST), were also correspondingly reduced by SAH, while treatment with NaHS restored H2S production and the expressions of CBS and 3MST. More importantly, NaHS treatment could significantly attenuate EBI (including brain edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, brain cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, and cerebral vasospasm) after SAH. In vitro, H2S protects neurons and endothelial function by functioning as an antioxidant and antiapoptotic mediator. Our results suggest that NaSH as an exogenous H2S donor could significantly reduce EBI induced by SAH.

Placental soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) release is increased in preeclampsia, which might be associated with increased shedding of Flt-1 through a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Here, we explored whether ADAM10 expression is regulated by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in placenta. Pro- and active-ADAM10 expression were significantly increased in preeclamptic placentas and inversely correlated to H2S production enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase expression. H2S significantly suppressed pro- and active-ADAM10 expression whilst inhibited sFlt-1 release. Knockdown of ADAM10 caused a decrease in sFlt-1 release. Our data suggest that dysregulation of H2S production may contribute to excessive Flt-1shedding in preeclampsia.

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (Hcy) level is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). During transsulfuration pathways, Hcy is metabolized into hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is a synaptic modulator, as well as a neuro-protective agent. However, the role of hydrogen sulfide, as well as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation, in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and synaptic dysfunction, leading to AD pathology is not clear. Therefore, we hypothesized that the inhibition of neuronal NMDA-R by H2S and MK801 mitigate the Hcy-induced BBB disruption and synapse dysfunction, in part by decreasing neuronal matrix degradation. Hcy intracerebral (IC) treatment significantly impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral circulation and memory function. Hcy treatment also decreases the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in the brain along with increased expression of NMDA-R (NR1) and synaptosomal Ca(2+) indicating excitotoxicity. Additionally, we found that Hcy treatment increased protein and mRNA expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 and also increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in the brain. The increased expression of ICAM-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and claudin-5 indicates BBB disruption and vascular inflammation. Moreover, we also found decreased expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP-97), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), synaptophysin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) showing synapse dysfunction in the hippocampus. Furthermore, NaHS and MK801 treatment ameliorates BBB disruption, CBF, and synapse functions in the mice brain. These results demonstrate a neuro-protective effect of H2S over Hcy-induced cerebrovascular pathology through the NMDA receptor. Our present study clearly signifies the therapeutic ramifications of H2S for cerebrovascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Graphical Abstract <U+115F>.

Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are known as biological messengers; they play an important role in human organism and contribute to many physiological and pathophysiological processes. NO is produced from l-arginine by constitutive NO synthase (NOS) and inducible NOS enzymatic pathways. This gaseous mediator inhibits platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and contributes to the vessel homeostasis. NO is known as a vasodilatory molecule involved in control of the gastric blood flow (GBF) and the maintenance of gastric mucosal barrier integrity in either healthy gastric mucosa or that damaged by strong irritants. Biosynthesis of H2S in mammals depends upon two enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. This gaseous mediator, similarly to NO and carbon monoxide, is involved in neuromodulation, vascular contractility and anti-inflammatory activities. For decades, H2S has been known to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase and reduce cell energy production. Nowadays it is generally considered to act through vascular smooth muscle ATP-dependent K+ channels, interacting with intracellular transcription factors and promote sulfhydration of protein cysteine moieties within the cell, but the mechanism of potential gastroprotective and ulcer healing properties of H2S has not been fully explained. The aim of this review is to compare current results of the studies concerning the role of H2S and NO in gastric mucosa protection and outline areas that may pose new opportunities for further development of novel therapeutic targets.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a familiar toxic gas that smells of rotten eggs. After the identification of endogenous H2S in the mammalian brain two decades ago, studies of this molecule uncovered physiological roles in processes such as neuromodulation, vascular tone regulation, cytoprotection against oxidative stress, angiogenesis, anti-inflammation, and oxygen sensing. Enzymes that produce H2S, such as cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase have been studied intensively and well characterized. Polysulfides, which have a higher number of inner sulfur atoms than that in H2S, were recently identified as potential signaling molecules that can activate ion channels, transcription factors, and tumor suppressors with greater potency than that of H2S. This article focuses on our contribution to the discovery of these molecules and their metabolic pathways and mechanisms of action.

Plasma homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies. We evaluated whether selective homocysteine-lowering gene transfer beneficially affects cardiac remodeling and function in a model of pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Female C57BL/6 low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr (-/-)) cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs (+/-)) mice were fed standard chow (control mice) or a folate-depleted, methionine-enriched diet to induce hyperhomocysteinemia (diet mice). Three weeks after initiation of thisdiet, mice were intravenously injected with 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(10) viral particles of an E1E3E4-deleted hepatocyte-specific adenoviral vector expressing Cbs (AdCBS), with the same dose of control vector, or with saline buffer. TAC or sham operation was performed 2 weeks later. AdCBS gene transfer resulted in 86.4 % (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) and 84.6 % (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) lower homocysteine levels in diet sham mice and diet TAC mice, respectively. Mortality rate was significantly reduced in diet AdCBS TAC mice compared to diet TAC mice during a follow-up period of 8 weeks (hazard ratio for mortality 0.495, 95 % CI 0.249 to 0.985). Left ventricular hypertrophy (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and interstitial myocardial fibrosis (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) were strikingly lower in control TAC mice and diet AdCBS TAC mice compared to diet TAC mice. Diastolic function in diet AdCBS TAC mice was similar to that of control TAC mice and was significantly improved compared to diet TACmice. AdCBS gene transfer potently reduced oxidative stress as evidenced by a reduction of plasma TBARS and a reduction of myocardial 3-nitrotyrosine-positive area (%). In conclusion, selective homocysteine lowering potently attenuates pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy via reduced oxidative stress.</AbstractText>: Plasma homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) impairs re-endothelialization and accelerates vascular remodeling. The role of CD34(+)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2(+) progenitor cells (PCs) in vascular repair in HHcy is unknown. We studied the effect of HHcy on PCs and its role in vascular repair in severe HHcy (~150 µM), which was induced in cystathionine-ß synthase heterozygous mice fed a high-methionine diet for 8 weeks. Vascular injury was introduced by carotid air-dry endothelium denudation. CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells were examined by flow cytometry. HHcy reduced bone marrow (BM) CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells and suppressed replenishment of postinjury CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cells in peripheral blood (PB). Donor green fluorescent protein-positive PC homing to the injured vessel was reduced in HHcy after CD34(+) PCs from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice were adoptively transferred following carotid injury. CD34(+) PC transfusion partially reversed HHcy-suppressed re-endothelialization and HHcy-induced neointimal formation. Furthermore, homocysteine (Hcy) inhibited proliferation, adhesion, and migration and suppressed ß1-integrin expression and activity in human CD34(+) endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) isolated from PBs in a dose-dependent manner. A functional-activating ß1-integrin antibody rescued Hcy-suppressed adhesion and migration in CD34(+) ECFCs. In conclusion, HHcy reduces BM CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) generation and suppresses CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+) cell mobilization and homing to the injured vessel via ß1-integrin inhibition, which partially contributes to impaired re-endothelialization and vascular remodeling.

In the present study, we investigate the inhibitory effect of novel H2S donors, AP67 and AP72 on isolated bovine posterior ciliary arteries (PCAs) under conditions of tone induced by an adrenoceptor agonist. Furthermore, we examined the possible mechanisms underlying the AP67- and AP72-induced relaxations. Isolated bovine PCA were set up for measurement of isometric tension in organ baths containing oxygenated Krebs solution. The relaxant action of H2S donors was studied on phenylephrine-induced tone in the absence or presence of enzyme inhibitors for the following pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX); H2S; nitric oxide and the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel. The H2S donors, NaSH (1 nM - 10 µM), AP67 (1 nM - 10 µM) and AP72 (10 nM - 1 µM) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine-induced tone in isolated bovine PCA. While the COX inhibitor, flurbiprofen (3 µM) blocked significantly (p &lt; 0.05) the inhibitory response elicited by AP67, it had no effect on relaxations induced by NaSH and AP72. Both aminooxyacetic acid (30 µM) and propargylglycine (1 mM), enzyme inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve to AP67 and AP72. Furthermore, the KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide (300 µM) and the NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME (100 µM) significantly attenuated (p &lt; 0.05) the relaxation effect induced by AP67 and AP72 on PCA. We conclude that H2S donors can relax pre-contracted isolated bovine PCA, an effect dependent on endogenous production of H2S. The inhibitory action of only AP67 on pre-contracted PCA may involve the production of inhibitory endogenous prostanoids. Furthermore, the observed inhibitory action of H2S donors on PCA may depend on the endogenous biosynthesis of NO and by an action of KATP channels.

Estrogens dramatically dilate numerous vascular beds with the greatest response in the uterus. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent vasodilator and proangiogenic second messenger, which is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). We hypothesized that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) selectively stimulates H2S biosynthesis in uterine artery (UA) and other systemic arteries. Intact and endothelium-denuded UA, mesenteric artery (MA), and carotid artery (CA) were obtained from ovariectomized nonpregnant ewes (n = 5/group) receiving vehicle or estradiol-17ß replacement therapy (ERT). Total RNA and protein were extracted for measuring CBS and CSE, and H2S production was determined by the methylene blue assay. Paraffin-embedded UA rings were used to localize CBS and CSE proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy. ERT significantly stimulated CBS mRNA and protein without altering CSE mRNA or protein in intact and denuded UA. Quantitative immunofluorescence microscopic analyses showed CBS and CSE protein localization in endothelium and smooth muscle and confirmed that ERT stimulated CBS but not CSE protein expression in UA endothelium and smooth muscle. ERT also stimulated CBS, but not CSE, mRNA and protein expression in intact and denuded MA but not CA in ovariectomized ewes. Concomitantly, ERT stimulated UA and MA but not CA H2S production. ERT-stimulated UA H2S production was completely blocked by a specific CBS but not CSE inhibitor. Thus, ERT selectively stimulates UA and MA but not CA H2S biosynthesis by specifically up-regulating CBS expression, implicating a role of H2S in estrogen-induced vasodilation and postmenopausal women's health.

Our previous study showed that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could alleviate the cognitive deficits in vascular dementia (VD) rats associated with the improvement of synaptic plasticity. Neural oscillations are reported to interact with each other through either identical-frequency or cross-frequency coupling. This study examined whether impaired neural couplings could be alleviated by H2S in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 of VD rats and explored its possible mechanism. A VD rat model was established by two-vessel occlusion. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a kind of H2S donor, was administered intraperitoneally (5.6 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. Local field potentials were simultaneously collected in the hippocampal CA3 and CA1. The effects of NaHS on the modulation of theta-gamma coupling were evaluated by using the measurements of both phase-phase coupling and phase-amplitude coupling, while several other approaches including behavior, electrophysiology, western blot, immunofluorescence staining were also employed. The results showed that NaHS significantly prevented spatial learning and memory impairments (p &lt; 0.01). NaHS considerably alleviated the impairment of neural coupling in VD rats in an identical-frequency rhythm and between cross-frequency bands. Moreover, the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) was markedly attenuated in VD rats. NaHS elevated the expression of CBS to maintain the intrinsic balance of H2S. Interestingly, it was observed that NaHS increased the protein expression of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 2A (NMDAR2A) in VD rats. In conclusion, the data suggest that NaHS played the neuroprotective role partly via modulating the expression of NMDAR2A in order to alleviate the impairments of neural couplings in VD rats.

We investigated Mthfr expression in retina and asked whether mild hyperhomocysteinemia, due to Mthfr deficiency, alters retinal neurovascular structure and function.METHODS: Expression of Mthfr was investigated at the gene and protein level using quantitative (q) RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Mthfr+/+ and Mthfr+/- mice were subjected to comprehensive evaluation using ERG, funduscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), HPLC, and morphometric and IHC analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at 8 to 24 weeks.RESULTS: Gene and protein analyses disclosed widespread retinal expression of Mthfr. Electroretinography (ERG) revealed a significant decrease in positive scotopic threshold response in retinas of Mthfr+/- mice at 24 weeks. Fundus examination in mice from both groups was normal; FA revealed areas of focal vascular leakage in 20% of Mthfr+/- mice at 12 to 16 weeks and 60% by 24 weeks. The SD-OCT revealed a significant decrease in nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness at 24 weeks in Mthfr+/- compared to Mthfr+/+ mice. There was a 2-fold elevation in retinal hcy at 24 weeks in Mthfr+/- mice by HPLC and IHC. Morphometric analysis revealed an approximately 20% reduction in cells in the ganglion cell layer of Mthfr+/- mice at 24 weeks. The IHC indicated significantly increased GFAP labeling suggestive of Müller cell activation.CONCLUSIONS: Mildly hyperhomocysteinemic Mthfr+/- mice demonstrate reduced ganglion cell function, thinner NFL, and mild vasculopathy by 24 weeks. The retinal phenotype is similar to that of hyperhomocysteinemic mice with deficiency of cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs) reported earlier. The data support the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia may be causative in certain retinal neurovasculopathies.

Hydrogen sulfide is an endogenous gaseous mediator that plays important roles in many physiological processes in microbes, plants, and animals. This chapter focuses on the important roles of hydrogen sulfide in protecting tissues against injury, promoting the repair of damage, and downregulating the inflammatory responses. The chapter focuses largely, but not exclusively, on these roles of hydrogen sulfide in the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrogen sulfide is produced throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and it contributes to maintenance of mucosal integrity. Suppression of hydrogen sulfide synthesis renders the tissue more susceptible to injury and it impairs repair. In contrast, administration of hydrogen sulfide donors can increase resistance to injury and accelerate repair. Hydrogen sulfide synthesis is rapidly and dramatically enhanced in the gastrointestinal tract after injury is induced. These increases occur specifically at the site of tissue injury. Hydrogen sulfide also plays an important role in promoting resolution of inflammation, and restoration of normal tissue function. In recent years, these beneficial actions of hydrogen sulfide have provided the basis for development of novel hydrogen sulfide-releasing drugs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that release small amounts of hydrogen sulfide are among the most advanced of the hydrogen sulfide-based drugs. Unlike the parent drugs, these modified drugs do not cause injury in the gastrointestinal tract, and do not interfere with healing of preexisting damage. Because of the increased safety profile of these drugs, they can be used in circumstances in which the toxicity of the parent drug would normally limit their use, such as in chemoprevention of cancer.

AIM: To evaluate the effect of ginkgolide B treatment on vascular endothelial function in diabetic rats.METHODS: The study included four groups with 15 male Sprague-Dawley rats: control group; control group treated with ginkgolide B; diabetic group; and diabetic treated with ginkgolide B. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde content, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits, and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) protein expression were determined in aortic tissues. Vasoconstriction to phenylephrine (PHE) and vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were assessed in aortic rings. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were measured, as well as cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß synthetase (CBS) protein expression, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity.RESULTS: Diabetes significantly impaired PHE-induced vasoconstriction and Ach-induced vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), reduced NO bioavailability and H2S production (P&lt;0.001), SOD activity, and GPX1 protein expression (P&lt;0.001), and increased malondialdehyde content and NADPH oxidase subunits, and CSE and CBS protein expression (P&lt;0.001). Ginkgolide B treatment improved PHE vasoconstriction and Ach vasorelaxation (P&lt;0.001), restored SOD (P=0.005) and eNOS (P&lt;0.001) activities, H2S production (P=0.044) and decreased malondialdehyde content (P=0.014). Vasorelaxation to SNP was not signi<U+FB01>cantly different in control and diabetic rats with or without ginkgolide B treatment. Besides, ginkgolide B increased GPX1 protein expression and reduced NADPH oxidase subunits, CBS and CSE protein expression.CONCLUSION: Ginkgolide B alleviates endothelial dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and elevating NO bioavailability and H2S production in diabetic rats.

We determined the role of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and early BBB disruption following ischemic stroke. A cranial window was prepared over the left frontal, parietal and temporal cortex in mice. Transient focal cerebral Ischemia was induced by directly ligating the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for two hours. Regional vascular response and cerebral blood flow (CBF) during ischemia and reperfusion were measured in real time. Early BBB disruption was assessed by Evans Blue (EB) and sodium fluorescein (Na-F) extravasation at 3 hours of reperfusion. Topical treatment with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, an inhibitor for cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE)) and aspartate (ASP, inhibitor for cysteine aminotransferase/3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (CAT/3-MST)), but not O-(Carboxymethyl)hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (CHH, an inhibitor for cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)), abolished postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and prevented EB and Na-F extravasation. CSE knockout (CSE-/-) reduced postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia but only inhibited Na-F extravasation. An upregulated CBS was found in cerebral cortex of CSE-/- mice. Topical treatment with CHH didn't further alter postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia, but prevented EB extravasation in CSE-/- mice. In addition, L-cysteine-induced hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production similarly increased in ischemic side cerebral cortex of control and CSE-/- mice. Our findings suggest that endogenous production of H2S by CSE and CAT/3-MST during reperfusion may be involved in postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and play an important role in early BBB disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia.

Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is known to be produced endogenously in ocular tissues with the highest levels in the retina and cornea. However, it is yet unclear whether it can modulate retinal arterial tone. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness and the mechanism of the action of H2S in the isolated bovine retinal arteries. For this purpose, the probable vasorelaxant and inhibitory effects of H2S on vascular reactivity were tested comparatively in the retinal arteries by using the donor, sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS). Thereafter, in relation to the mechanism of action of H2S, the role of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelial vasodilators of cyclooxygenase pathway as well as ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), voltage-dependent potassium channel (Kv), calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa(++)), inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir), L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel and adenylate cyclase pathway were evaluated. NaHS (1µM-3mM) displayed prominent relaxations over the concentrations of 300 µM in both PGF2a and K(+) precontracted retinal arteries. Comparatively, in the presence of NaHS (3 mM) pretreatment, the maximum contractile responses and pEC50 values to PGF2a and K(+) were significantly reduced as well. Neither the presence of the known inhibitors of NO synthase, guanylate cyclase, cyclooxygenase, adenylate cyclase, KATP and KCa(++) type K(+) channels, and L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels nor the removal of endothelium, modified the relaxation response to NaHS in retinal arteries. However, a remarkable decrease was observed in the presence of the inhibitors of Kv or Kir type K(+) channels. In addition, administration of l-cysteine (1µM-3mM), the precursor of H2S, induced a modest relaxation response in PGF2a precontracted retinal arteries, which was significantly decreased in the presence of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid, but was unmodified in the presence of the cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) inhibitor, dl-propargylglycine or the deendothelization of retinal arteries. Our findings suggested that H2S might play a substantial role in the regulation of retinal arterial tone possibly by acting on Kv and Kir channels.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is considered the third gasotransmitter following nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the mammalian body including the brain, heart, blood vessels, liver, kidney, pancreas, lung, gastrointestinal tract and reproductive organs. H2S is formed endogenously from L-cysteine by multiple enzymes, such as cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase, cystathionine-ß-synthase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in combination with cysteine aminotransferase, and participates in a variety of biological events through a number of target molecules. Exogenous and/or endogenous H2S enhances the activity of T-type Ca(2+) channels in NG108-15 cells and isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons that abundantly express Cav3.2, and in Cav3.2-transfected HEK293 cells. Cav3.2 mediates not only the H2S-induced enhancement of pain signals in nociceptor neurons, but also neuronal differentiation characterized by neuritogenesis and functional upregulation of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in NG108-15 cells. In this review, we focus on the functional modulation by H2S of primarily Cav3.2 T-type Ca(2+) channels and the molecular mechanisms underlying the H2S-induced neuronal differentiation.

Previously we reported that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays an important role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in diabetic kidney. Induction of NMDA-R and dysregulation of connexins (Cxs) were also observed. We concluded that this was due to decreased H2S production by downregulation of CBS and CSE enzymes. However, the potential role of H2S to mitigate ECM dysregulation and renal dysfunction was not clearly understood. The present study was undertaken to determine whether H2S supplementation reduces MMP-9-induced ECM remodeling and dysfunction in diabetic kidney. Wild type (C57BL/6J), diabetic (Akita, C57BL/6J-Ins2(Akita)), MMP-9 knockout (MMP-9(-/-), M9KO) and double KO of Akita/MMP-9(-/-) (DKO) mice were treated without or with 0.005 g/l of NaHS (as a source of H2S) in drinking water for 30 days. Decreased tissue production and plasma content of H2S in Akita mice were ameliorated with H2S supplementation. Dysregulated expression of MMP-9, CBS, CSE, NMDA-R1 and Cxs-40, -43 was also normalized in Akita mice treated with H2S. In addition, increased renovascular resistive index (RI), ECM deposition, plasma creatinine, and diminished renal vascular density and cortical blood flow in Akita mice were normalized with H2S treatment. We conclude that diminished H2S production in renal tissue and plasma levels in diabetes mediates adverse renal remodeling, and H2S therapy improves renal function through MMP-9- and NMDA-R1-mediated pathway.

Homocysteine is an amino acid that is toxic to vascular endothelial cells, and plasma elevations have been associated with venous thromboembolism. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia (&gt;100 µmol/L) may result from mutations in the genes coding for enzymes in the trans-sulfuration or the folate/vitamin B12-dependent re-methylation pathways. Here, we report the case of a young woman with severe, recurrent thrombo-embolic events associated with severe hyperhomocysteinemia (111 µmol/L). We identified a homozygous mutation in the cystathionine ß -synthase gene (p.I278T) and the presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation. Family study shows segregation of elevated homocysteine in heterozygous relatives for the mutation in the cystathionine ß -synthase gene. Management consisted of anticoagulation with warfarin and supplementation with folate, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and vitamin B12. After twelve years of follow-up, plasma homocysteine levels remain in the moderate range (~20 µmol/L, reference range 8-12 µmol/L) and no further thromboembolic events were identified.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hypertension is a common clinical problem still poorly understood. The presence of GC receptor (GR) in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells suggests a direct role for GC in vasculature. In response to hemodynamic shear stress, endothelium tonically releases nitric oxide (NO), endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and prostacyclin contributing to vascular homeostasis. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been proposed as a candidate for EDHF. H2S is endogenously mainly formed from L-cysteine by the action of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). It plays many physiological roles and contributes to cardiovascular function. Here we have evaluated the role played by H2S in mesenteric arterial bed and in carotid artery harvested from rats treated with vehicle or dexamethasone (DEX; 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. During treatments systolic blood pressure was significantly increased in conscious rats. EDHF contribution was evaluated in ex-vivo by performing a concentration-response curve induced by acetylcholine (Ach) in presence of a combination of indomethacin and L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester in both vascular districts. EDHF-mediated relaxation was significantly reduced in DEX-treated group in both mesenteric bed and carotid artery. EDHF-mediated relaxation was abolished by pre-treatment with both apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of small and big calcium-dependent potassium channels respectively, or with propargylglycine, inhibitor of CSE. Western blot analysis revealed a marked reduction in CBS and CSE expression as well as H2S production in homogenates of mesenteric arterial bed and carotid artery from DEX-treated rats. In parallel, H2S plasma levels were significantly reduced in DEX group compared with vehicle. In conclusion, an impairment in EDHF/H2S signaling occurs in earlier state of GC-induced hypertension in rats suggesting that counteracting this dysfunction may be beneficial to manage DEX-associated increase in blood pressure.

Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are positively correlated with cardiovascular mortality in diabetes. However, the joint effect of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) and hyperglycemia (HG) on endothelial dysfunction (ED) and the underlying mechanisms have not been studied. Mild (22 µmol/L) and moderate (88 µmol/L) HHcy were induced in cystathionine ß-synthase wild-type (Cbs(+/+)) and heterozygous-deficient (Cbs(-/+)) mice by a high-methionine (HM) diet. HG was induced by consecutive injection of streptozotocin. We found that HG worsened HHcy and elevated Hcy levels to 53 and 173 µmol/L in Cbs(+/+) and Cbs(-/+) mice fed an HM diet, respectively. Both mild and moderate HHcy aggravated HG-impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation to acetylcholine, which was completely abolished by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. HHcy potentiated HG-induced calpain activation in aortic endothelial cells isolated from Cbs mice. Calpain inhibitors rescued HHcy- and HHcy/HG-induced ED in vivo and ex vivo. Moderate HHcy- and HG-induced µ-calpain activation was potentiated by a combination of HHcy and HG in the mouse aorta. µ-Calpain small interfering RNA (µ-calpsiRNA) prevented HHcy/HG-induced ED in the mouse aorta and calpain activation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with DL-Hcy (500 µmol/L) and d-glucose (25 mmol) for 48 h. In addition, HHcy accelerated HG-induced superoxide production as determined by dihydroethidium and 3-nitrotyrosin staining and urinary 8-isoprostane/creatinine assay. Antioxidants rescued HHcy/HG-induced ED in mouse aortas and calpain activation in cultured HAECs. Finally, HHcy potentiated HG-suppressed nitric oxide production and eNOS activity in HAECs, which were prevented by calpain inhibitors or µ-calpsiRNA. HHcy aggravated HG-increased phosphorylation of eNOS at threonine 497/495 (eNOS-pThr497/495) in the mouse aorta and HAECs. HHcy/HG-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 was reversed by µ-calpsiRNA and adenoviral transduced dominant negative protein kinase C (PKC)ß2 in HAECs. HHcy and HG induced ED, which was potentiated by the combination of HHcy and HG via µ-calpain/PKCß2 activation-induced eNOS-pThr497/495 and eNOS inactivation.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as a biological mediator with various roles such as neuromodulation, regulation of the vascular tone, cytoprotection, anti-inflammation, oxygen sensing, angiogenesis, and generation of mitochondrial energy. It is produced by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). The activity of CBS is enhanced by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and glutathionylation, while it is inhibited by nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). The activity of CSE and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), which produces the 3MST substrate 3-mercaptopyruvate (3MP), is regulated by Ca2+. H2S is oxidized to thiosulfate in mitochondria through the sequential action of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), sulfur dioxygenase, and rhodanese. The rates of the production and clearance of H2S determine its cellular concentration. Polysulfides (H2Sn) have been found to occur in the brain and activate transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels, facilitate the translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to the nucleus, and suppress the activity of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) by sulfurating (sulfhydrating) the target cysteine residues. A cross talk between H2S and NO also plays an important role in cardioprotection as well as regulation of the vascular tone. H2S, polysulfides, and their cross talk with NO may mediate various physiological and pathophysiological responses.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous mediator synthesized in mammalian tissues by three main enzymes-cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate-sulfurtransferase-and its levels increase under inflammatory conditions or sepsis. Since H2S and H2S-releasing molecules afford inhibitory properties in leukocyte trafficking, we tested whether endogenous annexin A1 (AnxA1), a glucocorticoid-regulated inhibitor of inflammation acting through formylated-peptide receptor 2 (ALX), could display intermediary functions in the anti-inflammatory profile of H2S. We first investigated whether endogenous AnxA1 could modulate H2S biosynthesis. To this end, a marked increase in CBS and/or CSE gene products was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in aortas, kidneys, and spleens collected from AnxA1(-/-) mice, as compared with wild-type animals. When lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages were studied, H2S-donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) counteracted the increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 mRNA evoked by the endotoxin, yet it was inactive in macrophages harvested from AnxA1(-/-) mice. Next we studied the effect of in vivo administration of NaHS in a model of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß)-induced mesenteric inflammation. AnxA1(+/+) mice treated with NaHS (100 µmol/kg) displayed inhibition of IL-1ß-induced leukocyte adhesion/emigration in the inflamed microcirculation, not observed in AnxA1(-/-) animals. These results were translated by testing human neutrophils, where NaHS (10-100 µM) prompted an intense mobilization (&gt;50%) of AnxA1 from cytosol to cell surface, an event associated with inhibition of cell/endothelium interaction under flow. Taken together, these data strongly indicate the existence of a positive interlink between AnxA1 and H2S pathway, with nonredundant functions in the control of experimental inflammation.

Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is prevalent in humans and is implicated in neurovascular diseases, including recently in certain retinal diseases. Herein, we used hyperhomocysteinemic mice deficient in the Cbs gene encoding cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs(+/-)) to evaluate retinal vascular integrity. The Cbs(+/+) (wild type) and Cbs(+/-) (heterozygous) mice (aged 16 to 52 weeks) were subjected to fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography to assess vasculature in vivo. Retinas harvested for cryosectioning or flat mount preparations were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to detect blood vessels (isolectin-B4), angiogenesis [anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-CD105], gliosis [anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)], pericytes (anti-neural/glial antigen 2), blood-retinal barrier [anti-zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) and anti-occludin], and hypoxia [anti-pimonidazole hydrochloride (Hypoxyprobe-1)]. Levels of VEGF, GFAP, ZO-1, and occludin were determined by immunoblotting. Results of these analyses showed a mild vascular phenotype in young mice, which progressed with age. Fluorescein angiography revealed progressive neovascularization and vascular leakage in Cbs(+/-) mice; optical coherence tomography confirmed new vessels in the vitreous by 1 year. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated vascular patterns consistent with ischemia, including a capillary-free zone centrally and new vessels with capillary tufts midperipherally in older mice. This was associated with increased VEGF, CD105, and GFAP and decreased ZO-1/occludin levels in the Cbs(+/-) retinas. Retinal vein occlusion was observed in some Cbs(+/-) mouse retinas. We conclude that mild to moderate elevation of homocysteine in Cbs(+/-) mice is accompanied by progressive alterations in retinal vasculature characterized by ischemia, neovascularization, incompetent blood-retinal barrier, and vascular occlusion.

High level of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia, HHcy) is associated with increased risk for vascular disease. Evidence for this emerges from epidemiological studies which show that HHcy is associated with premature peripheral, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease independent of other risk factors. Possible mechanisms by which homocysteine causes vascular injury include endothelial injury, DNA dysfunction, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, increased oxidative stress, reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase and promoting inflammation. HHcy has been shown to cause direct damage to endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, this manifests as impaired flow-mediated vasodilation and is mainly due to a reduction in nitric oxide synthesis and bioavailability. The effect of impaired nitric oxide release can in turn trigger and potentiate atherothrombogenesis and oxidative stress. Endothelial damage is a crucial aspect of atherosclerosis and precedes overt manifestation of disease. In addition, endothelial dysfunction is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, ischemia reperfusion injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Homocysteine is a precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is formed by transulfuration process catalyzed by the enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. H2S is a gasotransmitter that has emerged recently as a novel mediator in cardiovascular homeostasis. As a potent vasodilator, it plays several roles which include regulation of vessel diameter, protection of endothelium from redox stress, ischemia reperfusion injury and chronic inflammation. However, the precise mechanism by which it mediates these beneficial effects is complex and still remains unclear. Current evidence indicates H2S modulates cellular functions by a variety of intracellular signaling processes. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of HHcy-induced endothelial dysfunction and the metabolism and physiological functions of H2S as a protective agent.

This study investigated the role and mechanism of Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) on vascular remodeling in mice. We assessed the effect of HHcy on vascular remodeling using a carotid arterial vein patch model in mice with the gene deletion of cystathionine-beta-synthase (Cbs). Vein grafts were harvested 4 weeks after surgery. Cross sections were analyzed using Verhoeff-van Gieson staining, Masson`s Trichrome staining, and immunostaining for morphological analysis and protein level assessment. The effect of Hcy on collagen secretion was examined in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). We found that Cbs-/- mice with severe HHcy exhibited thicker neointima and a higher percentage of luminal narrowing in vein grafts. In addition, severe HHcy increased elastin and collagen deposition in the neointima. Further, severe HHcy increases CD45 positive cells and proliferative cells in vein grafts. Finally, Hcy increases collagen secretion in RASMC. These results demonstrate that HHcy increases neointima formation, elastin and collagen deposition following a carotid arterial vein patch. The capacity of Hcy to promote vascular fibrosis and inflammation may contribute to the development of vascular remodeling.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with cognitive decline and hearing loss due to vascular dysfunction. Although we have shown that HHcy-induced increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is associated with cochlear pathology in cystathionine-ß-synthase heterozygous (CBS(+/-)) mice, it is still unclear whether MMP-9 contributes to functional deficit in cognition and hearing. Therefore, we hypothesize that HHcy-induced MMP-9 activation causes vascular, cerebral and cochlear remodeling resulting in diminished cognition and hearing. Wildtype (WT), CBS(+/-), MMP-9(-/-) and CBS(+/-)/MMP-9(-/-) double knock-out (DKO) mice were genotyped and used. Doppler flowmetry of internal carotid artery (ICA) was performed for peak systolic velocity [PSV], pulsatility index [PI] and resistive index [RI]. Cognitive functions were assessed by Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) and for cochlear function Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was elicited. Peak systolic velocity, pulsatility and resistive indices of ICA were decreased in CBS(+/-) mice, indicating reduced perfusion. ABR threshold was increased and maximum ABR amplitude and NORT indices (recognition, discrimination) were decreased in CBS(+/-) mice compared to WT and MMP-9(-/-). All these parameters were attenuated in DKO mice suggesting a significant role of MMP-9 in HHcy-induced vascular, neural and cochlear pathophysiology. Regression analysis of PSV with ABR and cognitive parameters revealed significant correlation (0.44-0.58). For the first time, MMP-9 has been correlated directly to functional deficits of brain and cochlea, and found to have a significant role. Our data suggests a dual pathology of HHcy occurring due to a decrease in blood supply (vasculo-neural and vasculo-cochlear) and direct tissue remodeling.

Increased blood level of homocysteine (Hcy), called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) accompanies many cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that HHcy-enhanced cerebrovascular permeability occurs via activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and leads to an increased formation of fibrinogen-ß-amyloid (Fg-Aß) complex. Cerebrovascular permeability changes were assessed in C57BL/6J (wild type, WT), cystathionine-ß-synthase heterozygote (Cbs+/-, a genetic model of HHcy), MMP9 gene knockout (Mmp9-/-), and Cbs and Mmp9 double knockout (Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/-) mice using a dual-tracer probing method. Expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and Fg-Aß complex formation was assessed in mouse brain cryosections by immunohistochemistry. Short-term memory of mice was assessed with a novel object recognition test. The cerebrovascular permeability in Cbs+/- mice was increased via mainly the paracellular transport pathway. VE-cadherin expression was the lowest and Fg-Aß complex formation was the highest along with the diminished short-term memory in Cbs+/- mice. These effects of HHcy were ameliorated in Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/- mice. Thus, HHcy causes activation of MMP9 increasing cerebrovascular permeability by downregulation of VE-cadherin resulting in an enhanced formation of Fg-Aß complex that can be associated with loss of memory. These data may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention that can modulate HHcy-induced cerebrovascular permeability and resultant pathologies.

SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as a signaling molecule as well as a cytoprotectant. It modulates neurotransmission, regulates vascular tone, and protects various tissues and organs, including neurons, the heart, and kidneys, from oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion injury. H2S is produced from l-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase.RECENT ADVANCES: In addition to these enzymes, we recently identified a novel pathway to produce H2S from d-cysteine, which involves d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) along with 3MST. These enzymes are localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. However, some enzymes translocate to organelles under specific conditions. Moreover, H2S-derived potential signaling molecules such as polysulfides and HSNO have been identified.CRITICAL ISSUES: The physiological stimulations, which trigger the production of H2S and its derivatives and maintain their local levels, remain unclear.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Understanding the regulation of the H2S production and H2S-derived signaling molecules and the specific stimuli that induce their release will provide new insights into the biology of H2S and therapeutic development in diseases involving these substances.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a well known toxic gas that is synthesized from the amino acids: cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) by three enzymes: cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). Hydrogen sulfide, like carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule in different biological systems, including the cardiovascular system. Moreover, hydrogen sulfide plays a role in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. It modulates different elements of hemostasis (activation of blood platelet, and coagulation process) as well as proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the biological role and the therapeutic potential of H2S is not clear. This review summarizes the different functions of hydrogen sulfide in hemostasis.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is prevalent in patients with hypertension and is an independent risk factor for aortic pathologies. HHcy is known to cause an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), leading to the accumulation of collagen in the aorta and resulting in stiffness and development of hypertension. Although the exact mechanism of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is unclear, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic regulation involving DNA methylation. Our purpose was to investigate whether 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) inhibitor, reduces high blood pressure (BP) by regulating aortic ECM remodeling in HHcy. Wild-type and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)(+/-) HHcy mice were treated with Aza (0.5 mg/kg body weight). In HHcy mice, Aza treatment normalized the plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and BP. Thoracic and abdominal aorta ultrasound revealed a reduction in the resistive index and wall-to-lumen ratio. Vascular response to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside improved after Aza in HHcy mice. Histology showed a marked reduction in collagen deposition in the aorta. Aza treatment decreased the expression of DNMT1, MMP9, TIMP1, and S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) and upregulated methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). We conclude that reduction of DNA methylation by Aza in HHcy reduces adverse aortic remodeling to mitigate hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) or CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNPs) is characterized by persistent inflammation of sinonasal mucosa. No one causative factor fully explains for the pathological manifestations of CRS. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to participate in inflammatory diseases, functioning as an inflammatory mediator in various organs. We analyzed the contents and synthesis activity of H2S, the expression and distribution pattern of H2S-generating enzymes, cystathione ß-synthase (CBS), and cystathione <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in CRSwNPs and CRSsNPs. The effects of H2S on the expression of CRS-relevant cytokines and the effects of cytokines on the expression of CBS and CSE were assessed in an in vitro experiment.METHODS: The contents and synthesis activity of H2S and the expression and distribution pattern of CBS and CSE in sinus mucosa were evaluated using spectrophotometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Cultured epithelial cells were used to elucidate the effects of H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), on the expression of CRS-relevant cytokines and the effects of cytokines on H2S-generating enzymes expression.RESULTS: The contents and synthesis activity of H2S were increased in CRSwNPs and CRSsNPs. CBS and CSE were localized to the superficial epithelium and submucosal glands, but CSE was also found in vascular endothelium. NaHS induced increased expression of IL-4, IL-5, interferon <U+03B3>, and TNF-a. CBS and CSE expression in cultured cells was up-regulated by CRS-relevant cytokines.CONCLUSION: H2S levels are increased in CRS, contributing to increased production of cytokines. These results suggest that H2S may function as inflammatory mediator in CRS.

Numerous papers have been published on the role of H2S during circulatory shock. Consequently, knowledge about vascular sulfide concentrations may assume major importance, in particular in the context of &quot;acute on chronic disease&quot;, i.e., during circulatory shock in animals with pre-existing chronic disease. This review addresses the questions (i) of the &quot;real&quot; sulfide levels during circulatory shock, and (ii) to which extent injury and pre-existing co-morbidity may affect the expression of H2S producing enzymes under these conditions. In the literature there is a huge range on sulfide blood levels during circulatory shock, in part as a result of the different analytical methods used, but also due to the variable of the models and species studied. Clearly, some of the very high levels reported should be questioned in the context of the well-known H2S toxicity. As long as &quot;real&quot; sulfide levels during circulatory shock are unknown and/or undetectable &quot;on line&quot; due to the lack of appropriate techniques, it appears to be premature to correlate the measured blood levels of hydrogen sulfide with the severity of shock or the H2S therapy-related biological outcomes. The available data on the tissue expression of the H2S-releasing enzymes during circulatory shock suggest that a &quot;constitutive&quot; CSE expression may play a crucial role of for the maintenance of organ function, at least in the kidney. The data also indicate that increased CBS and CSE expression, in particular in the lung and the liver, represents an adaptive response to stress states.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has complex effects in inflammation with both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions of this gas reported. Recent work suggests that a deficiency of H2S occurs in, and may contribute to, the chronic inflammation which underpins ongoing atherosclerotic disease. However, whether a high fat diet, predisposing to atherosclerosis, affects H2S metabolism is not known. In this study we assessed H2S metabolism in different tissues of mice fed a high fat diet for up to 16 weeks. Ex vivo biosynthesis of H2S was reduced in liver, kidney and lung of high fat fed mice. Western blotting revealed deficiency of cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) in liver and lung with increased expression of cystathionine ß synthetase (CBS) in liver and kidney. Expression of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) was reduced in liver but not other tissues. Aortic endothelial cell CSE was also reduced in high fat fed animals as determined immunohistochemically. Plasma H2S concentration was not changed in these animals. No evidence of lipid deposition was apparent in aortae from high fat fed animals and plasma serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also unchanged suggesting lack of frank atherosclerotic disease. Plasma IL-6, IL12p40 and G-CSF levels were increased by high fat feeding whilst other cytokines including IL-1a, IL-1b and TNF-a were not altered. These results suggest that deficiency of tissue CSE and H2S occurs in mice fed a high fat diet and that this change takes place prior to development of frank atherosclerotic disease.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with elderly frailty, skeletal muscle injury and malfunction, reduced vascular integrity and function, and mortality. Although HHcy has been implicated in the impairment of angiogenesis after hindlimb ischemia in murine models, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We hypothesized that HHcy compromises skeletal muscle perfusion, collateral formation, and arteriogenesis by diminishing postischemic vasculogenic responses in muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we created femoral artery ligation in wild-type and heterozygous cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS(+/-)) mice (a model for HHcy) and assessed tissue perfusion, collateral vessel formation, and skeletal muscle function using laser-Doppler perfusion imaging, barium angiography, and fatigue tests. In addition, we assessed postischemic levels of VEGF and levels of its muscle-specific regulators: hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator (PGC)-1a. The observations indicated dysregulation of VEGF, HIF-1a, and PGC-1a levels in ischemic skeletal muscles of CBS(+/-) mice. Concomitant with the reduced ischemic angiogenic responses, we also observed diminished leptin expression and attenuated Akt signaling in ischemic muscle fibers of CBS(+/-) mice. Moreover, there was enhanced atrogene, ubiquitin ligases that conjugate proteins for degradation during muscle atrophy, transcription, and reduced muscle function after ischemia in CBS(+/-) mice. These results suggest that HHcy adversely affects muscle-specific ischemic responses and contributes to muscle frailty.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expressions of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) in the corpus cavernosum of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.METHODS: This study included 10 male SHRs and 10 healthy male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls, all aged 12 weeks. We applied a series of electric stimuli to the major pelvic ganglions of the rats, observed changes in the ratio of intracavernosal to mean arterial blood pressure (ICP/MAP), measured the levels of serum testosterone (T) and endogenous H2S, and determined the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: No obvious difference was found in the serum T level between the two groups. Compared with the WKY rats, the SHRs showed significant reduction in the ICP/MAP ratio, the contents of plasma H2S ([21.92 +/- 2.75] micromol/L vs [10.49 +/- 1.35] micromol/L, P &lt; 0.05) and endogenous corpus cavernosal H2S ([87.67 +/- 2.12] nmol/mg prot vs [52.60 +/- 3.44] nmol/mg prot, P &lt; 0.05), the level of endogenous H2S synthesis ([4.35 +/- 0.32] nmol/mg per min vs [1.14 +/- 0.07] nmol/mg per min, P &lt; 0.05) and the expressions of CBS and CSE (P &lt; 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that CSE and CBS were distributed mainly in the smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells of the corpus cavernosum. The ICP/MAP ratio was highly positively correlated with the expressions of CSE (r = 0.977, P &lt; 0.05) and CBS (r = 0.955, P &lt; 0.05) in the corpus cavernosal tissue.CONCLUSION: Hypertension inhibits endogenous H2S synthesis by suppressing the expressions of CSE and CBS in the corpus cavernosum, which might be related with hypertension-induced reduction of erectile function.

AIMS: Therapeutic use of sulfhydrylated inhibitor S-zofenopril has raised different hypotheses regarding the role played by its thiol group in the beneficial clinical effects exerted compared with other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Here, we investigated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) pathway as accountable for extra-beneficial effects in vascular function.METHODS AND RESULTS: Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRs) and control Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with either S-zofenopril or enalapril in vivo. Aorta and carotid were harvested and ex vivo vascular reactivity to acetylcholine (Ach) and L-cysteine (L-cys) assessed. Cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptosulfur-transferase (3MST) expression, as well as H2S levels, were evaluated in both vascular tissues. The vascular response to Ach in both carotid and aorta was impaired in SHR (~30%, P &lt; 0.001). S-zofenopril, but not enalapril, restored this response, while L-cys-induced relaxation was enhanced. CSE expression in vessels and tissue/plasma H2S levels were restored to WKY values in SHRs receiving S-zofenopril. In contrast, CBS and 3MST expression were not modified by treatments. S-zofenoprilat, an active metabolite of S-zofenopril, releases H2S in a 'cell-free' assay and it directly relaxed vessels in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.001). In vivo administration of R-zofenoprilat diasteroisomer, which does not inhibit ACE, did not modify blood pressure; nonetheless, it retained the beneficial effect on SHR vascular function as well as restored plasma/tissue H2S levels.CONCLUSION: Our findings establish that S-zofenopril improves vascular function by potentiating the H2S pathway in a model of spontaneous hypertension. This novel mechanism, unrelated to ACE inhibition and based on H2S release, could explain the beneficial effects of sulfhydrylated ACE inhibitors reported in the clinical literature.

Physiological concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have multiple protective effects in the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have implicated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a new member of vasculoprotective gasotransmitter family, behaving similarly to NO and CO. H2S has been demonstrated to inhibit multiple key aspects of atherosclerosis, including atherogenic modification of LDL, monocytes adhesion to the endothelial cells, macrophage-derived foam cell formation and inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, neointimal hyperplasia, vascular calcification, and thrombogenesis. H2S also decreases plasma homocysteine levels in experimental animal models. In the human body, H2S production is predominantly catalyzed by cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). CSE is the primary H2S-producing enzyme in the vasculature. Growing evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is associated with vascular CSE/H2S deficiency and that H2S supplementation by exogenous H2S donors (such as NaHS and GYY4137) attenuates, and H2S synthesis suppression by inhibitors (such as D, L-propargylglycine) aggravates the development of atherosclerotic plaques. However, it remains elusive whether CSE deficiency plays a causative role in atherosclerosis. A recent study (Circulation. 2013; 127: 2523-2534) demonstrates that decreased endogenous H2S production by CSE genetic deletion accelerates atherosclerosis in athero-prone ApoE-/- mice, pinpointing that endogenously produced H2S by CSE activation may be of benefit in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. This study will facilitate the development of H2S-based pharmaceuticals with therapeutic applications in atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has recently been shown to play an important role in the digestive system, but the role of endogenous H2S produced locally in the gallbladder is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether gallbladder possesses the enzymatic machinery to synthesize H2S, and whether H2S synthesis is changed in gallbladder inflammation during acute acalculous cholecystitis (AC).METHODS: Adult male guinea pigs underwent either a sham operation or common bile duct ligation (CBDL). One, two, or three days after CBDL, the animals were sacrificed separately. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of gallbladder samples were scored for inflammation. H2S production rate in gallbladder tissue from each group was determined; immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to determine expression levels of the H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in gallbladder.RESULTS: There was a progressive inflammatory response after CBDL. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that CBS and CSE were expressed in the gallbladder epithelium, muscular layer, and blood vessels and that the expression increased progressively with increasing inflammation following CBDL. The expression of CBS protein as well as the H2S-production rate was significantly increased in the animals that underwent CBDL, compared to those that underwent the sham operation.CONCLUSIONS: Both CBS and CSE are expressed in gallbladder tissues. The expression of these enzymes, as well as H2S synthesis, was up-regulated in the context of inflammation during AC.

Classical homocystinuria is the most commonly inherited disorder of sulfur metabolism, caused by the genetic alterations in human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. In this study, we present comprehensive clinical findings and the genetic basis of homocystinuria in a cohort of Turkish patients. Excluding some CBS mutations, detailed genotype-phenotype correlation for different CBS mutations has not been established in literature. We aimed to make clinical subgroups according to main clinical symptoms and discussed these data together with mutational analysis results from our patients. Totally, 16 different mutations were identified; twelve of which had already been reported, and four are novel (p.N93Y, p.L251P, p.D281V and c.829-2A&gt;T). The probands were classified into three major groups according to the clinical symptoms caused by these mutations. A psychomotor delay was the most common diagnostic symptom (n=12, 46.2% neurological presentation), followed by thromboembolic events (n=6, 23.1% vascular presentation) and lens ectopia, myopia or marfanoid features (n=5, 19.2% connective tissue presentation). Pyridoxine responsiveness was 7.7%; however, with partial responsive probands, the ratio was 53.9%. In addition, five thrombophilic nucleotide changes including MTHFR c.677 C&gt;T and c.1298 A&gt;C, Factor V c.1691 G&gt;A, Factor II c.20210 G&gt;A, and SERPINE1 4G/5G were investigated to assess their contributions to the clinical spectrum. We suggest that the effect of these polymorphisms on clinical phenotype of CBS is not very clear since the distribution of thrombophilic polymorphisms does not differ among specific groups. This study provides molecular findings of 26 Turkish probands with homocystinuria and discusses the clinical presentations and putative effects of the CBS mutations.

BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency is most often diagnosed in childhood and has a variable expressivity. The most frequent abnormalities include intellectual disability, ectopia lentis, myopia, skeletal abnormalities or thromboembolism.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of homocystinuria unraveled by cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).OBSERVATION: A 17 year old female was admitted in our department of neurology for subacute headache and presented seizures in the emergency room. Cerebral imaging revealed CVT. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia was found and led to the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to composite heterozygous mutations in the CBS gene. Further investigations disclosed lens subluxation in association with myopia, mild scoliosis and osteopenia. The patient was treated by heparin followed by warfarin, vitamin therapy and dietary methionine restriction. Total homocysteine and methionine levels became normal in a few weeks and the patient had a complete recovery.CONCLUSION: In patients with CVT, plasma total homocysteine measurement as part of the etiologic work up may reveal severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to CBS or remethylation defects that require specific treatment and management including perhaps protein-restricted diet and/or vitamin therapy for life.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a colorless gas characterized by its pungent odor of rotten eggs has been reported to elicit relaxation effects on basal and pre-contracted non-ocular smooth muscles of several mammalian species. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological actions of a H2S donor, GYY4137 on isolated bovine posterior ciliary artery after contraction with the adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine. Furthermore, we studied the underlying mechanism of inhibitory action of GYY4137 on the posterior ciliary arteries. Isolated bovine posterior ciliary arteries were mounted in oxygenated organ baths and changes in isometric tension were measured with a Grass FT03 transducer connected to a recorder using a Grass Polyview Software. The relaxant actions of GYY4137 on phenylephrine pre-contracted arteries were observed in the absence and presence of an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, flurbiprofen. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of GYY4137 were studied in the absence or presence of inhibitors/activators of biosynthetic enzymes for H2S and nitric oxide production, as well as specific ion channel blockers. In the concentration range, 100 nM to 100 µM, GYY4137 elicited a concentration-dependant relaxation of phenylephrine-induced tone in isolated posterior ciliary arteries, with IC50 value of 13.4 ± 1.9 µM (n = 6). The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen, significantly (p &lt; 0.01) enhanced the relaxation induced by GYY4137 yielding IC50 value of 0.13 ± 0.08 µM (n = 6). Both the inhibitors of cystathionine ß-synthase (aminooxyacetic acid, AOAA, 30 µM) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (propargylglycine, PAG, 1 mM) caused significant (p &lt; 0.05) rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve to GYY4137. Furthermore, the KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide (100 µM) significantly (p &lt; 0.01) attenuated the relaxant action induced by GYY4137 on bovine ciliary artery. Conversely, the activator of cystathionine ß-synthase, SAM (100 µM) and an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, L-NAME (100 µM) had no significant effect on relaxations induced by GYY4137. We conclude that the inhibitory action of GYY4137 on isolated bovine ciliary artery is dependent upon the endogenous production of both prostanoids and H2S. Furthermore, the observed vascular smooth muscle relaxation induced by GYY4137 is mediated, at least in part, by KATP channels.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and is enzymatically metabolized in mitochondria by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR). Recent studies have indicated that H2S is synthesized by CSE in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), and is responsible for the anticontractile effect of PVAT on adjacent vessels. The lipophilic statin atorvastatin increases PVAT-derived H2S by suppressing its mitochondrial oxidation; the effect that results from statin-induced depletion of ubiquinone. Experimental obesity induced by a highly palatable diet has a time-dependent effect on H2S in PVAT. Adipose tissue hypoxia suppresses H2S oxidation and increases its level in short-term obesity not associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, in long-term obesity, insulin resistance and (or) hyperinsulinemia result in the down-regulation of CSE and H2S deficiency, which is corrected by treatment with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist administered for 2 weeks increases H2S by impairing mitochondria biogenesis. This indicates that the rate of mitochondrial H2S oxidation plays an important role in the regulation of H2S level in PVAT. Up-regulation of H2S signaling in short-term obesity and (or) by elevated endocannabinoids may be a compensatory mechanism that maintains vascular tone, despite endothelial dysfunction.

Folate being an important vitamin of B Complex group in our diet plays an important role not only in the synthesis of DNA but also in the maintenance of methylation reactions in the cells. Folate metabolism is influenced by several processes especially its dietary intake and the polymorphisms of the associated genes involved. Aberrant folate metabolism, therefore, affects both methylation as well as the DNA synthesis processes, both of which have been implicated in the development of various diseases. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the processes involved in folate metabolism and consequences of deviant folate metabolism, particular emphasis is given to the polymorphic genes which have been implicated in the development of various diseases in humans, like vascular diseases, Down's syndrome, neural tube defects, psychiatric disorders and cancers.

Until recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) was exclusively viewed a toxic gas and an environmental hazard, with its toxicity primarily attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial Complex IV, resulting in a shutdown of mitochondrial electron transport and cellular ATP generation. Work over the last decade established multiple biological regulatory roles of H2 S, as an endogenous gaseous transmitter. H2 S is produced by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). In striking contrast to its inhibitory effect on Complex IV, recent studies showed that at lower concentrations, H2 S serves as a stimulator of electron transport in mammalian cells, by acting as a mitochondrial electron donor. Endogenous H2 S, produced by mitochondrially localized 3-MST, supports basal, physiological cellular bioenergetic functions; the activity of this metabolic support declines with physiological aging. In specialized conditions (calcium overload in vascular smooth muscle, colon cancer cells), CSE and CBS can also associate with the mitochondria; H2 S produced by these enzymes, serves as an endogenous stimulator of cellular bioenergetics. The current article overviews the biochemical mechanisms underlying the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of H2 S on mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics and discusses the implication of these processes for normal cellular physiology. The relevance of H2 S biology is also discussed in the context of colonic epithelial cell physiology: colonocytes are exposed to high levels of sulfide produced by enteric bacteria, and serve as a metabolic barrier to limit their entry into the mammalian host, while, at the same time, utilizing it as a metabolic 'fuel'.

Emerging work demonstrates the dual regulation of mitochondrial function by hydrogen sulfide (H2 S), including, at lower concentrations, a stimulatory effect as an electron donor, and, at higher concentrations, an inhibitory effect on cytochrome C oxidase. In the current article, we overview the pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of these processes. During cellular hypoxia/acidosis, the inhibitory effect of H2 S on complex IV is enhanced, which may shift the balance of H2 S from protective to deleterious. Several pathophysiological conditions are associated with an overproduction of H2 S (e.g. sepsis), while in other disease states H2 S levels and H2 S bioavailability are reduced and its therapeutic replacement is warranted (e.g. diabetic vascular complications). Moreover, recent studies demonstrate that colorectal cancer cells up-regulate the H2 S-producing enzyme cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), and utilize its product, H2 S, as a metabolic fuel and tumour-cell survival factor; pharmacological CBS inhibition or genetic CBS silencing suppresses cancer cell bioenergetics and suppresses cell proliferation and cell chemotaxis. In the last chapter of the current article, we overview the field of H2 S-induced therapeutic 'suspended animation', a concept in which a temporary pharmacological reduction in cell metabolism is achieved, producing a decreased oxygen demand for the experimental therapy of critical illness and/or organ transplantation.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) known as a gasotransmitter is increasingly recognized for its anti-adhesive, anti-inflammatory and vasoactive properties. Due to these properties, we analysed anti-thrombotic effects of H2S and the participation of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In individual venules of the ear of hairless SKH1-hr mice, thrombus formation was induced using a phototoxic light/dye-injury model and intravital fluorescence microscopy. Animals were treated intravenously with the H2S donor Na2S or NaCl as control. In a second setting, the NOS inhibitor L-NAME was applied intraperitoneally as a bolus 12h prior to Na2S treatment and thrombus induction. Blood and ear tissue were sampled after microscopy for assessment of plasma concentrations of soluble (s)P-selectin, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 and expression of endothelial (e)NOS and inducible (i)NOS, respectively.RESULTS: When mice were treated with Na2S, venular thrombus formation was significantly delayed versus that in animals of the NaCl-treated control group. While plasma levels of pro-thrombotic adhesion molecules were not affected by Na2S, immunohistochemistry of the vessel walls showed a significant up-regulation of eNOS and iNOS expression within the Na2S-treated group. The delay of thrombus formation in the Na2S-group was partly but significantly reverted by application of L-NAME.CONCLUSIONS: The anti-thrombotic efficacy of H2S involves the NOS-pathway and may be of preventive and therapeutic value for clinical disorders with increased risk of thrombotic events.

Accumulating evidence shows that H2S has physiological functions in various tissues and organs. It includes regulation of neuronal activity, vascular tension, a release of insulin, and protection of the heart, kidney, and brain from ischemic insult. H2S is produced by enzymes from l-cysteine; cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase. We recently discovered an additional pathway for the production of H2S from d-cysteine. d-Amino acid oxidase provides 3-mercaptopyruvate for 3MST to produce H2S. d-Cysteine protects cerebellar neurons from oxidative stress and attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury caused in the kidney more effectively than l-cysteine. This review focuses on a novel pathway for the production of H2S and its therapeutic application especially to the renal diseases.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mainly produced by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in vascular system, emerges as a novel gasotransmitter exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Alterations of CSE/H2S pathway may thus be involved in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study showed that the levels of CSE mRNA and protein expression, as well as H2S production were decreased in ox-LDL-treated macrophage. CSE overexpression reduced the ox-LDL-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) generation in Raw264.7 and primary macrophage while CSE knockdown enhanced it. Exogenous supplementation of H2S with NaHS and Na2S also decreased the production of TNF-a and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in ox-LDL-stimulated macrophage, and alleviated the adhesion of macrophage to endothelial monolayer. Cysteine, a CSE preferential substrate for H2S biosynthesis, produced similar effects on the pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, which were reversed by CSE inhibitors PAG and BCA, respectively. Moreover, NaHS and Na2S attenuated the phosphorylation and degradation of I<U+03BA>Ba and p65 nuclear translocation, as well as JNK activation caused by ox-LDL. The JNK inhibitor suppressed the NF-<U+03BA>B transcription activity in ox-LDL-treated cells. Furthermore, inhibitors of NF-<U+03BA>B (PDTC), ERK (U0126 and PD98059) and JNK (SP600125) partially blocked the suppression by ox-LDL on the CSE mRNA levels. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that ox-LDL may down-regulate the CSE/H2S pathway, which plays an anti-inflammatory role in ox-LDL-stimulated macrophage by suppressing JNK/NF-<U+03BA>B signaling. The study reveals new therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis, based on modulating CSE/H2S pathway.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism first described almost 50 years ago, which involves the accumulation of plasma homocysteine and other metabolites. Without early detection and appropriate treatment, common and sometimes lethal consequences include ocular abnormalities, osteoporosis, developmental delays, marfanoid phenotype, vascular disease, and mental retardation. Almost 50% of subjects develop a psychiatric disorder during their life, but only 2.8% present a psychiatric symptom as the initial manifestation. Among this group, psychotic disorders are infrequent. We describe the case of a 17-year-old boy presenting with a first episode psychosis and an unknown homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency, which led to a lethal outcome.

Previously, we reported that Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and gastric cancer are closely associated with increased levels of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and that Korean red ginseng significantly reduced the severity of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases by attenuating H2S generation. Because the incubation of endothelial cells with H2S has been known to enhance their angiogenic activities, we hypothesized that the amelioration of H2S-induced gastric inflammation or angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) might explain the preventive effect of Korean red ginseng on H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis. The expression of inflammatory mediators, angiogenic growth factors, and angiogenic activities in the absence or presence of Korean red ginseng extracts (KRGE) were evaluated in HUVECs stimulated with the H2S generator sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS). KRGE efficiently decreased the expression of cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, enzymes that are essential for H2S synthesis. Concomitantly, a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators, including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and several angiogenic factors, including interleukin (IL)-8, hypoxia inducible factor-1a, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinases, was observed; all of these factors are normally induced after NaHS. An in vitro angiogenesis assay demonstrated that NaHS significantly increased tube formation in endothelial cells, whereas KRGE pretreatment significantly attenuated tube formation. NaHS activated p38 and Akt, increasing the expression of angiogenic factors and the proliferation of HUVECs, whereas KRGE effectively abrogated this H2S-activated angiogenesis and the increase in inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, KRGE was able to mitigate H2S-induced angiogenesis, implying that antagonistic action against H2S-induced angiogenesis may be the mechanism underlying the gastric cancer preventive effects of KRGE in H. pylori infection.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an inherited disorder of the metabolism of methionine. Clinical manifestations include mental retardation, dislocation of the optic lens, vascular lesions, arterial and venous thromboembolism, skeletal abnormalities, and osteoporosis. Most homocystinuria patients diagnosed in adulthood have severe osteoporosis, and homocystinuria is frequently mentioned as a cause of osteoporosis. Good control of plasma homocysteine may prevent or delay some of these complications. However, the effectiveness of bone mineral density (BMD) gain or fracture prevention has not been addressed. Here, we describe changes in BMD and body composition in 5 CBS deficiency patients who were diagnosed at young age and were managed with good metabolic control. We found that the BMD of each region was within the normal range. BMD gain was adequate and the patients had no significant change in skeletal morphology.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Homocysteine levels predict heart failure incidence in prospective epidemiological studies and correlate with severity of heart failure in cross-sectional surveys. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a selective homocysteine lowering intervention beneficially affects cardiac remodelling and cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI) in a murine model of combined hypercholesterolemia and hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer strategy was evaluated in female C57BL/6 low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)<U+207B>/<U+207B> cystathionine-ß-synthase (Cbs)<U+207A>/<U+207B> deficient mice fed a hyperhomocysteinemic and high saturated fat/high cholesterol diet using an E1E3E4-deleted hepatocyte-specific adenoviral vector expressing Cbs (AdCBS). MI was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery 14 days after saline injection or gene transfer. AdCBS gene transfer resulted in a persistent more than 5-fold (p&lt;0.01) decrease of plasma homocysteine levels and significantly improved endothelial progenitor cell function. Selective homocysteine lowering enhanced infarct healing as indicated by a 21% (p&lt;0.01) reduction of infarct length at day 28 after MI and by an increased number of capillaries and increased collagen content in the infarct zone. Adverse remodelling was attenuated in AdCBS MI mice as evidenced by a 29% (p&lt;0.05) reduction of left ventricular cavity area at day 28, by an increased capillary density in the remote myocardium, and by reduced interstitial collagen. The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 19% (p&lt;0.05) and the time constant of left ventricular relaxation was reduced by 21% (p&lt;0.05) in AdCBS MI mice compared to control MI mice, indicating improved diastolic function.SIGNIFICANCE: Selective homocysteine lowering gene transfer improves infarct healing, attenuates remodelling, and significantly enhances diastolic function post-MI in female C57BL/6 Ldlr<U+207B>/<U+207B> Cbs<U+207A>/<U+207B> mice. The current study corroborates the view that hyperhomocysteinemia exerts direct effects on the myocardium and may potentiate the development of heart failure.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) causes adverse remodeling, whereas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) rescues organs in vascular diseases. The involvement of MMP-9 and H2S in diabetic renovascular remodeling is, however, not well characterized. We determined whether MMP-9 regulates H2S generation and whether H2S modulates connexin through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)-mediated pathway in the diabetic kidney. Wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J), diabetic (Akita, C57BL/6J-Ins2(Akita)), MMP-9(-/-) (M9KO), double knockout (DKO) of Akita/MMP-9(-/-) mice and in vitro cell culture were used in our study. Hyperglycemic Akita mice exhibited increased level of MMP-9 and decreased production of H2S. H2S-synthesizing enzymes cystathionine-ß-synthase and cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase were also diminished. In addition, increased expressions of NMDA-R1 and connexin-40 and -43 were observed in diabetic kidney. As expected, MMP-9 mRNA was not detected in M9KO kidneys. However, very thin protein expression and activity were detected. No other changes were noticed in M9KO kidney. In DKO mice, all the above molecules showed a trend toward baseline despite hyperglycemia. In vitro, glomerular endothelial cells treated with high glucose showed induction of MMP-9, attenuated H2S production, NMDA-R1 induction, and dysregulated conexin-40 and -43 expressions. Silencing MMP-9 by siRNA or inhibition of NMDA-R1 by MK801 or H2S treatment preserved connexin-40 and -43. We conclude that in diabetic renovascular remodeling MMP-9 plays a major role and that H2S has therapeutic potential to prevent adverse diabetic renal remodeling.

SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by the desulfuration of cysteine or homocysteine, functions as a signaling molecule in an array of physiological processes including regulation of vascular tone, the cellular stress response, apoptosis, and inflammation.RECENT ADVANCES: The low steady-state levels of H2S in mammalian cells have been recently shown to reflect a balance between its synthesis and its clearance. The subversion of enzymes in the cytoplasmic trans-sulfuration pathway for producing H2S from cysteine and/or homocysteine versus producing cysteine from homocysteine, presents an interesting regulatory problem.CRITICAL ISSUES: It is not known under what conditions the enzymes operate in the canonical trans-sulfuration pathway and how their specificity is switched to catalyze the alternative H2S-producing reactions. Similarly, it is not known if and whether the mitochondrial enzymes, which oxidize sulfide and persulfide (or sulfane sulfur), are regulated to increase or decrease H2S or sulfane-sulfur pools.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: In this review, we focus on the enzymology of H2S homeostasis and discuss H2S-based signaling via persulfidation and thionitrous acid.

SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as a physiological mediator with a variety of functions. It regulates synaptic transmission, vascular tone, inflammation, transcription, and angiogenesis; protects cells from oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion injury; and promotes healing of ulcers.RECENT ADVANCES: In addition to cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase along with cysteine aminotransferase was recently demonstrated to produce H2S. Even in bacteria, H2S produced by these enzymes functions as a defense against antibiotics, suggesting that the cytoprotective effect of H2S is a universal defense mechanism in organisms from bacteria to mammals.CRITICAL ISSUES: The functional form of H2S-undissociated H2S gas, dissociated HS ion, or some other form of sulfur-has not been identified.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The regulation of H2S production by three enzymes may lead to the identification of the physiological signals that are required to release H2S. The identification of the physiological functions of other forms of sulfur may also help understand the biological significance of H2S.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an important pathophysiological process in the development of many diseases. However, the mechanism responsible for the development of PH remains unknown. The objective of the study was to explore the possible impact of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on the endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) pathway in rats with PH induced by high pulmonary blood flow. Compared with sham group, the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) in the shunt group was significantly increased, along with the increased percentage of muscularized arteries and partially muscularized arteries of small pulmonary arteries. Compared with the shunt group, SPAP in the shunt+SO2 group was significantly decreased, and the percentage of muscularized pulmonary arteries was also decreased. Additionally, rats that developed PH had significantly lower levels of SO2 concentration, aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) activity, protein and mRNA expressions of AAT2 in pulmonary tissues. Administration of an SO2 donor could alleviate the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and decrease the muscularization of pulmonary arteries. At the same time, it increased the H2S production, protein expression of cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), mRNA expression of CSE, mercaptopyruvate transsulphurase (MPST) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) in the pulmonary tissue of the rats. The results suggested that endogenous SO2/AAT2 pathway and the endogenous H2S production were downregulated in rats with PH induced by high pulmonary blood flow. However, SO2 could reduce pulmonary arterial pressure and improve the pulmonary vascular pathological changes in association with upregulating endogenous H2S pathway.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a signalling molecule that belongs to the gasotransmitter family. Two major sources for endogenous enzymatic production of H2S are cystathionine ß synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE). In the present study, we examined the selectivity of commonly used pharmacological inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis towards CSE and CBS.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To address this question, human CSE or CBS enzymes were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with GSH-S-transferase. After purification, the activity of the recombinant enzymes was tested using the methylene blue method.KEY RESULTS: ß-Cyanoalanine (BCA) was more potent in inhibiting CSE than propargylglycine (PAG) (IC50 14 ± 0.2 µM vs. 40 ± 8 µM respectively). Similar to PAG, L-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) only inhibited CSE, but did so at much lower concentrations. On the other hand, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a frequently used CBS inhibitor, was more potent in inhibiting CSE compared with BCA and PAG (IC50 1.1 ± 0.1<U+2009>µM); the IC50 for AOAA for inhibiting CBS was 8.5 ± 0.7 µM. In line with our biochemical observations, relaxation to L-cysteine was blocked by AOAA in aortic rings that lacked CBS expression. Trifluoroalanine and hydroxylamine, two compounds that have also been used to block H2S biosynthesis, blocked the activity of CBS and CSE. Trifluoroalanine had a fourfold lower IC50 for CBS versus CSE, while hydroxylamine was 60-fold more selective against CSE.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In conclusion, although PAG, AVG and BCA exhibit selectivity in inhibiting CSE versus CBS, no selective pharmacological CBS inhibitor is currently available.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, characterized by high plasma homocysteine levels, is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The increased synthesis of homocysteine, a product of methionine metabolism involving B vitamins, and its slower intracellular utilization cause increased flux into the blood. Plasma homocysteine level is an important reflection of hepatic methionine metabolism and the rate of processes modified by B vitamins as well as different enzyme activity. Lowering homocysteine might offer therapeutic benefits. However, approximately 50% of hyperhomocysteinemic patients due to cystathionine-beta-synthase deficiency are biochemically responsive to pharmacological doses of B vitamins. Therefore, effective treatments to reduce homocysteine levels are needed, and gene therapy could provide a novel approach. We recently showed that hepatic expression of DYRK1A, a serine/threonine kinase, is negatively correlated with plasma homocysteine levels in cystathionine-beta-synthase deficient mice, a mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Therefore, Dyrk1a is a good candidate for gene therapy to normalize homocysteine levels. We then used an adenoviral construct designed to restrict expression of DYRK1A to hepatocytes, and found decreased plasma homocysteine levels after hepatocyte-specific Dyrk1a gene transfer in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. The elevation of pyridoxal phosphate was consistent with the increase in cystathionine-beta-synthase activity. Commensurate with the decreased plasma homocysteine levels, targeted hepatic expression of DYRK1A resulted in elevated plasma paraoxonase-1 activity and apolipoprotein A-I levels, and rescued the Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways in aorta of mice, which can prevent homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction. These results demonstrate that hepatocyte-restricted Dyrk1a gene transfer can offer a useful therapeutic targets for the development of new selective homocysteine lowering therapy.

Increased vascular impedance in the fetoplacental circulation is associated with fetal hypoxia and growth restriction. We sought to investigate the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in regulating vasomotor tone in the fetoplacental vasculature. H2S is produced endogenously by catalytic activity of cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). Immunohistochemical analysis localized CSE to smooth muscle cells encircling arteries in stem villi. Immunoreactivity was reduced in placentas from pregnancies with severe early-onset growth-restriction and preeclampsia displaying abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms compared with preeclamptic placentas with normal waveforms and controls. These findings were confirmed at the protein and mRNA levels. MicroRNA-21, which negatively regulates CSE expression, was increased in placentas with abnormal Doppler waveforms. Exposure of villus explants to hypoxia-reoxygenation significantly reduced CSE protein and mRNA and increased microRNA-21 expression. No changes were observed in cystathionine ß-synthase expression, immunolocalized principally to the trophoblast, in pathologic placentas or in vitro. Finally, perfusion of normal placentas with an H2S donor, after preconstriction with a thromboxane mimetic, resulted in dose-dependent vasorelaxation. Glibenclamide and N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester partially blocked the effect, indicating that H2S acts through ATP-sensitive K(+) channels and nitric oxide synthesis. These results demonstrate that H2S is a powerful vasodilator of the placental vasculature and that expression of CSE is reduced in placentas associated with increased vascular resistance.

We have previously reported that bradykinin relaxes the fetal ductus arteriosus via endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) when other naturally occurring relaxants (prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide) are suppressed, but the identity of the agent could not be ascertained. Here, we have examined in the mouse whether hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a relaxant of the ductus and, if so, whether it may also function as an EDHF. We found in the vessel transcripts for the H2S synthetic enzymes, cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), and the presence of these enzymes was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. CSE and CBS were distributed across the vessel wall with the former prevailing in the intimal layer. Both enzymes occurred within the endoplasmic reticulum of endothelial and muscle cells, whereas only CSE was located also in the plasma membrane. The isolated ductus contracted to inhibitors of CSE (d,l-propargylglycine, PPG) and CBS (amino-oxyacetic acid), and PPG contraction was attenuated by removal of the endothelium. EDHF-mediated bradykinin relaxation was curtailed by both PPG and amino-oxyacetic acid, whereas the relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was not affected by either treatment. The H2S donor sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) was also a potent, concentration-dependent relaxant. We conclude that the ductus is endowed with a H2S system exerting a tonic relaxation. In addition, H2S, possibly via an overriding CSE source, qualifies as an EDHF. These findings introduce a novel vasoregulatory mechanism into the ductus, with implications for antenatal patency of the vessel and its transitional adjustments at birth.

The distribution of two enzymes involved in H(2)S synthesis, cystationine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystationine <U+03B3>-liase (CSE), was studied in the walls of the internal carotid artery, order I-V branches of the middle cerebral artery basin, and intracerebral vessels of adult Wistar rats. Immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of CBS in the endothelium of small pial arteries (order IV-V branches) and intracerebral arterioles and in the capillary walls, neurons, and vascular nerves. As for CSE, in the internal carotid artery and large (order I-II) pial branches it was found mainly in the tunica media myocytes, in order III-IV vessels in myocytes and endothelium, and in smaller pial and intracerebral vessels in the endothelium. Along with enzyme-positive vessels, many pial and intracerebral arteries contained no these enzymes in the walls.

PURPOSE: Mice with moderate/severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency or absence of the cbs gene encoding cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) have marked retinal disruption, ganglion cell loss, optic nerve mitochondrial dysfunction, and ERG defects; those with mild hyperhomocysteinemia have delayed retinal morphological/functional phenotype. Excess homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases; however, it is not known whether excess homocysteine alters retinal vasculature.METHODS: Cbs(+/+), cbs(+/-), and cbs(-/-) mice (age ~3 weeks) were subjected to angiography; retinas were harvested for cryosections, flat-mount preparations, or trypsin digestion and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize vessels using isolectin-B4, to detect angiogenesis using anti-VEGF and anti-endoglin (anti-CD105) and activated glial cells (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein [anti-GFAP]) and to investigate the blood-retinal barrier using the tight junction markers zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Expression of vegf was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were treated with excess homocysteine to analyze permeability.RESULTS: Angiography revealed vascular leakage in cbs(-/-) mice; immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated vascular patterns consistent with ischemia; isolectin-B4 labeling revealed a capillary-free zone centrally and new vessels with capillary tufts midperipherally. This was associated with increased vegf mRNA and protein, CD105, and GFAP in cbs(-/-) retinas concomitant with a marked decrease in ZO-1 and occludin. Homocysteine-treated HRECs showed increased permeability.CONCLUSIONS: Severe elevation of homocysteine in cbs(-/-) mutant mice is accompanied by alterations in retinal vasculature (ischemia, neovascularization, and incompetent blood-retinal barrier). The marked disruption of retinal structure and decreased visual function reported in cbs(-/-) mice may reflect vasculopathy as well as neuropathy.

1. The aim of the study was to determine if H(2)S is involved in the development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in broilers, a condition frequently observed in a variety of cardiac and pulmonary diseases. 2. Two-week-old broilers were reared under normoxic conditions or exposed to normobaric hypoxia (6 h/day) with tissue levels of H(2)S adjusted by administering sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, 10 µmol/kg body weight/day). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular mass, plasma and tissue H(2)S levels, the expression of cystathionine-ß-synthase (CSE) and vascular remodeling were determined at 35 d of age. 3. Exposure to hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension was characterized by elevated pulmonary pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling. This was accompanied by decreased expression of CSE and decreased concentrations of plasma and tissue H(2)S. 4. Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension was significantly reduced by administration of NaHS but this protective effect was largely abolished by D, L-propargylglycerine, an inhibitor of CSE. 5. The results indicate that H(2)S is involved in the development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Supplementing NaHS or H(2)S could be a strategy for reducing hypoxia-induced hypertension in broilers.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter. Although it has been shown to elicit responses in vascular and other smooth muscle preparations, a role for endogenously produced H2S in mediating airway tone has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether H2S is produced within the airways and to determine the functional effect on airway tone.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Small peripheral airways (&lt;5 mm in diameter) from porcine lungs were set up in isolated tissue baths, pre-contracted with the muscarinic agonist carbachol, and then exposed to either the H2S donor sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), or the precursor L-cysteine. H2S production from L-cysteine or 3-mercaptopyruvate in tissue homogenates was measured by the methylene blue assay. Expression of the H2S-synthesizing enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3> lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (3-MST) were measured by Western blotting.KEY RESULTS: NaHS caused a large relaxation of the airways, which was inhibited partially by pre-contraction with KCl or exposure to tetraethylammonium, but not glibenclamide, paxilline or 4-aminopyridine. L-cysteine also caused a relaxation of the airways which was inhibited by the CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid. Tissue homogenates from airways exposed to L-cysteine or 3-mercaptopyruvate in vitro showed a significant production of H2S. Western blotting demonstrated immunoreactivity to CBS, CSE and 3-MST enzymes in the airways.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data demonstrate that H2S can be produced endogenously within porcine airways causing relaxation. The mechanism of relaxation depends, in part, on K(+) channel activity.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the third type of active endogenous gaseous signal molecule following nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). In mammalians, H2S is mainly synthesized by two proteases, cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE). H2S plays an essential function of physiological regulation in vivo, and promotes penile erection by acting on the ATP-sensitive potassium channels to relax the vascular smooth muscle as well as by the synergistic effect with testosterone and NO to relax the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM). At present, the selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor is mainly used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), but some ED patients fail to respond. Therefore, further studies on the mechanism of H2S regulating penile erection may provide a new way for the management of erectile dysfunction.

Availability of methionine is known to modulate the rate of aging in model organisms, best illustrated by the observation that dietary methionine restriction extends the lifespan of rodents. However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In eukaryotic cells, methionine can be converted to cysteine through the reverse transsulfuration pathway thereby modulating intracellular methionine availability. Whereas previous results obtained in yeast and fruit flies suggest that alterations in the reverse transsulfuration pathway modulate the rate of aging, it is not known whether this function is conserved in evolution. Here we show that depletion of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), a rate limiting enzyme in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, induces premature senescence in human endothelial cells. We found that CBS depletion induces mild mitochondrial dysfunction and increases the sensitivity of endothelial cells to homocysteine, a known inducer of endothelial cell senescence and an established risk factor for vascular disease. Our finding that CBS deficiency induces endothelial cell senescencein vitro, involving both mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility of the cells to homocysteine, suggests a new mechanism linking CBS deficiency to vascular aging and disease.

Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) has been implicated in the development of hyperhomocysteinemia (hHcys)-induced glomerular oxidative stress and injury. However, it remains unknown whether genetically engineering of ASM gene produces beneficial or detrimental action on hHcys-induced glomerular injury. The present study generated and characterized the mice lacking cystathionine ß-synthase (Cbs) and Asm mouse gene by cross breeding Cbs(+/-) and Asm(+/-) mice. Given that the homozygotes of Cbs(-/-/)Asm(-/-) mice could not survive for 3 weeks. Cbs(+/-/)Asm(+/+), Cbs(+/-/)Asm(+/-) and Cbs(+/-/)Asm(-/-) as well as their Cbs wild type littermates were used to study the role of Asm(-/-) under a background of Cbs(+/-) with hHcys. HPLC analysis revealed that plasma Hcys level was significantly elevated in Cbs heterozygous (Cbs(+/-)) mice with different copies of Asm gene compared to Cbs(+/+) mice with different Asm gene copies. Cbs(+/-/)Asm(+/+) mice had significantly increased renal Asm activity, ceramide production and O(2.)(-) level compared to Cbs(+/+)/Asm(+/+), while Cbs(+/-/)Asm(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced renal Asm activity, ceramide production and O(2.)(-) level due to increased plasma Hcys levels. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that colocalization of podocin with ceramide was much lower in Cbs(+/-/)Asm(-/-) mice compared to Cbs(+/-/)Asm(+/+) mice, which was accompanied by a reduced glomerular damage index, albuminuria and proteinuria in Cbs(+/-/)Asm(-/-) mice. Immunofluorescent analyses of the podocin, nephrin and desmin expression also illustrated less podocyte damages in the glomeruli from Cbs(+/-/)Asm(-/-) mice compared to Cbs(+/-/)Asm(+/+) mice. In in vitro studies of podocytes, hHcys-enhanced O(2.)(-) production, desmin expression, and ceramide production as well as decreases in VEGF level and podocin expression in podocytes were substantially attenuated by prior treatment with amitriptyline, an Asm inhibitor. In conclusion, Asm gene knockout or corresponding enzyme inhibition protects the podocytes and glomeruli from hHcys-induced oxidative stress and injury.

PURPOSE: Hyperhomocysteinemia is well recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of premature atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, however, may be prevented by polyphenols, potent antioxidant compounds with anti-atherogenic properties. Previously, we used cystathionine beta synthase-deficient mice [Cbs (±)] fed a high-methionine diet-a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia-to show that daily intake of a red wine polyphenolic extract, mainly comprised of catechin and epicatechin, has a beneficial effect on aortic expression of endothelial dysfunction biomarkers and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of the present study was to understand whether catechin and epicatechin, in purified forms, have anti-atherogenic effects in hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODS: Cbs (±) mice received 50 µg of catechin and/or epicatechin daily in drinking water for 1 month. Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level and aortic expression of several endothelial dysfunction biomarkers (Vcam-1, Icam-1, E-selectin, and Lox-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf-a, Il-6) were assessed.RESULTS: We found that both catechin and epicatechin had a beneficial effect on plasma homocysteine levels and endothelial dysfunction biomarker expression; however, only catechin had a beneficial effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Further, when both polyphenols were given, a beneficial effect was observed only on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.CONCLUSIONS: Catechin seems to be a more potent anti-atherogenic compound than epicatechin in hyperhomocysteinemia and should be considered as a novel therapeutic approach against endothelial dysfunction induced by this condition.

High levels of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), are associated with cerebrovascular diseases, such as vascular dementia, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. The <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and a ligand of GABA-A receptor. By inhibiting excitatory response, it may decrease complications associated with vascular dementia and stroke. Hcy specifically competes with the GABA-A receptors and acts as an excitotoxic neurotransmitter. Previously, we have shown that Hcy increases levels of NADPH oxidase and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreases levels of thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin by antagonizing the GABA-A receptor. Hcy treatment leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cerebral circulation by inducing redox stress and ROS. The hypothesis is that Hcy induces MMPs and suppresses tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs), in part, by inhibiting the GABA-A receptor. This leads to degradation of the matrix and disruption of the blood brain barrier. The brain cortex of transgenic mouse model of HHcy (cystathionine ß-synthase, CBS-/+) and GABA-A receptor null mice treated with and without muscimol (GABA-A receptor agonist) was analysed. The mRNA levels were measured by Q-RT-PCR. Levels of MMP-2, -9, -13, and TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4 were evaluated by in situ labeling and PCR-gene arrays. Pial venular permeability to fluorescence-labeled albumin was assessed with intravital fluorescence microscopy. We found that Hcy increases metalloproteinase activity and decreases TIMP-4 by antagonizing the GABA-A receptor. The results demonstrate a novel mechanism in which brain microvascular permeability changes during HHcy and vascular dementias, and have therapeutic ramifications for microvascular disease in Alzheimer's patients.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been found to play beneficial roles in ameliorating several diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiac/renal ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), the main enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway, catalyze H(2)S production in mammalian tissues. However, the distributions and precise roles of these enzymes in the kidney have not yet been identified.METHODS: The present study examined the localization of both enzymes in the normal kidney and the effect of the H(2)S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) in the renal peritubular capillary (PTC) under conditions of diabetic nephropathy, using pancreatic ß-cell-specific calmodulin-overexpressing transgenic mice as a model of diabetes.RESULTS: In the normal kidney, we detected expression of both CBS and CSE in the brush border and cytoplasm of the proximal tubules, but not in the glomeruli, distal tubules and vascular endothelial cells of renal PTCs. Administration of NaHS increased PTC diameter and blood flow. We further evaluated whether biosynthesis of H(2)S was altered in a spontaneous diabetic model that developed renal lesions similar to human diabetic nephropathy. CSE expression was markedly reduced under diabetic conditions, whereas CBS expression was unaffected. Progressive diabetic nephropathy showed vasoconstriction and a loss of blood flow in PTCs that was ameliorated by NaHS treatment.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CSE expression in the proximal tubules may also regulate tubulointerstitial microcirculation via H(2)S production. H(2)S may represent a target of treatment to prevent progression of ischemic injury in diabetic nephropathy.

Since our initial demonstrations that hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) may function as a neuromodulator in the brain and a smooth muscle relaxant in the vascular system, accumulating evidence shows that H(2)S may function as a signaling molecule. We and others also found that H(2)S has a cytoprotective effect. Because H(2)S is well-known toxic gas, a cytoprotective role has been overlooked. H(2)S protects neurons from oxidative stress. It also protects cardiac muscle from ischemia-reperfusion injury. The finding led to the application of H(2)S to the bypass surgery patients in Phase II clinical trial. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) are well known as H(2)S-producing enzymes. We recently demonstrated that the other H(2)S-producing enzyme, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) is localized to neurons in the brain and to the vascular endothelium. However, the regulation of H(2)S production by 3MST/CAT pathway had not been well understood. The present study shows that H(2)S production by 3MST/CAT pathway is regulated by Ca(2+) and that H(2)S protects retinal photoreceptor cells from light induced degeneration by suppressing excessive Ca(2+) influx caused by intense light.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently emerged as a mammalian gaseous messenger molecule, akin to nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. H(2)S is predominantly formed from Cys or its derivatives by the enzymes cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase. One of the mechanisms by which H(2)S signals is by sulfhydration of reactive Cys residues in target proteins. Although analogous to protein nitrosylation, sulfhydration is substantially more prevalent and usually increases the catalytic activity of targeted proteins. Physiological actions of sulfhydration include the regulation of inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling as well as of vascular tension.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is considered the third endogenous gas transmitter besides nitric oxide and carbon monoxide [1]. It is produced from L-cysteine or L-methionine via the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). H2S is involved in the control of vascular homeostasis, having either relaxant or contractant effect on smooth muscle cells. The H2S involvement in rat and human intrauterine tissues has also been shown [2].OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the L-cysteine/ H2S pathway in rat and human placenta in hypertensive state.METHODS: Placental samples were collected from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive rat (Wistar Kyoto; WKY). In parallel, placental samples were collected from 10 pre-eclamptic women and 5 controls after caesarean sections. Pre-eclamptic women were divided into two subgroups: Group1 (women who developed Early Preeclampsia, n=4); Group2 (women who developed Late Preeclampsia, n=6). The expression of CBS and CSE was evaluated in sample tissues by Western blotting analysis. The enzymatic activity was assessed in basal and stimulated (L- cysteine) condiction by a colorimetric assay. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test. P&lt;0,05 was considered as statistically significant.RESULTS: The expression of CBS and CSE in placenta of SHR rats were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) compared to WKY. The H2S production resulted significantly (p&lt;0,05) lower in SHR than WKY rats. In human placenta, the basal H2S production was similar in the three groups; interestingly the H2S production by adding L-cysteine, was higher in Late Preeclampsia compared to control group.CONCLUSION: H2S was produced in rat and human placenta. CBS and CSE, the enzymes involved in the production of H2S, were down-regulated in SHR rats and, as a consequence the H2S production was significantly reduced. Starting from these data, we tried to analyze the role of hydrogen sulfide in preeclampsia to assess the contribute of this gas transmitter in the development of this condition. Unexpectedly, preliminary data demonstrated that in women developing Late Preeclampsia there was an higher production of H2S after stimulation with L-cysteine, not revealed in Early Preeclampsia or in healthy control group. Our results indicated that the L-cysteine/H2S pathway could contribute to the development of preeclampsia condition.

By methods of histochemical marking of NADPH-diaphorase and immunohistochemical marking of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), the presence and distribution of NO and H2S-synthesizing elements in thoracic ganglion are shown in two crab species Eriocheir japonicus and Pugettia quadreidens. In the thoracic ganglion, NO and H2S have been established to be synthesized by different neurons. The high CBS activity in efferent elements--segmentary motoneurons, interneurons, and nerve fibers in the extremity neuropil--indicates involvement of hydrogen sulfide in organization of the crustacean motor behavior. The presence of H2S-synthesizing neurons in the wall of sternal artery in E. japonicus allows suggesting participation of H2S in regulation of vascular tonus.

RATIONALE: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) accelerates atherosclerosis and increases inflammatory monocytes (MC) in peripheral tissues. However, its causative role in atherosclerosis is not well established and its effect on vascular inflammation has not been studied. The underlying mechanism is unknown.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the causative role of HHcy in atherogenesis and its effect on inflammatory MC differentiation.METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated a novel HHcy and hyperlipidemia mouse model, in which cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) genes were deficient (Ldlr(-/-) Cbs(-/+)). Severe HHcy (plasma homocysteine (Hcy)=275 µmol/L) was induced by a high methionine diet containing sufficient basal levels of B vitamins. Plasma Hcy levels were lowered to 46 µmol/L from 244 µmol/L by vitamin supplementation, which elevated plasma folate levels. Bone marrow (BM)-derived cells were traced by the transplantation of BM cells from enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic mice after sublethal irradiation of the recipient. HHcy accelerated atherosclerosis and promoted Ly6C(high) inflammatory MC differentiation of both BM and tissue origins in the aortas and peripheral tissues. It also elevated plasma levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and MCP-1; increased vessel wall MC accumulation; and increased macrophage maturation. Hcy-lowering therapy reversed HHcy-induced lesion formation, plasma cytokine increase, and blood and vessel inflammatory MC (Ly6C(high+middle)) accumulation. Plasma Hcy levels were positively correlated with plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In primary mouse splenocytes, L-Hcy promoted rIFN<U+03B3>-induced inflammatory MC differentiation, as well as increased TNF-a, IL-6, and superoxide anion production in inflammatory MC subsets. Antioxidants and folic acid reversed L-Hcy-induced inflammatory MC differentiation and oxidative stress in inflammatory MC subsets.CONCLUSIONS: HHcy causes vessel wall inflammatory MC differentiation and macrophage maturation of both BM and tissue origins, leading to atherosclerosis via an oxidative stress-related mechanism.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been identified as a regulator of various physiological events, including vasodilation, angiogenesis, antiapoptotic, and cellular signaling. Endogenously, H(2)S is produced as a metabolite of homocysteine (Hcy) by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). Although Hcy is recognized as vascular risk factor at an elevated level [hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)] and contributes to vascular injury leading to renovascular dysfunction, the exact mechanism is unclear. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether conversion of Hcy to H(2)S improves renovascular function. Ex vivo renal artery culture with CBS, CSE, and 3MST triple gene therapy generated more H(2)S in the presence of Hcy, and these arteries were more responsive to endothelial-dependent vasodilation compared with nontransfected arteries treated with high Hcy. Cross section of triple gene-delivered renal arteries immunostaining suggested increased expression of CD31 and VEGF and diminished expression of the antiangiogenic factor endostatin. In vitro endothelial cell culture demonstrated increased mitophagy during high levels of Hcy and was mitigated by triple gene delivery. Also, dephosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated FoxO3 in HHcy were reversed by H(2)S or triple gene delivery. Upregulated matrix metalloproteinases-13 and downregulated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in HHcy were normalized by overexpression of triple genes. Together, these results suggest that H(2)S plays a key role in renovasculopathy during HHcy and is mediated through Akt/FoxO3 pathways. We conclude that conversion of Hcy to H(2)S by CBS, CSE, or 3MST triple gene therapy improves renovascular function in HHcy.

It has been recognized that gaseous molecules and their signaling cascades play a vital role in alterations of metabolic systems in physiologic and pathologic conditions. Contrary to this awareness, detailed mechanisms whereby gases exert their actions, in particular in vivo, have been unclear because of several reasons. Gaseous signaling involves diverse reactions with metal centers of metalloproteins and thiol modification of cysteine residues of proteins. Both the multiplicity of gas targets and the technical limitations in accessing local gas concentrations make dissection of exact actions of any gas mediator a challenge. However, a series of advanced technologies now offer ways to explore gas-responsive regulatory processes in vivo. Imaging mass spectrometry combined with quantitative metabolomics by capillary-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry reveals spatio-temporal profiles of many metabolites. Comparing the metabolic footprinting of murine samples with a targeted deletion of a specific gas-producing enzyme makes it possible to determine sites of actions of the gas. In this review, we intend to elaborate on the ideas how small gaseous molecules interact with metabolic systems to control organ functions such as cerebral vascular tone and energy metabolism in vivo.

Thrombophilias are defined as a predisposition to thrombosis due to hematological changes which induce blood hypercoagulability; they can be inherited or acquired. They are individually characterized by a large phenotypic variability, even when they occur within the same family. Hereditary thrombophilias are, in most cases, due to changes related to physiological coagulation inhibitors or mutations in the genes of coagulation factors. High levels of plasma homocysteine may also be responsible for vaso-occlusive episodes and may have acquired (nutritional deficiencies of folate and vitamins B6 and B12) and/or genetic causes (mutations in the genes responsible for expression of enzymes involved in the intracellular metabolism of homocysteine). Considering that: (1) thromboses are events of multigenic and multifactorial etiopathology; (2) the presence of mutations in several genes significantly increases the risk of their occurrence; (3) the vascular territory (venous and/or arterial) affected involves different pathophysiological mechanisms and treatments, knowledge of genetic variants that may contribute to the risk and variability of the phenotypic manifestations of these diseases is extremely important. This understanding may provide support for a more individualized and therefore more effective treatment for thrombophilia carriers. Thus, this mini-review aims to address a comprehensive summary of thrombophilias and thrombosis, and discuss the role of polymorphisms in Factor V (FV Leiden), Prothrombin, Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) genes as risk factors for thrombophilias.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a risk factor for vascular disease but its underlying molecular pathology is not understood. Homocysteine is metabolically linked to the epigenetic process of DNA methylation. Tissue-specific changes in DNA methylation have been observed in HHcy but little is known about vascular tissue. The objective of this study was to determine if changes in the epigenetic regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression (encoded by Nr3c1) in aorta are associated with HHcy. C57BL/6 mice heterozygous for disruption of the cystathionine-ß-synthase gene (Cbs+/-) and controls (Cbs+/+) were fed a control or high methionine/low folate (HH) diet to induce HHcy. Cbs+/- and Cbs+/+ fed the HH diet had higher plasma total homocysteine levels (19.9 ± 3.2 and 7.0 ± 0.9 µM, respectively) than Cbs+/+ mice fed the control diet (2.7 ± 0.2 µM), and this was accompanied by lower Nr3c1 mRNA and lower GR protein in aorta. The Nr3c1 gene contains multiple first exons producing heterogeneous RNA transcripts expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We identified expression of two transcripts in aorta. Bisulfite pyrosequencing found increased methylation of the promoter regions for these transcripts at sites corresponding to Sp1 and Nrf1 binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation found lower binding of Nrf1 to the Nr3c1 promoter but higher expression of Nrf1 protein in aorta from mice with HHcy. These findings show methylation and silencing of vascular Nr3c1 expression and suggest a role for epigenetic regulation of gene expression in HHcy.

In hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction due to reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide is a consistent finding. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Increased levels of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) have been associated with HHcy, and may contribute, at least in part, for the homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction, but whether cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) deficiency is associated with increased ADMA has hardly been investigated. To address this question, we measured total homocysteine (tHcy), ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in plasma of 22 adult CBS deficient patients, using established HPLC techniques. Results showed that in CBS deficient patients with elevated levels of tHcy (median (total range): 33 (14-237) µmol/L), both ADMA and SDMA levels were normal. Moreover, tHcy and ADMA concentrations were not correlated (r(s)=0.017, p=0.94). Our results favor the hypothesis that the negative vascular effects of HHcy have an ADMA-independent etiology.

Hydrogen sulphide, H(2)S, is a gaseous compound involved in a number of biological responses, e.g. blood pressure, vascular function and energy metabolism. In particular, H(2)S is able to lower blood pressure, protect from injury in models of ischaemia-reperfusion and induce a hypometabolic state. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), low plasma hydrogen sulphide levels have been established in humans and in animal models. The enzymes involved in its production are cystathionine ß-synthase, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase. The mechanisms for H(2)S decrease in CKD are related to the reduced gene expression (demonstrated in uraemic patient blood cells) and decreased protein levels (in tissues such as liver, kidney, brain in a CKD rat model). In the present Nephrol Dial Transplant issue, in fact, Aminzadeh and Vaziri document that the alterations in this pathway complicate the uraemic state and are linked to CKD progression. They furnish a time frame in CKD and record enzyme tissue distribution. It remains to be established if low H(2)S is causally linked to CKD progression and if interventions aimed to restore the status quo ante are able to modify this picture.

DDT1 MF-2 hamster ductus deferens cells are resistant to hypothermia due to serotonin secretion from secretory vesicles and subsequent cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) mediated formation of H2S. We investigated whether the mechanism promoting resistance to hypothermia may be translationally induced in cells vulnerable to cold storage. Thus, VMAT-1 (vesicular monoamino transferase) and TPH-1 (tryptophan hydroxylase) were co-transfected in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMAC) and kidney tissue to create a serotonin-vesicular phenotype (named VTSMAC and VTkidney, respectively). Effects on hypothermic damage were assessed. VTSMAC showed a vesicular phenotype and an 8-fold increase in serotonin content and 5-fold increase in its release upon cooling. Cooled VTSMAC produced up to 10 fold higher concentrations of H2S, and were protected from hypothermia, as shown by a 50% reduction of caspase 3/7 activity and 4 times higher survival compared to SMAC. Hypothermic resistance was abolished by the inhibition of CBS activity or blockade of serotonin re-uptake. In VTkidney slices, expression of CBS was 3 fold increased in cold preserved kidney tissue, with two-fold increase in H2S concentration. While cooling induced substantial damage to empty vector transfected kidney as shown by caspase 3/7 activity and loss of FABP1, VTkidney was fully protected and comparable to non-cooled control. Thus, transfection of VMAT-1 and TPH-1 induced vesicular storage of serotonin which is triggered release upon cooling and has protective effects against hypothermia. The vesicular serotonergic phenotype protects against hypothermic damage through re-uptake of serotonin inducing CBS mediated H2S production both in cells and kidney slices.

Enhancement of cerebral blood flow by hypoxia is critical for brain function, but signaling systems underlying its regulation have been unclear. We report a pathway mediating hypoxia-induced cerebral vasodilation in studies monitoring vascular disposition in cerebellar slices and in intact mouse brains using two-photon intravital laser scanning microscopy. In this cascade, hypoxia elicits cerebral vasodilation via the coordinate actions of H(2)S formed by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and CO generated by heme oxygenase (HO)-2. Hypoxia diminishes CO generation by HO-2, an oxygen sensor. The constitutive CO physiologically inhibits CBS, and hypoxia leads to increased levels of H(2)S that mediate the vasodilation of precapillary arterioles. Mice with targeted deletion of HO-2 or CBS display impaired vascular responses to hypoxia. Thus, in intact adult brain cerebral cortex of HO-2-null mice, imaging mass spectrometry reveals an impaired ability to maintain ATP levels on hypoxia.

More than 29 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with hearing loss. Interestingly, elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels, known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), are also associated with impaired hearing. However, the associated mechanism remains obscure. The collagen receptor such as discoidin domain receptor 1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) play a significant role in inner ear structure and function. We hypothesize that HHcy increases hearing thresholds by compromise in inner ear vasculature resulted from impaired Hcy metabolism, increased oxidative stress, collagen IVa and collagen Ia turnover. The treatment with folic acid (FA) protects elevated hearing thresholds and prevents reduction in vessel density by lowering abundant collagen deposition and oxidative stress in inner ear. To test this hypothesis we employed 8 weeks old male wild type (WT), cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice, WT + FA (0.0057 µg/g/day, equivalent to a 400 µg/70 kg/day human dose in drinking water); and CBS(+/-) +FA. The mice were treated for four weeks. The hearing thresholds were determined by recording the auditory brainstem responses. Integrity of vessels was analyzed by perfusion of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracer. Endothelial permeability was assessed, which indicated restoration of HRP leakage by FA treatment. A total Hcy level was increased in stria vascularis (SV) and spiral ligament (SL) of CBS+/- mice which was lowered by FA. Interestingly, FA treatment lowered Col IVa Immunostaining by affecting its turnover. The levels of MMP-2, -9, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathione gamma lyase (CSE) were measured by Western blot analysis. The oxidative stress was high in SV and SL of CBS+/- compared to WT however the treatment with FA lowered oxidative stress in CBS+/- mice. These data suggested that hearing loss in CBS+/- mice was primarily due to leakage in inner ear circulation, also partly by induced collagen imbalance, increase in Hcy and oxidative stress in inner ear.

Hyperhomocysteinemia confers a high risk for thrombotic vascular events, but homocysteine-lowering therapies have been ineffective in reducing the incidence of secondary vascular outcomes, raising questions regarding the role of homocysteine as a mediator of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, to determine the contribution of elevated homocysteine to thrombosis susceptibility, we studied Cbs(-/-) mice conditionally expressing a zinc-inducible mutated human CBS (I278T) transgene. Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice exhibited severe hyperhomocysteinemia and endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arterioles. Surprisingly, however, these mice did not display increased susceptibility to arterial or venous thrombosis as measured by photochemical injury in the carotid artery, chemical injury in the carotid artery or mesenteric arterioles, or ligation of the inferior vena cava. A survey of hemostatic and hemodynamic parameters revealed no detectible differences between control and Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice. Our data demonstrate that severe elevation in homocysteine leads to the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction but is not sufficient to promote thrombosis. These findings may provide insights into the failure of homocysteine-lowering trials in secondary prevention from thrombotic vascular events.

Accumulating evidences suggest that homocysteine, a non-protein amino acid, is involved in vessel remodeling and blood flow at elevated level, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Here we hypothesized that homocysteine affects vein in such a way that vein develops arterial phenotype. We tested our hypothesis employing wild type (WT, C57BL/6J) and CBS+/- (cystathionine ß-synthase heterozygote, a genetic model of hyperhomocysteinemia) supplemented with or without folic acid (FA, a homocysteine lowering agent). Vena cava blood flow was measured by ultrasound transonic flow probe. Tissue collagen and elastin were detected by histochemistry. Super oxide was detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Expressions of MMP-2, -9, -12, TIMP -2,-4, were measured by Western blot. MMP-13, TIMP-1, -3, and vein and aortic markers, EphB4 and EphrinB2, respectively were measured by RT-PCR. The results indicated relatively low blood flow and significant increase of collagen/elastin ratio in the CBS+/- mice compared to WT. Although FA treatment did not alter blood flow in CBS+/- mice, the collagen/elastin ratio was normalized. A relatively increased content of super oxide and gelatinase activity was observed in CBS+/- vena cava vs WT and normalized by FA treatment. Western blot analyses showed significant increase in MMP-9,-12 and decrease in TIMP-2, -4 expressions. Expressions of MMP-13, TIMP-1 and -3, Ephrin B2 were increased, whereas EphB4 was decreased with reverse change in FA treatment, with no change in MMP-13 and TIMP-1. We conclude that chronic HHcy causes vascular remodeling that expresses arterial phenotype in vein.

This review aims to investigate the role of genetic changes in the development of cardiovascular diseases [CVD]. Oxidation of Low density Lipoprotein (LDL) and mutations in LDL receptors gene are a trigger for numerous of atherogenic events. Also, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays an important role in vasodilatation of blood vessels through synthesis of nitric oxide. Three single base pair changes, 786T/C, 922A/G, and 1468T/A, have been identified in the promoter region of the eNOS gene and are associated with coronary spasm. Moreover, two distinct variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTRs) in introns 4 and 13 have been detected. The presence of a minimum of 38 CA repeats in intron 13 has been associated with an independent 2.2-fold increase in the risk of coronary artery disease [CAD]. Plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx-3) maintains the vascular bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), through depletion of reactive oxygen species. Mutation(s) or polymorphism(s) in the plasma GPx-3 gene promoter may predispose to a thrombotic disorder, and constitute a genetic risk factor for thrombotic cerebrovascular disease. Hyperhomocysteinemia is another independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia could be caused by cystathionine-ß-synthase enzyme deficiency but it could be due to homozygosity of a common 677C/T point mutation in the coding region of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene as a 3-fold increase in risk of CAD is associated with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. A second common variant in MTHFR 1298A/C is associated with decreased enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo, especially when occurring simultaneously with the 677 C/T polymorphism. Elevated fibrinogen, an essential component of the coagulation system, has been most consistently associated with arterial thrombotic disorders. Several polymorphisms (148C/T, 455G/A, and -854G/A) have been identified in the genes encoding the 3 pairs of fibrinogen polypeptide chains. The -455G/A, and -854G/A substitutions are the most physiologically relevant mutations. In addition the -455A allele has been associated with the progression of atheroma, and also with a 2.5-fold increase in risk of multiple lacunar infarcts in a cohort of elderly patients with stroke. It is concluded that genetic changes in the previously mentioned genes could play a significant role in the initiation and progression of CVD. This review provides useful information for both physicians and medical students whom are interested in human genetics which is related to cardiovascular diseases.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) was the third gaseous transmitter to be discovered, along with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, and has been proposed to be involved in numerous physiological processes and pathology of various diseases. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is characterized by multiple key events including endothelial dysfunction, monocyte infiltration and their differentiation into macrophages, conversion of lesion-resident macrophages into foam cells, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has indicated that H(2)S plays a potentially significant role in all of these biological processes and that malfunction of H(2)S homeostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Experiments have demonstrated that H(2)S supplementation ameliorated many of these atherogenic processes and hence, such supplementation potentially may prove to be of therapeutic benefit in the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis. H(2)S levels may be induced by the administration of H(2)S or H(2)S donors, or alternatively be reduced by the administration of specific cystathionine ß-synthase or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase inhibitors. However, issues remain with the potential use of currently available H(2)S-modulating agents in a clinical setting. This review will provide a description of the current literature on the involvement of H(2)S in these key aspects of vascular biology that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, as well as the therapeutic potential of currently available H(2)S-modulating agents.

The effects of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) and acute hypoxia are similar in isolated pulmonary arteries from various species. However, the involvement of H(2)S in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) has not been studied in the intact lung. The present study used an intact, isolated, perfused rat lung preparation to examine whether adding compounds essential to H(2)S synthesis or to its inhibition would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the magnitude of HPV. Western blots performed in lung tissue identified the presence of the H(2)S-synthesizing enzymes, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (3-MST), but not cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS). Adding three H(2)S synthesis precursors, cysteine and oxidized or reduced glutathione, to the perfusate significantly increased peak arterial pressure during hypoxia compared with control (P &lt; 0.05). Adding a-ketoglutarate to enhance the 3-MST enzyme pathway also resulted in an increase (P &lt; 0.05). Both aspartate, which inhibits the 3-MST synthesis pathway, and propargylglycine (PPG), which inhibits the CSE pathway, significantly reduced the increases in arterial pressure during hypoxia. Diethylmaleate (DEM), which conjugates sulfhydryls, also reduced the peak hypoxic arterial pressure at concentrations &gt;2 mM. Finally, H(2)S concentrations as measured with a specially designed polarographic electrode decreased markedly in lung tissue homogenate and in small pulmonary arteries when air was added to the hypoxic environment of the measurement chamber. The results of this study provide evidence that the rate of H(2)S synthesis plays a role in the magnitude of acute HPV in the isolated perfused rat lung.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), which is a well-known toxic gas, has recently been recognized as a biological messenger that plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Relatively high levels of H(2)S have been discovered in mammalian tissues. It is mainly synthesized by 2 enzymes, including cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lysase, which utilize L-cysteine as substrate to produce H(2)S. H(2)S has been demonstrated to exhibit potent vasodilator activity both in vitro and in vivo by relaxing vascular smooth muscle. Recently, H(2)S has been discovered in penile tissue with smooth muscle relaxant effects. Furthermore, other effects of H(2)S could play a role in the physiology of erection. Understanding H(2)S in the physiology of erection might provide alternative erectile dysfunction strategies for those patients with poor or no response to type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This review intends to present the H(2)S pathway in penile tissue and the potential role of H(2)S in the physiology of erections.

Although children born with severe homocystinurea (i.e. cystathionine beta synthase homozygote knockout, CBS-/-) develop deleterious vascular complications with structural malformation and do not live past teenage, the heterozygote (CBS-/+) lives with apparently normal phenotype. Interestingly, this differential role of CBS expression in vascular remodeling is unclear. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>) is nuclear transcription factor that mitigates vascular complications. The hypothesis was that homocysteine (Hcy) decreased thioredoxin (Trx), peroxiredoxin (Prx), increased NADPH oxidase (NOX1), mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria in a CBS gene dose-dependent manner. ROS transduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation causing thickening (fibrosis) of the basement membrane, rendering ineffective endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and promoted endothelial-smooth muscle disconnection/uncoupling by antagonizing PPAR<U+03B3>. Wild type (WT-CBS+/+), CBS-/+ and CBS -/- mice were treated with or without ciglitazone (CZ, a PPAR<U+03B3> agonist) in food at birth. Aortic nuclear PPAR<U+03B3> expression was measured by EMSA. Aortic mtNOS activity and ROS production was measured using NO- and H(2)O(2)-electrodes, respectively. Aorta was analyzed for Trx, Prx, by Western blot, and PCR. MMP activity was by in situ zymography. Aortic function was measured in tissue myobath. The results suggested 90% morbidity in CBS-/- allele at 12 wks. However, treatment with the PPAR<U+03B3> agonist, CZ significantly reduced the morbidity to 20%. In addition, CZ restored the PPAR<U+03B3> activity in CBS-/+ and -/- mice to normal levels. The oxidative stress was alleviated by CZ treatment. In situ labeling with mito-tracker suggests co-localization of ROS with mitochondrial mitophagy. The mtNOS activity was increased in HHcy compared to WT. The data support the notion that Hcy decreases redoxins, increases mtNOS activity and ROS/oxidase in mitochondrial mitophagy in a gene dose-dependent manner of CBS. ROS transduces MMP activation, rendering ineffective eNOS and promotes endothelial-smooth muscle disconnection/uncoupling by antagonizing PPAR<U+03B3>. We suggest that the children born with severe ho-mocystineurea may do better if treated with PPAR<U+03B3> agonist.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has recently been recognized as a signaling molecule as well as a cytoprotectant. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) are well-known as H(2)S-producing enzymes. We recently demonstrated that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) produces H(2)S in the brain and in vascular endothelium. However, the cellular distribution and regulation of these enzymes are not well understood. Here we show that 3MST and CAT are localized to retinal neurons and that the production of H(2)S is regulated by Ca(2+); H(2)S, in turn, regulates Ca(2+) influx into photoreceptor cells by activating vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). We also show that H(2)S protects retinal neurons from light-induced degeneration. The excessive levels of light exposure deteriorated photoreceptor cells and increased the number of TUNEL- and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)-positive cells. Degeneration was greatly suppressed in the retina of mice administered with NaHS, a donor of H(2)S. The present study provides a new insight into the regulation of H(2)S production and the modulation of the retinal transmission by H(2)S. It also shows a cytoprotective effect of H(2)S on retinal neurons and provides a basis for the therapeutic target for retinal degeneration.

BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous vasoactive agent, is produced by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) enzymes. This study was conducted to evaluate the relative contribution of these enzymes in regulating systemic arterial pressure.METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically treated with CGL inhibitor, DL-propargylglycine (PAG, 37.5 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneally, i.p.) or CBS inhibitor, aminooxyacetic acid (AOA, 8.75 mg/kg/day; i.p.) or in combination for 4 weeks and the effects on arterial pressure (tail-cuff plethysmography) and renal excretory function (24 h urine collections using metabolic cages) were assessed once in a week. Changes in renal blood flow (RBF; Ultrasonic flowmetry) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR; Inulin clearance) were assessed in acute experiments in anesthetized rats at the end of treatment period.RESULTS: Compared to vehicle treated control group, only the rats with combination therapy showed a decrease in urinary sulfate excretion rate (248 ± 47 vs. 591 ± 70 nmol/24 h; marker for endogenous H(2)S level) which was associated with an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP; 130 ± 2 vs. 99 ± 2 mm Hg). Urine flow and sodium excretion were also increased in combination group as consequent to the increase in MAP. GFR did not alter due to these treatments but RBF was lowered (4 ± 0.3 vs. 7 ± 0.4 ml/min/g) only in the combination group compared to the control group.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a deficiency in one enzyme's activity could be compensated by the activity of the other to maintain the endogenous H(2)S level, the deficiency of which modulates systemic and renal vascular resistances leading to the development of hypertension.

In the present study we tested the hypothesis whether hyperhomocysteinemia, an elevated homocysteine level, induces venous phenotype in artery. To test our hypothesis, we employed wild type (WT) and cystathionine ß-synthase heterozygous (+/-) (CBS+/-) mice treatment with or without folic acid (FA). Aortic blood flow and velocity were significantly lower in CBS+/-mice compared to WT. Aortic lumen diameter was significantly decreased in CBS+/-mice, whereas FA treatment normalized it. Medial thickness and collagen were significantly increased in CBS+/-aorta, whereas elastin/collagen ratio was significantly decreased. Superoxide and gelatinase activity was significantly high in CBS+/-aorta vs WT. Western blot showed significant increase in MMP-2, -9,-12, TIMP-2 and decrease in TIMP-4 in aorta. RT-PCR revealed significant increase of vena cava marker EphB4, MMP-13 and TIMP-3 in aorta. We summarize that chronic HHcy causes vascular remodelling that transduces changes in vascular wall in a way that artery expresses vein phenotype.

Biogenic amines have been demonstrated to protect cells from apoptotic cell death. Herein we show for the first time that serotonin and dopamine increase H(2)S production by the endogenous enzyme cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS) and protect cells against hypothermia/rewarming induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and apoptosis. Treatment with both compounds doubled CBS expression through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and increased H(2)S production in cultured rat smooth muscle cells. In addition, serotonin and dopamine treatment significantly reduced ROS formation. The beneficial effect of both compounds was minimized by inhibition of their re-uptake and by pharmacological inhibition of CBS or its down-regulation by siRNA. Exogenous administration of H(2)S and activation of CBS by Prydoxal 5'-phosphate also protected cells from hypothermic damage. Finally, serotonin and dopamine pretreatment of rat lung, kidney, liver and heart prior to 24 h of hypothermia at 3°C followed by 30 min of rewarming at 37°C upregulated the expression of CBS, strongly reduced caspase activity and maintained the physiological pH compared to untreated tissues. Thus, dopamine and serotonin protect cells against hypothermia/rewarming induced damage by increasing H(2)S production mediated through CBS. Our data identify a novel molecular link between biogenic amines and the H(2)S pathway, which may profoundly affect our understanding of the biological effects of monoamine neurotransmitters.

Human atherosclerotic coronary vessels elicited vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (Ach) and revealed a phenomenon of vasospasm. Homocysteine (Hcy) levels are elevated in the atherosclerotic plaque tissue, suggesting its pathological role in endothelial damage in atherosclerotic diseases. Accordingly, we examined the role hyperhomocysteinemia in coronary endothelial dysfunction, vessel wall thickness, lumen narrowing, leading to acute/chronic coronary vasospasm. The therapeutic potential and mechanisms of folic acid (FA) using hyperhomocysteinemic cystathionine beta synthase heterozygote (CBS-/+) and wild type (CBS+/+) mice were addressed. The CBS-/+ and CBS+/+ mice were treated with or without a Hcy lowering agent FA in drinking water (0.03 g/L) for 4 weeks. The isolated mouse septum coronary artery was cannulated and pressurized at 60 mmHg. The wall thickness and lumen diameters were measured by Ion-Optic. The vessels were treated with Ach (10(-8) -10(-5) <U+2009>M) and, for comparison, with non-endothelial vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (10(-5) <U+2009>M). The endothelium-impaired arteries from CBC-/+ mice constricted in response to Ach and this vasoconstriction was mitigated with FA supplementation. The level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was lower in coronary artery in CBS-/+ than of CBS+/+ mice. Treatment with FA increased the levels of Ach-induced NO generation in the coronary artery of CBS-/+ mice. The results suggest that Ach induced coronary vasoconstriction in CBS-/+ mice and this vasoconstriction was ameliorated by FA treatment. The mechanisms for the impairment of vascular function and therapeutic effects of FA may be related to the regulation of eNOS expression, NO availability and tissue homocysteine.

Tissue accumulation of homocysteine occurs in classical homocystinuria, a metabolic disease characterized biochemically by cystathionine ß-synthase deficiency. Vascular manifestations such as myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis, hepatic steatosis, and pulmonary embolism are common in this disease and poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia on some parameters of oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, protein carbonyl content, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence assay, and total radical-trapping antioxidant potent) and activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) in the rat lung. Reduced glutathione content and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, as well as nitrite levels, were also evaluated. Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous injections of Hcy (0.3-0.6 µmol/g body weight) from the 6th to the 28th days-of-age and the control group received saline. One and 12 h after the last injection, rats were killed and the lungs collected. Hyperhomocysteinemia increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to protein, and disrupted antioxidant defenses (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) in the lung of rats, characterizing a reliable oxidative stress. In contrast, this amino acid did not alter nitrite levels. Our findings showed a consistent profile of oxidative stress in the lung of rats, elicited by homocysteine, which could explain, at least in part, the mechanisms involved in the lung damage that is present in some homocystinuric patients.

Celiac disease (CD) is a polygenic chronic enteropathy conferring an increased risk for various nutrient deficiency states. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a frequent finding in CD and may be related to the development of venous thrombosis, cardiovascular disease, and stroke in untreated CD patients. Recently, a possible excess in the frequency of the MTHFR c.677C&gt;T (rs1801133) gene variant in CD patients was reported. The purpose of this study was to determine if there exist differences in the distribution of polymorphic variants of genes involved in homocysteine/methyl group metabolism between CD patients and the general population. A set of 10 gene polymorphisms (MTHFR rs1801133, MTR rs1805087, MTHFD1 rs2236225, MTRR rs1801394, CBS 844ins68, BHMT1 rs7356530 and rs3733890, BHMT2 rs526264 and rs625879, and TCN2 rs1801198) was tested in 134 patients with CD and 160 matched healthy controls. The frequency of the MTR rs1805087 GG genotype in CD patients was lower than in controls (0.01 and 0.06, respectively), although statistical significance was not achieved (P = 0.06). For the other analyzed polymorphisms, there was no evidence of difference in both allelic and genotypic distribution between cases and controls. The exhaustive Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis revealed no combination of interactive polymorphisms predicting the incidence of CD. In contrast to the well-documented clinical observations of increased risks of vascular disease in patients with longstanding untreated CD, in our group of patients no significant association with CD was found for all tested polymorphic variants of genes involved in homocysteine metabolism. These findings should be replicated in studies with a larger sample size.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for ischemic cardiovascular diseases, but its causal role in atherothrombosis remains controversial. Proatherogenic and/or prothrombotic effects may underlie the potential causal relation between hyperhomocysteinemia and cardiovascular events. Here, the effects of selective lowering of plasma homocysteine, plasma cholesterol, or both on endothelial function and on atherogenesis in male hyperlipidemic and hyperhomocysteinemic C57BL/6 low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr)(-/-)/cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS)(+/-)-deficient mice were investigated. Second, we evaluated whether selective homocysteine lowering has anti-thrombotic effects in a model of arterial thrombosis. A hyperhomocysteinemic and atherogenic diet was started at the age of 12 weeks. Three weeks later, gene transfer was performed with E1E3E4-deleted adenoviral vectors for hepatocyte-restricted overexpression of CBS (AdCBS) or of the LDLr (AdLDLr), or with the control vector Adnull. In a fourth group, AdCBS and AdLDLr were co-administered. Selective homocysteine lowering but not selective cholesterol lowering restored endothelial function at 6 weeks after gene transfer. Intimal area in the aortic root and in the brachiocephalic artery at 13 weeks was more than 100-fold (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) smaller in AdLDLr and AdCBS/AdLDLr mice than in control mice and AdCBS mice. No differences in intimal area were observed between control mice and AdCBS mice. In a model of carotid artery thrombosis, the average time to first occlusion and to stable occlusion were 1.9-fold (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01) and 2.1-fold longer (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01), respectively, in AdCBS-treated mice than in control mice. Taken together, these data show that correction of endothelial dysfunction following selective homocysteine lowering has anti-thrombotic but no anti-atherogenic effects.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with endothelial dysfunction (ED), but the mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of HHcy-induced ED in microvasculature in our newly established mouse model of severe HHcy (plasma total homocysteine, 169.5 µM). We found that severe HHcy impaired nitric oxide (NO)- and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-mediated, endothelium-dependent relaxations of small mesenteric arteries (SMAs). Endothelium-independent and prostacyclin-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations were not changed. A nonselective Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel (K(Ca)) inhibitor completely blocked EDHF-mediated relaxation. Selective blockers for small-conductance K(Ca) (SK) or intermediate-conductance K(Ca) (IK) failed to inhibit EDHF-mediated relaxation in HHcy mice. HHcy increased the levels of SK3 and IK1 protein, superoxide (O(2)(-)), and 3-nitrotyrosine in the endothelium of SMAs. Preincubation with antioxidants and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) inhibitors improved endothelium-dependent and EDHF-mediated relaxations and decreased O(2)(-) production in SMAs from HHcy mice. Further, EDHF-mediated relaxation was inhibited by ONOO(-) and prevented by catalase in the control mice. Finally, L-homocysteine stimulated O(2)(-) production, which was reversed by antioxidants, and increased SK/IK protein levels and tyrosine nitration in cultured human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that HHcy impairs EDHF relaxation in SMAs by inhibiting SK/IK activities via oxidation- and tyrosine nitration-related mechanisms.

To report a case of late diagnosis of a classical familial homocystinuria based on an ophthalmologic examination. A 35-year-old male with Marfan-like phenotype complained of a progressive increase of myopia during the previous 2 years. Ophthalmologic exploration showed a bilateral subluxation of the lens with inferior and nasal displacement. Biochemical study detected a profile of increased amino acid levels (homocysteinemia) consistent with suspected homocystinuria. Vascular and skeletal studies ruled out Marfan syndrome. Response to treatment demonstrated B(6)-non-responsive homocystinuria. Molecular study showed compound heterozygous T353 N and D444 N mutations of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, and also a C667T homozygous mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene. Family study showed classical homocystinuria in his father and sister, although they did not present any systemic or ocular features of the disease. Homocystinuria is a metabolic disease usually presenting at an early age as vascular, skeletal and neuropsychiatric abnormalities, as well as ectopia lentis. Our case is atypical because of the absence of thromboembolism and the mild phenotype, in spite of being B(6)-non-responsive, and the association of a rare compound heterozygous mutation of the CBS gene and also an homozygous mutation of the MTHFR gene. It is necessary to rule out homocystinuria in patients with ectopia lentis, even in the absence of systemic symptoms.

Cardiovascular disorders and coronary artery disease (CAD) are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in heart patients. As genes of the folate/homocysteine pathway have been linked with the vascular disease, we investigated association of these gene polymorphisms with CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) using the novel approach of tetraprimer ARMS-PCR. A total of 230 participants (129 MI cases, 101 normal subjects) were recruited. We genotyped rs1801133 and rs1801131 SNPs in 5'10' methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), rs1805087 SNP in 5' methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), rs662 SNP in paroxanse1 (PON1), and rs5742905 polymorphism in cystathionine beta synthase (CBS). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion polymorphism was detected through conventional PCR. Covariates included blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and creatinine concentrations. Our results showed allele frequencies at rs1801133, rs1801131, rs1805087 and the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism varied between cases and controls. Logistic regression, after adjusting for covariates, demonstrated significant associations of rs1801133 and rs1805087 with CAD in the additive, dominant, and genotype model. In contrast, ACE I/D polymorphism was significantly related with CAD where recessive model was applied. Gene-gene interaction against the disease status revealed two polymorphism groups: rs1801133, rs662, and rs1805087; and rs1801131, rs662, and ACE I/D. Only the latter interaction maintained significance after adjusted for covariates. Our study concludes that folate pathway variants exert contributory influence on susceptibility to CAD. We further suggest that tetraprimer ARMS-PCR successfully resolves the genotypes in selected samples and might prove to be a superior technique compared to the conventional approach.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a novel gasotransmitter with physiological and pathological functions in vascular homeostasis, cardiovascular system and central nervous system. In the present study, we determined the endogenous levels of H(2)S in various tissues of the bovine eye. We also examined the basal levels of H(2)S in response to donors (sodium hydrosulfide, NaHS and sodium sulfide, Na(2)S), substrate (L: -cysteine), inhibitors (propargylglycine, PAG and aminooxyacetic acid, AOA) and activator (S-adenosyl-L: -methionine, SAM) of this gas in the bovine retina. H(2)S was measured using a well established spectrophotometric method. The highest concentration of endogenous H(2)S was detected in cornea (19 ± 2.85 nmoles/mg protein, n = 6) and retina (17 ± 2.1 nmoles/mg protein, n = 6). Interestingly, H(2)S was not present in vitreous humor. The inhibitors of CSE and CBS; PAG (1 mM) and AOA (1 mM), significantly attenuated the production of H(2)S in the bovine retina by 56.8 and 42%, respectively. On the other hand the activator of CBS; SAM (100 µM), H(2)S donors; NaHS (1 µM) and Na(2)S (100 µM), significantly increased endogenous levels of H(2)S in bovine retina. L: -cysteine (10-300 µM) produced a significant (P &lt; 0.05) concentration-dependent increase in H(2)S levels reaching a maximal at 300 µM. We conclude that H(2)S is endogenously produced in various tissues of the isolated bovine eye. Moreover, endogenous levels of H(2)S are enhanced in the presence of substrate (L: -cysteine), an activator of CBS (SAM) and H(2)S donors but are blocked by inhibitors of enzymes that synthesize this gas in neural retina.

Endogenous levels of sulfide in the brain have been measured in rats, humans and bovines in 1989 and 1990, suggesting that H(2)S may have a physiological function. We demonstrated in 1996 that cystathionine ß-synthase can produce H(2)S in the brain and that H(2)S facilitates the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation by enhancing the activity of NMDA receptors. The following year, we showed that another H(2)S-producing enzyme, cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, is expressed in the thoracic aorta, portal vein and ileum and that H(2)S relaxes these tissues. We proposed that H(2)S may be a neuromodulator as well as a smooth muscle relaxant. In addition to a function as a signalling molecule, we demonstrated another function as a cytoprotectant in 2004. Hydrogen sulfide protects neurons from oxidative stress by reinstating the reduced glutathione levels. We recently demonstrated that a third H(2)S-producing enzyme, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), is expressed in neurons and vascular endothelium. In addition to reinstating glutathione levels, H(2)S produced by 3MST, which is mainly localized to mitochondria, reduces reactive oxygen species generated in these organelles.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency results in elevated plasma homocysteine and methionine levels, which are associated with multiple organ pathologies, including vascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, nervous, and ocular tissues. This autosomal recessive disorder is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the CBS gene encoding for the CBS. Although homocystinuria is observed in Arab and North African patients, their clinical presentations have not been described and molecular causes remained largely uninvestigated. In this study, we describe the clinical presentations of 22 homocystinuria patients from 13 Saudi Arabian families and 1 North African Sudanese family. Cardinal biochemical features of homocystinuria manifested in all patients, but heterogeneity of expression was observed for other associated phenotypes. One patient developed Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease that has not been previously described in homocystinuria. In the Saudi families, a novel nonsense mutation, p.Trp323X, and recurrent p.Arg336Cys and p.Gly153Arg mutations were identified in the CBS gene. The p.Trp323X mutation was found in 10 of the 13 unrelated Saudi families. In the Sudanese family, the p.Thr257Met mutation in the CBS gene, previously described in Italian and Spanish patients, was found. This study shows that the spectrum of CBS gene mutations in Saudi homocystinuria patients is quite different than the Arab patients from Qatar and Israel. This study is the only detailed phenotypic and genetic depiction of homocystinuria patients from Saudi Arabia and Sudan. The data are useful for diagnosis and management of Saudi patients.

AIMS: The mutual interactions between reactive oxygen species, airway inflammation, and alveolar cell death play crucial role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) might be a novel option for intervention in COPD.RESULTS: We used a mouse model of tobacco smoke (TS)-induced emphysema. Mice were injected with H(2)S donor NaHS (50 µmol/kg in 0.25 ml phosphate buffer saline, intraperitoneally) or vehicle daily before exposed to TS for 1 h/day, 5 days/week for 12 and 24 weeks. We found that NaHS ameliorated TS-induced increase in mean linear intercepts, the thickness of bronchial walls, and the numbers of total cell counts as well as neutrophils, monocytes, and tumor necrosis factor a in bronchial alveolar lavage. Moreover, NaHS reduced increases in right ventricular systolic pressure, the thickness of pulmonary vascular walls, and the ratio of RV/LV+S in TS-exposed mice. Further, TS exposure for 12 and 24 weeks reduced the protein contents of cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CGL), cystathionine ß-synthetase (CBS), nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2), P(ser473)-Akt, as well as glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio in the lungs. TS-exposed lungs exhibited large amounts of 8-hydroxyguanine-positive and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells. Treatment with NaHS increased P(ser473)-Akt and attenuated TS-induced reduction of CGL, CBS, and Nrf2 as well as glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio in the lungs. NaHS also reduced amounts of 8-hydroxyguanine-positive, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells and active caspase-3 in TS-exposed lungs. Additionally, knocking-down Akt protein abolished the protective effects of NaHS against TS-induced apoptosis and downregulation of Nrf2, CGL, and CBS in pulmonary artery endothelial cells.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that NaHS protects against TS-induced oxidative stress, airway inflammation, and remodeling and ameliorates the development of emphysema and pulmonary hypertension. H(2)S donors have therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of COPD caused by TS.

Deficiencies in folate lead to increased serum concentrations of homocysteine (Hcy), which is known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), is associated with bone disorders. Although, Hcy accumulates collagen in bone and contribute to decrease in bone strength. The mechanism of Hcy induced bone loss and remodeling is unclear. Therefore, the present study was aimed to determine the role of folic acid (FA) in genetically HHcy-associated decrease in bone blood flow and remodeling. Wild type (WT) and cystathionine-ß-synthase heterozygous (CBS+/-) mice were used in this study and supplemented with or without FA (300<U+2009>mg/kg, Hcy reducing agent) in drinking water for 6 weeks. The tibial bone blood flow was measured by laser Doppler and ultrasonic flow probe method. The tibial bone density (BD) was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The bone homogenates were analyzed for oxidative stress, NOX-4 as oxidative marker and thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) as anti-oxidant marker, bone remodeling (MMP-9) and bio-availability of nitric oxide (eNOS/iNOS/NO) by Western blot method. The results suggested that there was decrease in tibial blood flow in CBS+/- mice. The BD was also reduced in CBS+/- mice. There was an increase in NOX-4, iNOS, MMP-9 protein as well as MMP-9 activity in CBS+/- mice and decrease in Trx-1, eNOS protein levels, in part by decreasing NO bio-availability in CBS+/- mice. Interestingly, these effects were ameliorated by FA and suggested that FA supplementation may have therapeutic potential against genetically HHcy induced bone loss.

AIM: To compare the vasorelaxing effects of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) on isolated aortic and pulmonary artery rings and to determine their action mechanisms.METHODS: H(2)S-induced vasorelaxation of isolated rat aortic versus pulmonary artery rings under 95% O(2) and 5% CO(2) was analyzed. The expression of cystathinonine gamma-lyase (CSE), cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), SUR2B and Kir6.1 was examined.RESULTS: NaHS caused vasorelaxation of rat aortic and pulmonary artery rings in a dose-dependent manner. NaHS dilated aortic rings to a greater extent (16.4%, 38.4%, 64.1%, 84.3%, and 95.9% at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 µmol/L, respectively) than pulmonary artery rings (10.1%, 22.2%, 50.6%, 73.6%, and 84.6% at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 µmol/L, respectively). The EC(50) of the vasorelaxant effect for aortic rings was 152.17 µmol/L, whereas the EC(50) for pulmonary artery rings was 233.65 µmol/L. The vasorelaxing effect of H(2)S was markedly blocked b y cellular and mitochondrial membrane K(ATP) channel blockers in aortic rings (P&lt;0.01). In contrast, only the cellular membrane K(ATP) channel blocker inhibited H(2)S-induced vasorelaxation in pulmonary artery rings. SUR2B mRNA and protein expression was higher in aortic rings than in pulmonary artery rings. Cystathinonine gamma-lyase (CSE) but not cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) expression in aortic rings was higher than in pulmonary artery rings. 3-Mercapto pyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) mRNA was lower in aortic rings than in pulmonary artery rings.CONCLUSION: The vasorelaxing effect of H(2)S on isolated aortic rings was more pronounced than the effect on pulmonary artery rings at specific concentrations, which might be associated with increased expression of the K(ATP) channel subunit SUR2B.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a gaseous transmitter involved in the control of vascular homeostasis. H(2)S is formed endogenously from L-cysteine or L-methionine by two enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), and normally circulates in blood. Studies from the past few years have demonstrated the involvement of H(2)S in erectile mechanisms in animal and human tissues. Exogenous H(2)S relaxes human and animal tissues in vitro and increases intracavernous pressure in experimental animal models. Electrical field stimulation studies on animal and human tissues have demonstrated that endogenous H(2)S is involved in the physiological control of penile tone. In humans, both CBS and CSE are widely expressed on trabecular muscle, implying that the smooth muscle component is the major source of H(2)S. Thus, the L-cysteine-H(2)S pathway may represent a promising target for development of new therapeutics for erectile dysfunction.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has been established as the third gaseous signaling molecule following nitric oxide and carbon monoxide and participates in a variety of cellular functions such as modulation of neuronal transmission, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, stimulation of angiogenesis and regulation of insulin release. Although cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase have been regarded as the main producers of H(2)S in many tissues including brain, liver and kidney, Kimura and his colleagues have recently communicated that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase coupled with cysteine (aspartate) aminotransferase is responsible for the production of H(2)S in the vascular endothelium of the thoracic aorta [Shibuya et al. (2009) J. Biochem. 146, 623-626]. This finding provides a new insight into the production of the physiologically important signaling molecule.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule that appears to be involved in numerous biological processes, including regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone. The present study is designed to address the hypothesis that H2S is a functionally significant, endogenous dilator in the newborn cerebrovascular circulation. In vivo experiments were conducted using newborn pigs with surgically implanted, closed, cranial windows. Topical application of H2S concentration-dependently (10(-6) to 2×10(-4) M) dilated pial arterioles. This dilation was blocked by glibenclamide (10(-6) M). L-cysteine, the substrate of the H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), also dilated pial arterioles. The dilation to L-cysteine was blocked by the CSE inhibitor d,l-propargylglycine (PPG, 10 mM) but was unaffected by the CBS inhibitor amino-oxyacetate (AOA, 1 mM). Western blots detected CSE, but not CBS, in cerebral microvessels, whereas CBS is detected in brain parenchyma. Immunohistological CSE expression is predominantly vascular while CBS is expressed mainly in neurons and astrocytes. L-cysteine (5 mM) increased H2S concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), measured by GC-MS, from 561±205 to 2,783±818 nM before but not during treatment with PPG (1,030±70 to 622±78 nM). Dilation to hypercapnia was inhibited by PPG but not AOA. Hypercapnia increased CSF H2S concentration from 763±243 to 4,337±1789 nM before but not during PPG treatment (357±178 vs. 425±217 nM). These data show that H2S is a dilator of the newborn cerebral circulation and that endogenous CSE can produce sufficient H2S to decrease vascular tone. H2S appears to be a physiologically significant dilator in the cerebral circulation.

In hypertension, an increase in arterial wall thickness and loss of elasticity over time result in an increase in pulse wave velocity, a direct measure of arterial stiffness. This change is reflected in gradual fragmentation and loss of elastin fibers and accumulation of stiffer collagen fibers in the media that occurs independently of atherosclerosis. Similar results are seen with an elevated level of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), which increases vascular thickness, elastin fragmentation, and arterial blood pressure. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated a decrease in elasticity and an increase in pulse wave velocity in HHcy cystathionine ß synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS(-/+)) mice. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in MMP-NO-TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) inhibitory tertiary complex. We have demonstrated the contribution of the NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, in the activation of latent MMP. The differential production of NO contributes to oxidative stress and increased oxidative/nitrative activation of MMP resulting in vascular remodeling in response to HHcy. The contribution of the NOS isoforms, endothelial and inducible in the collagen/elastin switch, has been demonstrated. We have showed that an increase in inducible NOS activity is a key contributor to HHcy-mediated collagen/elastin switch and resulting decline in aortic compliance. In addition, increased levels of Hcy compete and suppress the <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid-receptor, N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. The HHcy causes oxidative stress by generating nitrotyrosine, activating the latent MMPs and decreasing the endothelial NO concentration. The HHcy causes elastinolysis and decrease elastic complicance of the vessel wall. The treatment with <U+03B3>-amino butyric acid-receptor agonist (muscimol), N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist (MK-801), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (ciprofibrate and ciglitazone) mitigates the cardiovascular dysfunction in HHcy [corrected].

Research in the last two decades has transformed the way hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is perceived from a noxious gas to a gaso-transmitter with a vast potential in pharmacotherapy. H2S is synthesized in various body-systems using the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase; either of these being the predominat enzyme in a particular system. H2S may be one of the physiological modulators of blood pressure in humans. The gas relaxes the vascular smooth muscle cells by opening up K(ATP) channels. Moreover, it suppresses the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. H2S may also be contributing in the protection afforded by ischaemia-preconditioning. Testosterone is thought to be responsible for the higher central nervous system level of H2S in males. In the central nervous system, H2S is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, stroke and Down's syndrome. Insulin secretion is associated with a decrease in the H2S levels. Raised H2S is detrimental in acute pancreatitis as well as in septic shock. Recently, H2S-releasing derivatives of certain drugs have shown promise in protection against gastric ulcer and in inflammatory bowel disease. The beneficial effects of certain sulphur containing herbs like ginseng and garlic may be mediated via H2S. In future, development of specific drugs modulating H2S levels may prove beneficial in varied disorders.

Remodeling by its very nature implies synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components (such as elastin, collagen, and connexins). Most of the vascular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are latent because of the presence of constitutive nitric oxide (NO). However, during oxidative stress peroxinitrite (ONOO-) activates the latent MMPs and instigates vascular remodeling. Interestingly, in mesenteric artery, homocysteine (Hcy) decreases the NO bio-availability, and folic acid (FA, an Hcy-lowering agent) mitigates the Hcy-mediated mesentery artery dysfunction. Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2 (DDAH-2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) increases NO production. The hypothesis was that the Hcy decreased NO bio-availability, in part, activating MMP, decreasing elastin, DDAH-2, eNOS and increased vasomotor response by increasing connexin. To test this hypothesis,the authors used 12-week-old C57BJ/L6 wild type (WT) and hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy)-cystathione beta synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS+/-) mice. Blood pressure measurements were made by radio-telemetry. WT and MMP-9 knockout mice were administered with Hcy (0.67 mg/ml in drinking water). Superior mesenteric artery and mesenteric arcade were analyzed with light and confocal microscopy. The protein expressions were measured by western blot analysis. The mRNA levels for MMP-9 were measured by RT-PCR. The data showed decreased DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions in mesentery in CBS-/+ mice compared with WT mice. Immuno-fluorescence and western blot results suggest increased MMP-9 and connexin-40 expression in mesenteric arcades of CBS-/+ mice compared with WT mice. The wall thickness of third-order mesenteric artery was increased in CBS-/+ mice compared to WT mice. Hcy treatment increased blood pressure in WT mice. Interestingly, in MMP-9 KO, Hcy did not increase blood pressure. These results may suggest that HHcy causes mesenteric artery remodeling and narrowing by activating MMP-9 and decreasing DDAH-2 and eNOS expressions, compromising the blood flow, instigating hypertension, and acute abdomen pain.

Homocysteine (Hcy), a cardiovascular and neurovascular disease risk factor, is converted to hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) through the transsulfuration pathway. H(2)S has attracted considerable attention in recent years for many positive effects on vascular health and homeostasis. Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) is the first, and rate-limiting, enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway. Mutations in the CBS gene decrease enzymatic activity, which increases the plasma Hcy concentration, a condition called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). Animal models of CBS deficiency have provided invaluable insights into the pathological effects of transsulfuration impairment and of both mild and severe HHcy. However, studies have also highlighted the complexity of HHcy and the need to explore the specific details of Hcy metabolism in addition to Hcy levels per se. There has been a relative paucity of work addressing the dysfunctional H(2)S production in CBS deficiency that may contribute to, or even create, HHcy-associated pathologies. Experiments using CBS knockout mice, both homozygous (-/-) and heterozygous (+/-), have provided 15 years of new knowledge and are the focus of this review. These murine models present the opportunity to study a specific mechanism for HHcy that matches one of the etiologies in many human patients. Therefore, the goal of this review was to integrate and highlight the critical information gained thus far from models of CBS deficiency and draw attention to critical gaps in knowledge, with particular emphasis on the modulation of H(2)S metabolism. We include findings from human and animal studies to identify important opportunities for future investigation that should be aimed at generating new basic and clinical understanding of the role of CBS and transsulfuration in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease.

AIM: Recent studies have suggested a relation of homocysteine with lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to analyze a possible genetic basis for such a relation in 504 individuals including 135 consecutive Caucasian patients diagnosed with cerebrovascular disease as well as the patients' healthy spouses (n = 100) and offspring (n = 269).METHODS: We analyzed the association of plasma levels of lipoprotein(a), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides with plasma homocysteine levels and with the following 7 variants of homocysteine metabolism: dihydrofolate reductase c.594 + 59del19bp, cystathionine ß-synthase c.844_855ins68, methionine synthase c.2756A<U+2192>G, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase c.677C<U+2192>T and c.1298A<U+2192>C, reduced folate carrier 1 c.80G<U+2192>A, and transcobalamin 2 (Tc2) c.776C<U+2192>G.RESULTS: Linear regression analysis showed an association of Tc2 c.776C<U+2192>G with LDL (p = 0.010), HDL (p = 0.009), and TG (p = 0.007), with the G allele of Tc2 c.776C<U+2192>G associated with an unfavorable blood lipid profile. Moreover, the G allele of Tc2 c.776C<U+2192>G was associated with higher homocysteine plasma levels in the subgroup of patients (p = 0.013, 1-way ANOVA).CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that alterations in homocysteine metabolism and an unfavorable blood lipoprotein profile may have a common genetic basis. Such conditions may be relevant for studies investigating independent risk factors for vascular disease.

Elevated level of homocysteine (Hcy) induces chronic inflammation in vascular bed, including glomerulus, and promotes glomerulosclerosis. In this study we investigated in vitro mechanism of Hcy-mediated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) induction and determined the regulatory role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to ameliorate inflammation. Mouse glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) were incubated with Hcy (75 µM) and supplemented with vehicle or with H2S (30 µM, in the form of NaHS). Inflammatory molecules MCP-1 and MIP-2 were measured by ELISA. Cellular capability to generate H2S was measured by colorimetric chemical method. To enhance endogenous production of H2S and better clearance of Hcy, cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) genes were delivered to the cells. Oxidative NAD(P)H p47(phox) was measured by Western blot analysis and immunostaining. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1/2) were measured by Western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that Hcy upregulated inflammatory molecules MCP-1 and MIP-2, whereas endogenous production of H2S was attenuated. H2S treatment as well as CBS and CSE doubly cDNA overexpression markedly reduced Hcy-induced upregulation of MCP-1 and MIP-2. Hcy-induced upregulation of oxidative p47(phox) was attenuated by H2S supplementation and CBS/CSE overexpression as well. In addition to that we also detected Hcy-induced MCP-1 and MIP-2 induction was through phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2. Either H2S supplementation or CBS and CSE doubly cDNA overexpression attenuated Hcy-induced phosphorylation of these two signaling molecules and diminished MCP-1 and MIP-2 expressions. Similar results were obtained by inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 using pharmacological and small interferring RNA (siRNA) blockers. We conclude that H2S plays a regulatory role in Hcy-induced mesangial inflammation and that ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 are two signaling pathways involved this process.

Although protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) play significant role in vascular remodelling in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency, CBS-/+) and diabetes, mechanism remains nebulous. We hypothesized that differential vascular density and remodelling in different vascular beds in HHcy and diabetes were responsible for an adaptive metabolic homeostasis during the pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, vascular density in mice lacking PAR-1, MMP-9, CBS and Insulin-2 gene mutant (Ins2-/+, Akita) was measured and compared with wild type (WT, C57BL/6J) mice. The vascular density was detected by x-ray angiography using KODAK 4000 MM image station, using barium sulphate as contrasting agent. The % vascular density in the hearts of WT, CBS-/+ (HHcy), MMP-9-/-, PAR-1-/+ and Ins2-/+ (type-1 diabetes) was 100 ± 2.8, 85 ± 3.3, 90 ± 3.3, 95 ± 3.8 and 73 ± 1.7, respectively. The vascular density in CBS-/+ and Akita hearts decreased while it was increased in lungs of CBS-/+ and MMP-9-/-.There was decreased vascular density in liver and kidney of Akita mice. Vascular density in brain, kidney and mesentery was decreased in CBS-/+ mice. These findings support the notation that metabolic derangement in diabetes and HHcy causes the chronic decline and/or rarefaction in vascular density.

Homocysteine, a cardiovascular and neurocognitive disease risk factor, is converted to hydrogen sulfide, a cardiovascular and neuronal protectant, through the transsulfuration pathway. Given the damaging effects of free homocysteine in the blood and the importance of blood homocysteine concentration as a prognosticator of disease, we tested the hypotheses that the blood itself regulates homocysteine-hydrogen sulfide metabolism through transsulfuration and that transsulfuration capacity and hydrogen sulfide availability protect the endothelium from redox stress. Here we show that the transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine ß-synthase and cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase, are secreted by microvascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes, circulate as members of the plasma proteome, and actively produce hydrogen sulfide from homocysteine in human blood. We further demonstrate that extracellular transsulfuration regulates cell function when the endothelium is challenged with homocysteine and that hydrogen sulfide protects the endothelium from serum starvation and from hypoxia-reoxygenation injury. These novel findings uncover a unique set of opportunities to explore innovative clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies in the approach to homocysteine-related conditions such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and dementia.

A posttranslational protein modification by homocysteine-thiolactone (N-homocysteinylation) is linked to human vascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Although chemical and immunological methods are available to detect and quantify the extent of protein N-homocysteinylation, the determination of site-specific N-homocysteinylation in vivo remains challenging. Here we describe a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method that monitors the extent of N-homocysteinylation at albumin lysine-525 in vivo directly in human serum. Using this method, we found that the extent of lysine-525 N-homocysteinylation was significantly increased in patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.

Homocysteine is an intermediate of methionine metabolism, and its elevation in tissues is correlated with an increased risk for vascular diseases. We measured homocysteine in plasma of 24 patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and long-term high excretion of heme precursors. Fifteen (62.5%) presented hyperhomocysteinemia (total homocysteine in plasma &gt;15 µmol/L). No association was found between hyperhomocysteinemia and either urinary excretion of heme precursors or clinical status. All the patients showed normal levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid, but 13 (54%) presented low plasma levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP &lt;15 nmol/L). Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes a major removal pathway of homocysteine and is dependent on both PLP and heme as cofactors. It is hypothesized that, in AIP, CBS reduced hepatic activity resulting from either a low heme status and/or consumptive depletion of PLP due to increased demand by 5-aminolevulinatesynthase hyperactivity can induce hyperhomocysteinemia.

A decrease in vascular elasticity and an increase in pulse wave velocity in hyperhomocysteinemic (HHcy) cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout (CBS(-/+)) mice has been observed. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potential regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in MMP-NO-tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) inhibitory tertiary complex. However, the contribution of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms eNOS and iNOS in the activation of latent MMP is unclear. We hypothesize that the differential production of NO contributes to oxidative stress and increased oxidative/nitrative activation of MMP, resulting in vascular remodeling in response to HHcy. The overall goal is to elucidate the contribution of the NOS isoforms, endothelial and inducible, in the collagen/elastin switch. Experiments were performed on six groups of animals [wild-type (WT), eNOS(-/-), and iNOS(-/-) with and without homocysteine (Hcy) treatment (0.67 g/l) for 8-12 wk]. In vivo echograph was performed to assess aortic timed flow velocity for indirect compliance measurement. Histological determination of collagen and elastin with trichrome and van Gieson stains, respectively, was performed. In situ measurement of superoxide generation using dihydroethidium was used. Differential expression of eNOS, iNOS, nitrotyrosine, MMP-2 and -9, and elastin were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses. The 2% gelatin zymography was used to assess MMP activity. The increase in O(2)(-) and robust activity of MMP-9 in eNOS(-/-), WT+Hcy, and eNOS(-/-)+Hcy was accompanied by the gross disorganization and thickening of the ECM along with extensive collagen deposition and elastin degradation (collagen/elastin switch) resulting in a decrease in aortic timed flow velocity. Results show that an increase in iNOS activity is a key contributor to HHcy-mediated collagen/elastin switch and resulting decline in aortic compliance.

Several recent studies describing a solely vascular presentation of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency in adulthood prompted us to analyze the frequency of patients manifesting with vascular complications in the Czech Republic. Between 1980 and 2009, a total of 20 Czech patients with CBS deficiency have been diagnosed yielding an incidence of 1:311,000. These patients were divided into three groups based on symptoms leading to diagnosis: those with vascular complications, with connective tissue manifestation and with neurological presentation. A vascular event such as a clinical feature leading to diagnosis of homocystinuria was present in five patients, while two of them had no other symptoms typical for CBS deficiency at the time of diagnosis. All patients with the vascular manifestation were diagnosed only during the past decade. The median age of diagnosis was 29 years in the vascular, 11.5 years in the connective tissue and 4.5 years in the neurological group. The ratio of pyridoxine responsive to nonresponsive patients was higher in the vascular (4 of 5 patients) and connective tissue groups (6 of 7 patients) than in the neurological group (2 of 8 patients). Mutation c.833T&gt;C (p.I278T) was frequent in patients with vascular (6/10 alleles) and connective tissue presentation (8/14 alleles), while it was not present in patients with neurological involvement (0/16 alleles). During the last decade, we have observed patients with homocystinuria diagnosed solely due to vascular events; this milder form of homocystinuria usually manifests at greater ages, has a high ratio of pyridoxine responsiveness/nonresponsiveness, and the mutation c.833T&gt;C (p.I278T) is often present.

Apart from nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the third gaseous mediator in mammals. H2S is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), or by sequential action of alanine aminotransferase and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In the cardiovascular system, H2S is involved in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure, inhibits atherogenesis, and protects myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recently, the first organic, water-soluble H2S donor, GYY4137, has been synthesized. In addition, H2S-releasing derivatives of several currently used drugs such as sildenafil, diclofenac, aspirin and mesalamine were obtained. Such compounds may be used in the future treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this article, I describe the role of H2S in the regulation of blood pressure and in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis which are two most common cardiovascular disorders.

Hydrogen sulfide gas (H(2)S) is a putative signaling molecule that causes diverse effects in mammalian tissues including relaxation of blood vessels and regulation of perfusion in the liver, but the effects of aging on H(2)S signaling are unknown. Aging has negative impacts on the cardiovascular system. However, the liver is more resilient with age. Caloric restriction (CR) attenuates affects of age in many tissues. We hypothesized that the H(2)S signaling system is negatively affected by age in the vasculature but not in the liver, which is typically more resilient to age, and that a CR diet minimizes the age affect in the vasculature. To investigate this, we determined protein and mRNA expression of the H(2)S-producing enzymes cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS), H(2)S production rates in the aorta and liver, and the contractile response of aortic rings to exogenous H(2)S. Tissue was collected from Fisher 344 × Brown Norway rats from 8-38 months of age, which had been maintained on an ad libitum (AL) or CR diet. The results demonstrate that age and diet have differential effects on the H(2)S signaling system in aorta and liver. The aorta showed a sizeable effect of both age and diet, whereas the liver only showed a sizeable effect of diet. Aortic rings showed increased contractile sensitivity to H(2)S and increased protein expression of CSE and CBS with age, consistent with a decrease in H(2)S concentration with age. CR appears to benefit CSE and CBS protein in both aorta and liver, potentially by reducing oxidative stress and ameliorating the negative effect of age on H(2)S concentration. Therefore, CR may help maintain the H(2)S signaling system during aging.

AIMS: In this study we tested the hypothesis that H(2)S regulates collagen deposition, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and inflammatory molecules during hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) resulting in attenuation of glomerulosclerosis and improved renal function.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A genetic model of HHcy, cystathionine beta-synthase heterozygous (CBS+/-) and wild-type (WT) 2-kidney (2K) mice were used in this study and supplemented with or without NaHS (30 micromol/l, H(2)S donor) in drinking water for 8 weeks. To expedite the renal damage associated with HHcy, uninephrectomized (1K) mice of similar groups were also used.RESULTS: Results demonstrated that NAD(P)H oxidase (p47(phox)subunit) and blood pressure were upregulated in WT 1K, CBS+/- 2K and CBS+/- 1K mice with downregulation of H(2)S production and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These changes were normalized with H(2)S supplementation. Both pro- and active MMP-2 and -9 and collagen protein expressions and glomerular depositions were also upregulated in WT 1K, CBS+/- 2K and CBS+/- 1K mice. Increased expressions of inflammatory molecules, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, as well as increased macrophage infiltration, were detected in WT 1K, CBS+/- 2K and CBS+/- 1K mice. These changes were ameliorated with H(2)S supplementation.CONCLUSION: Together, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress and decreased H(2)S in HHcy causes matrix remodeling and inflammation resulting in glomerulosclerosis and reduced renal function.

Mitochondrial mechanism of oxidative stress and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation was unclear. Our recent data suggested that MMPs are localized to mitochondria and activated by peroxynitrite, which causes cardiovascular remodeling and failure. Recently, we have demonstrated that elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) increase oxidative stress in the mitochondria. Although HHcy causes heart failure, interestingly, it is becoming very clear that Hcy can generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S), if the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) are present. H2S is a strong anti-oxidant and vasorelaxing agent. Paradoxically, it is interesting that Hcy, a precursor of H2S can be cardioprotective. The CGL is ubiquitous, while the CBS is not present in the vascular tissues. Therefore, under normal condition, only half of Hcy can be converted to H2S. However, there is strong potential for gene therapy of CBS to vascular tissue that can mitigate the detrimental effects of Hcy by converting it to H2S. This scenario is possible, if the activities of both the enzymes (CBS and CGL) are increased in tissues by gene therapy.

Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are well established as messenger molecules throughout the body, gasotransmitters, based on striking alterations in mice lacking the appropriate biosynthetic enzymes. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is even more chemically reactive, but until recently there was little definitive evidence for its physiologic formation. Cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22), and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE; EC 4.4.1.1), also known as cystathionine, can generate H(2)S from cyst(e)ine. Very recent studies with mice lacking these enzymes have established that CSE is responsible for H(2)S formation in the periphery, while in the brain cystathionine beta-synthase is the biosynthetic enzyme. Endothelial-derived relaxing factor activity is reduced 80% in the mesenteric artery of mice with deletion of CSE, establishing H(2)S as a major physiologic endothelial-derived relaxing factor. H(2)S appears to signal predominantly by S-sulfhydrating cysteines in its target proteins, analogous to S-nitrosylation by NO. Whereas S-nitrosylation typically inhibits enzymes, S-sulfhydration activates them. S-nitrosylation basally affects 1-2% of its target proteins, while 10-25% of H(2)S target proteins are S-sulfhydrated. In summary, H(2)S appears to be a physiologic gasotransmitter of comparable importance to NO and carbon monoxide.

An elevated level of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), was associated with neurovascular diseases. At physiological levels, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) protected the neurovascular system. Because Hcy was also a precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), we sought to test whether the H(2)S protected the brain during HHcy. Cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygous (CBS+/-) and wild type (WT) mice were supplemented with or without NaHS (30 microM/L, H(2)S donor) in drinking water. Blood flow and cerebral microvascular permeability in pial vessels were measured by intravital microscopy in WT, WT+NaHS, CBS-/+ and (CBS-/+)+NaHS-treated mice. The brain tissues were analyzed for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) by Western blot and RT-PCR. The mRNA levels of CBS and cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE, enzyme responsible for conversion of Hcy to H(2)S) genes were measured by RT-PCR. The results showed a significant increase in MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-3 protein and mRNA in CBS (-/+) mice, while H(2)S treatment mitigated this increase. Interstitial localization of MMPs was also apparent through immunohistochemistry. A decrease in protein and mRNA expression of TIMP-4 was observed in CBS (-/+) mice. Microscopy data revealed increase in permeability in CBS (-/+) mice. These effects were ameliorated by H(2)S and suggested that physiological levels of H(2)S supplementation may have therapeutic potential against HHcy-induced microvascular permeability, in part, by normalizing the MMP/TIMP ratio in the brain.

Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HVC), an intrinsic and assumed ubiquitous response of mammalian pulmonary blood vessels, matches regional ventilation to perfusion via an unknown O(2)-sensing mechanism. Global pulmonary hypoxia experienced by individuals suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or numerous hypoventilation syndromes, including sleep apnea, often produces maladaptive pulmonary hypertension, but pulmonary hypertension is not observed in diving mammals, where profound hypoxia is routine. Here we examined the response of cow and sea lion pulmonary arteries (PA) to hypoxia and observed the expected HVC in the former and a unique hypoxic vasodilation in resistance vessels in the latter. We then used this disparate response to examine the O(2)-sensing mechanism. In both animals, exogenous H(2)S mimicked the vasoactive effects of hypoxia in isolated PA. H(2)S-synthesizing enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase, cystathionine gamma-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase, were identified in lung tissue from both animals by one-dimensional Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The relationship between H(2)S production/consumption and O(2) was examined in real time by use of amperometric H(2)S and O(2) sensors. H(2)S was produced by sea lion and cow lung homogenate in the absence of O(2), but it was rapidly consumed when O(2) was present. Furthermore, consumption of exogenous H(2)S by cow lung homogenate, PA smooth muscle cells, and heart mitochondria was O(2) dependent and exhibited maximal sensitivity at physiologically relevant Po(2) levels. These studies show that HVC is not an intrinsic property of PA and provide further evidence for O(2)-dependent H(2)S metabolism in O(2) sensing.

Genetic or nutritional disorders in homocysteine (Hcy) or folate metabolism elevate plasma Hcy-thiolactone and lead to vascular and/or brain pathologies. Hcy-thiolactone has the ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues, which generates N-Hcy-protein with autoimmunogenic and prothrombotic properties. Paraoxonase (PON1), carried on high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in the blood, hydrolyzes Hcy-thiolactone and protects against the accumulation of N-Hcy-protein in vitro. To determine its role in vivo, we studied how natural variation in Hcy-thiolactonase activity of PON1 affects plasma N-Hcy-protein levels in cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient patients (n=28). We found that plasma N-Hcy-protein was negatively correlated with serum Hcy-thiolactonase activity (r=-0.43, P=0.01), i.e., the higher the Hcy-thiolactonase activity, the lower N-Hcy protein levels. This relation was faithfully replicated in vitro in experiments with radiolabeled Hcy-thiolactone. We also found that enzymatic activities of the PON1 protein measured with artificial substrates correlated less strongly (r=-0.36, P=0.025 for paraoxonase activity) or did not correlate at all (phenylacetate hydrolase and TBLase activities) with plasma N-Hcy protein. These findings provide evidence that the Hcy-thiolactonase activity of PON1 is a determinant of plasma N-Hcy-protein levels and that Hcy-thiolactonase/PON1 protects proteins against N-homocysteinylation in vivo, a novel mechanism likely to contribute to atheroprotective roles of HDL in humans.-Perla-Kaján, J., Jakubowski, H. Paraoxonase 1 protects against protein N-homocysteinylation in humans.

Three hundred years have passed since the first description of the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S). Three papers in 1989 and 1990 described relatively high concentrations of sulfide in the brain. In 1996 we demonstrated that cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a H(2)S producing enzyme in the brain and that H(2)S enhances the activity of NMDA receptors and facilitates the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic model of memory. In the following year, we demonstrated that another H(2)S producing enzyme, cystathionine gamma-lyase is in the thoracic aorta, portal vein, and the ileum, and that H(2)S relaxes these tissues. Based on these observations we proposed H(2)S as a neuromodulator as well as a smooth muscle relaxant. We recently demonstrated that the third H(2)S-producing enzyme, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) along with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) produces H(2)S in the brain as well as in vascular endothelium. Various functions in many tissues have been proposed. H(2)S protects neurons and cardiac muscle from oxidative stress. H(2)S has pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, nociceptive effects, the regulatory function of insulin release, and is even involved in longevity. Recent progress in the studies of physiological functions of H(2)S in neurons and smooth muscle was described.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is an essential physiological product in brain. We investigated the expression of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CGL), the two H(2)S synthesizing enzymes, in human cell lines and in human brain. Only astrocytes were strongly immunostained for CBS. Cultured astrocytes synthesized H(2)S at the rate of 15.06 micromol/g protein/h, which was 7.57 fold higher than microglial cells, 10.27 fold higher than SH-SY5Y cells and 11.32 fold higher than NT-2 cells. The H(2)S synthesis in all these cell types was inhibited by the CBS inhibitor hydroxylamine, but not by the CGL inhibitor propargylglycine (PAG). Synthesis of H(2)S by HUVEC cells was inhibited by PAG but not by hydroxylamine indicating that these vascular cells utilize CGL but not CBS. Inflammatory activation of microglia and astrocytes caused induction of NFkappaB, release of the inflammatory mediators TNFalpha, IL-6 and nitrite ions, down-regulation of CBS, and down-regulation of H(2)S synthesis. There was no effect of such treatment on HUVEC cells. The effects were partially reversed by pretreatment of cells with the H(2)S releasing agent NaSH. These data indicate that H(2)S is an endogenous antiinflammatory and neuroprotective agent under the synthetic control of CBS. H(2)S releasing drugs may have therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders of aging such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease.

Elevated homocysteine (Hcy) plasma levels are caused by genetic and environmental factors. Polymorphisms of Hcy metabolizing enzyme genes may result in its plasma increase. Experimental and clinical studies have shown the possible role of hyperhomocysteinaemia in pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease and vascular disorders. The results of clinical studies in PD generally do not support the theoretical hypotheses, and animal studies remain controversial. A major environmental factor responsible for Hcy increase in PD seems to be levodopa therapy. Its metabolism results in Hcy increase and may be reduced with folate and vitamins B6, B12 supplementation or inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity. Therefore, the potential harmful role of Hcy may be diminished in PD patients with vascular comorbidities. Further studies are needed to establish the real role of Hcy for PD and other neurological disorders. The paper summarizes the current knowledge on the genetic and environmental factors responsible for Hcy increase in PD.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has been recognized as a smooth muscle relaxant. Cystathionine gamma-lyase, which is localized to smooth muscle, is thought to be the major H(2)S-producing enzyme in the thoracic aorta. Here we show that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) are localized to vascular endothelium in the thoracic aorta and produce H(2)S. Both 3MST and CAT were localized to endothelium. Lysates of vascular endothelial cells produced H(2)S from cysteine and alpha-ketoglutarate. The present study provides a new insight into the production and release of H(2)S as a smooth muscle relaxant from vascular endothelium.

The first endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) ever identified is a gasotransmitter, nitric oxide (NO). Recent studies have provided several lines of evidence to support the premise that hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), another gasotransmitter, is a new EDRF. H(2)S production is catalyzed in mammalian cells by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and/or cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). The expression of CSE proteins and the activity of CBS have been observed in vascular endothelial cells. A measurable amount of H(2)S is produced from endothelium upon muscarinic cholinergic stimulation. The endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by H(2)S shares many common mechanistic traits with those of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Deficiency in CSE expression increases blood pressure in CSE knockout mice and significantly diminishes endothelium-dependent relaxation of resistance arteries. More extensive and mechanistic studies in the future will help to determine whether H(2)S is a new EDRF or the very EDHF.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a gaseous messenger and serves as an important neuromodulator in the central nervous system. The current study was undertaken to investigate whether H(2)S attenuates the neuronal injury induced by vascular dementia (VD). Rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery and vertebral artery occlusion for 5 min three times in an interval of 5 min to induce VD. An H(2)S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) or an inhibitor of cystathionine-beta-synthase, hydroxylamine (HA) was administered intraperitoneally. The number of neurons in the hippocampus was determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the performance of learning and memory was tested by the Morris water maze. H(2)S content in plasma was evaluated. Apoptosis in the hippocampus was assessed by flow cytometry. In addition, Bcl-2 and Bax expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The neuronal injury occurred gradually with a decreased number of neurons and increased apoptosis ratio in the hippocampus over 720 h after VD. The H(2)S level was also gradually decreased in plasma over 720 h after VD, which negatively correlated with the apoptosis ratio in the hippocampus after VD. In addition, NaHS treatment significantly attenuated neuronal injury and improved neural functional performance, whereas HA exaggerated the neuronal injury and exacerbated learning and memory at 720 h after VD. Furthermore, NaHS treatment markedly improved the ratio of Bcl-2 over Bax with increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax expression. In contrast, HA reduced the ratio of Bcl-2 over Bax. It is suggested that H(2)S attenuates VD injury via inhibiting apoptosis and may have potential therapeutic value for VD.

The role of the plasma level of homocysteine (Hcy), as a primary outcome, and the effect of silent cerebrovascular lesions and genetic variants related to Hcy metabolism, as secondary outcomes, in the cognitive decline and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied. This case-control study focused on 89 PD patients of minimum 10 years of evolution and older than 60 years, who were neuropsychologically classified either as cognitively normal (n = 37), having mild cognitive impairment (Petersen criteria) (n = 22), or suffering from dementia (DSM-IV) (n = 30), compared with cognitively normal age-matched control subjects (n = 30). Plasma levels of Hcy, vitamins B12 and B6, folic acid, polymorphisms in genes related to Hcy metabolism (MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, and CBS) and silent cerebrovascular events were analyzed. Plasma levels of Hcy were increased in PD patients (P = 0.0001). There were no differences between the groups of patients. The brain vascular burden was similar among PD groups. There was no association between polymorphisms in the studied genes and the Hcy plasma levels or cognitive status in PD patients. We found no evidence for a direct relationship between Hcy plasma levels and cognitive impairment and dementia in PD. No indirect effect through cerebrovascular disease or genetic background was found either.

The gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is emerging as a novel regulator of important physiologic functions such as arterial diameter, blood flow and leukocyte adhesion. In addition, it may have antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. H2S has recently attracted much interest as a potent vasorelaxative substance that may establish itself alongside another gaseous signal molecule, nitric oxide (NO). In contrast to NO, the major source of H2S in blood may be production by red blood cells or by vascular smooth muscle cells. H2S is produced from cysteine, involving the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). The importance of CSE was recently demonstrated in a mouse lacking CSE which showed reduced H2S levels and developed hypertension and reduced endothelium-mediated vasorelaxation. These data establish H2S as a new and important biologic signal molecule and as a new regulator of vascular blood flow and blood pressure.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a well known and pungent toxic gas that has recently been shown to be synthesised in man from the amino acids cystathionine, homocysteine and cysteine by at least two distinct enzymes; cystathionine-gamma-lyase and cystathionine-beta-synthase. In the past few years, H(2)S has emerged as a novel and increasingly important mediator in the cardiovascular system but delineating the precise physiology and pathophysiology of H(2)S is proving to be complex and difficult to unravel with disparate findings reported with cell types, tissue types and animal species reported. Therefore, in this review we summarize the mechanisms by which H(2)S has been proposed to regulate blood pressure and cardiac function, discuss the mechanistic discrepancies reported in the literature as well as the therapeutic potential of H(2)S. We also examine the methods of H2S detection in biological fluids, processes for H(2)S removal and discuss the reported blood levels of H(2)S in man and animal models of cardiovascular pathology. We also highlight the complex interaction of H(2)S with nitric oxide in regulating cardiovascular function in health and disease.

Accumulating evidence suggests that homocysteine (Hcy) metabolite, the thioester Hcy-thiolactone, plays an important role in atherothrombosis. Hcy-thiolactone is a product of an error-editing reaction in protein biosynthesis which forms when Hcy is mistakenly selected by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The thioester chemistry of Hcy-thiolactone underlies its ability to from isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues, which impairs or alters protein's function. Protein targets for the modification by Hcy-thiolactone include fibrinogen, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, albumin, hemoglobin, and ferritin. Pathophysiological consequences of protein N-homocysteinylation include protein and cell damage, activation of an adaptive immune response and synthesis of auto-antibodies against N-Hcy-proteins, and enhanced thrombosis caused by N-Hcy-fibrinogen. Recent development of highly sensitive chemical and immunohistochemical assays has allowed verification of the hypothesis that the Hcy-thiolactone pathway contributes to pathophysiology of the vascular system, in particular of the prediction that conditions predisposing to atherosclerosis, such as genetic or dietary hyperhomocysteinemia, lead to elevation of Hcy-thiolactone and N-Hcy-protein. This prediction has been confirmed in vivo both in humans and in mice. For example, plasma Hcy-thiolactone was found to be elevated 59-72-fold in human patients with hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) or cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) genes. Plasma N-Hcy-protein levels are elevated 24-30-fold in MTHFR- or CBS-deficiency, both in human patients and in mice. Plasma and urinary Hcy-thiolactone and plasma N-Hcy-protein levels are also elevated up to 30-fold in mice fed a hyperhomocysteinemic (1.5% methionine) diet. Furthermore, plasma levels of prothromobogenic N-Hcy-fibrinogen were elevated in human CBS deficiency, which explains increased atherothrombosis observed in CBS-deficient patients. We also observed increased immunohistochemical staining for N-Hcy-protein in aortic lesions from ApoE-deficient mice with hyperhomocysteinemia induced by a high methionine diet, relative to the mice fed a normal chow diet. We conclude that genetic or dietary hyperhomocysteinemia significantly elevates proatherothrombotic metabolites Hcy-thiolactone and N-Hcy-proteins in humans and mice.

Although there is a growing recognition of the significance of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) as a biological signaling molecule involved in vascular and nervous system functions, its biogenesis and regulation are poorly understood. It is widely assumed that desulfhydration of cysteine is the major source of H(2)S in mammals and is catalyzed by the transsulfuration pathway enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). In this study, we demonstrate that the profligacy of human CSE results in a variety of reactions that generate H(2)S from cysteine and homocysteine. The gamma-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of homocysteine, yields H(2)S and a novel biomarker, homolanthionine, which has been reported in urine of homocystinuric patients, whereas a beta-replacement reaction, which condenses two molecules of cysteine, generates lanthionine. Kinetic simulations at physiologically relevant concentrations of cysteine and homocysteine, reveal that the alpha,beta-elimination of cysteine accounts for approximately 70% of H(2)S generation. However, the relative importance of homocysteine-derived H(2)S increases progressively with the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia, and under conditions of severely elevated homocysteine (200 microm), the alpha,gamma-elimination and gamma-replacement reactions of homocysteine together are predicted to account for approximately 90% of H(2)S generation by CSE. Excessive H(2)S production in hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to the associated cardiovascular pathology.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), a novel endogenous gaseous bioactive substance, has recently been implicated in the regulation of cardiovascular and neuronal functions. However, its role in the control of renal function is unknown. In the present study, incubation of renal tissue homogenates with L-cysteine (L-Cys) (as a substrate) produced H(2)S in a concentration-dependent manner. This H(2)S production was completely abolished by inhibition of both cystathionine beta-synthetase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL), two major enzymes for the production of H(2)S, using amino-oxyacetic acid (AOAA), an inhibitor of CBS, and propargylglycine (PPG), an inhibitor of CGL. However, inhibition of CBS or CGL alone induced a small decrease in H(2)S production. In anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, intrarenal arterial infusion of an H(2)S donor (NaHS) increased renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary sodium (U(Na) x V), and potassium (U(K) x V) excretion. Consistently, infusion of both AOAA and PPG to inhibit the endogenous H(2)S production decreased GFR, U(Na) x V, and U(K) x V, and either one of these inhibitors alone had no significant effect on renal functions. Infusion of L-Cys into renal artery to increase the endogenous H(2)S production also increased GFR, U(Na) x V, and U(K) x V, which was blocked by AOAA plus PPG. It was shown that H(2)S had both vascular and tubular effects and that the tubular effect of H(2)S might be through inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter and Na(+)/K(+)/ATPase activity. These results suggest that H(2)S participates in the control of renal function and increases urinary sodium excretion via both vascular and tubular actions in the kidney.

Genetic disorders of homocysteine (Hcy) or folate metabolism or high-methionine diets elevate plasma Hcy and its atherogenic metabolite Hcy-thiolactone. In humans, severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to genetic alterations in cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs) or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr) results in neurological abnormalities and premature death from vascular complications. In mouse models, dietary or genetic hyperhomocysteinemia results in liver or brain pathological changes and accelerates atherosclerosis. Hcy-thiolactone has the ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues, which generates modified proteins (N-Hcy-protein) with autoimmunogenic and prothrombotic properties. Our aim was to determine how N-Hcy-protein levels are affected by genetic or nutritional disorders in Hcy or folate metabolism in mice. We found that plasma N-Hcy-protein was elevated 10-fold in mice fed a high-methionine diet compared with the animals fed a normal commercial diet. We also found that inactivation of Cbs, Mthfr, or the proton-coupled folate transporter (Pcft) gene resulted in a 10- to 30-fold increase in plasma or serum N-Hcy-protein levels. Liver N-Hcy-protein was elevated 3.4-fold in severely and 11-fold in extremely hyperhomocysteinemic Cbs-deficient mice, 3.6-fold in severely hyperhomocysteinemic Pcft mice, but was not elevated in mildly hyperhomocysteinemic Mthfr-deficient animals, suggesting that mice have a capacity to prevent accumulation of N-Hcy-protein in their organs. These findings provide evidence that N-Hcy-protein is an important metabolite associated with Hcy pathophysiology in the mouse.

The clinical features consist in: ophthalmic, neurological, orthopedic and vascular manifestations. It is generally diagnosed in childhood. Vascular involvements characterize adult's forms. We report one case.OBSERVATION: A 26-year-old man, who has lentis ectopia and a recent epilepsy, was hospitalized for deep vein thrombosis. Regarding the marfanoid phenotype and the high level homocysteinemia (231 micromol/L), homocysteinuria was suspected. Amino acid chromatography and reduced CBS activity were used to confirm the diagnosis. Vitamin enriched diet with vitamin B6 and folates has reduced slightly the homocysteine level.CONCLUSION: Homocysteinuria must be diagnosed early since a simple vitamin supply could ameliorate prognosis and decrease complications.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is characterized by an increase of plasma homocysteine, a thiol-containing amino acid produced during methionine metabolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia has often been associated with coronary artery disease, vascular thrombosis and the development of premature atherosclerosis. We have recently demonstrated that the supplementation of catechin, a polyphenol found in the red wine, significantly reduced plasma homocysteine level in cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficient mice, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of another well-studied polyphenol found in red wine, resveratrol, on hyperhomocysteinemia. After two months on high methionine diet, heterozygous Cbs deficient mice were administrated the resveratrol in drinking water (0.001%) for one month. High methionine diet significantly increased serum homocysteine levels, and decreased the serum activity of HDL-associated enzyme paraoxonase-1. Chronic administration of resveratrol significantly increased plasma homocysteine level, which was associated with a decreased serum paraoxonase-1 activity, in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Then we looked at gene expression of several proteins involved in HDL stability and found a down-regulation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. In conclusion, we found a deleterious effect of resveratrol onto homocysteine and HDL metabolism in a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia.

Increased levels of homocysteine (Hcy), recognized as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), were associated with cardiovascular diseases. There was controversy regarding the detrimental versus cardio protective role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in ischemic heart disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the Hcy generated nitrotyrosine by inducing the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, causing endothelial-myocyte (E-M) coupling. To differentiate the role of iNOS versus constitutive nitric oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) in Hcy-mediated nitrotyrosine generation and matrix remodeling in cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular (LV) tissue was analyzed from cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) heterozygote knockout, iNOS homozygote knockout, CBS-/+/iNOS-/- double knockout, and wild-type (WT) mice. The levels of nitrotyrosine, MMP-2 and -9 (zymographic analysis), and fibrosis (by trichrome stain) were measured. The endothelial-myocyte function was determined in cardiac rings. In CBS-/+ mice, homocysteine was elevated and in iNOS-/- mice, nitric oxide was significantly reduced. The nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels were elevated in double knockout and CBS-/+ as compared to WT mice. Although MMP-2 levels were similar in CBS-/+, iNOS-/-, and CBS-/+/iNOS-/-, the levels were three- to fourfold higher than WT. The levels of collagen were similar in CBS-/+ and iNOS-/-, but they were threefold higher than WT. Interesting, the levels of collagen increased sixfold in double knockouts, compared to WT, suggesting synergism between high Hcy and lack of iNOS. Left ventricular hypertrophy was exaggerated in the iNOS-/- and double knockout, and mildly increased in the CBS-/+, compared to WT mice. The endothelial-dependent relaxation was attenuated to the same extent in the CBS-/+ and iNOS-/-, compared to WT, but it was robustly blunted in double knockouts. The results concluded that homocysteine generated nitrotyrosine in the vicinity of endothelium, caused MMP activation and endothelium-myocyte uncoupling. The generation of nitrotyrosine was independent of iNOS.

Untreated cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency in humans is characterized by extremely elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy&gt;200 microM), with thrombosis as the major cause of morbidity. Treatment with vitamins and diet leads to a dramatic reduction in thrombotic events, even though patients often still have severe elevations in tHcy (&gt;80 microM). To understand the difference between extreme and severe hyperhomocysteinemia, we have examined two mouse models of CBS deficiency: Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice, with a mean serum tHcy of 169 microM, and Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice, with a mean tHcy of 296 microM. Only Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) animals exhibited strong biological phenotypes, including facial alopecia, osteoporosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver and kidney, and a 20% reduction in mean survival time. Metabolic profiling of serum and liver reveals that Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice have significantly elevated levels of free oxidized homocysteine but not protein-bound homocysteine in serum and elevation of all forms of homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in the liver compared to Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice. RNA profiling of livers indicate that Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) and Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice have unique gene signatures, with minimal overlap. Our results indicate that there is a clear pathogenic threshold effect for tHcy and bring into question the idea that mild elevations in tHcy are directly pathogenic.

Hepatic blood supply is uniquely regulated by the hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR), counteracting alterations of portal venous blood flow by flow changes of the hepatic artery. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has been recognized as a novel signaling molecule with vasoactive properties. However, the contribution of H(2)S in mediating the HABR is not yet studied. In pentobarbital-anesthetized and laparotomized rats, flow probes around the portal vein and hepatic artery allowed for assessment of the portal venous (PVBF) and hepatic arterial blood flow (HABF) under baseline conditions and stepwise reduction of PVBF for induction of HABR. Animals received either the H(2)S donor Na(2)S, DL-propargylglycine as inhibitor of the H(2)S synthesizing enzyme cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE), or saline alone. Additionally, animals were treated with Na(2)S and the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP)) inhibitor glibenclamide or with glibenclamide alone. Na(2)S markedly increased the buffer capacity to 27.4 +/- 3.0% (P &lt; 0.05 vs. controls: 15.5 +/- 1.7%), whereas blockade of H(2)S formation by DL-propargylglycine significantly reduced the buffer capacity (8.5 +/- 1.4%). Glibenclamide completely reversed the H(2)S-induced increase of buffer capacity to the control level. By means of RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry, we observed the expression of both H(2)S synthesizing enzymes (CSE and cystathionine-beta-synthase) in aorta, vena cava, hepatic artery, and portal vein, as well as in hepatic parenchymal tissue. Terminal branches of the hepatic afferent vessels expressed only CSE. We show for the first time that CSE-derived H(2)S contributes to HABR and partly mediates vasorelaxation of the hepatic artery via activation of K(ATP) channels.

The last couple of years have witnessed the coming together of several initially unconnected lines of investigation which now link natural sulfur products to hydrogen sulfide release and wide ranging cardiovascular protection. It has become apparent that sulfur compounds contained within garlic, onions, mushrooms and various edible beans and fruits may be transformed chemically or enzymatically in the human body with subsequent formation of hydrogen sulfide. The latter has emerged during the last decade from a shadowy existence as toxic gas to be recognized as the third gaseous transmitter besides nitric oxide ( (.)NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Hydrogen sulfide is formed endogenously in the human body by enzymes such as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) in the brain and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) in liver, vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle. Although its exact chemical and biochemical modes of action are still not fully understood, levels of hydrogen sulfide in the brain and vasculature have unambiguously been associated with human health and disease. Not surprisingly, agents releasing hydrogen sulfide, as well as inhibitors of hydrogen sulfide synthesis (CBS and CSE inhibitors) have been investigated. Apart from linking our daily diet to a healthy brain and cardiovasculature, these findings may also provide new leads for drug design. Future studies will therefore need to focus on how such compounds are formed and transformed in the relevant plants, how food processing affects their chemical constitution, and how they release hydrogen sulfide (or control its levels) in the human body. Such multidisciplinary research should ultimately answer the all-important question if a hearty diet is also good for the heart.

AIMS: Sodium thiosulfate (STS) has been shown to be an antioxidant and calcium solubilizer, but the possible role of STS in dysfunctional ventricles remains unknown. Here, we assessed the effects of STS in the failing heart.METHODS: Heart failure was created by an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Mice were divided into 4 groups: sham, AVF, sham + STS, and AVF + STS. STS (3 mg/ml) was supplemented with drinking water for 6 weeks in the appropriate surgery groups after surgery.RESULTS: M-mode echocardiograms showed ventricular contractile dysfunction with reduced aortic blood flow in AVF mice, whereas STS treatment prevented the decline in cardiac function. Ventricular collagen, MMP-2 and -9, and TIMP-1 were robustly increased with a decreasing trend in adenylate cyclase VI expression; however, STS supplementation reversed these effects in AVF mice. Among 2 enzymes that produce endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) expression was attenuated in AVF mice with no changes in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) expression. In addition, reduced production of H(2)S in AVF ventricular tissue was normalized with STS supplementation. Moreover, cardiac tissues were more responsive to H(2)S when AVF mice were supplemented with STS compared to AVF alone.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that STS modulated cardiac dysfunction and the extracellular matrix, in part, by increasing ventricular H(2)S generation.

A two year-old male child presented with cutis marmorata congenita universalis, brittle hair, mild mental retardation, and finger spasms. Biochemical findings include increased levels of homocysteine in the blood-106.62 micromol/L (normal levels: 5.90-16 micromol/L). Biochemical tests such as the silver nitroprusside and nitroprusside tests were positive suggesting homocystinuria. The patient was treated with oral pyridoxine therapy for three months. The child responded well to this therapy and the muscle spasms as well as skin manifestations such as cutis marmorata subsided. The treatment is being continued; the case is reported here because of its rarity. Homocysteinuria arising due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of methionine metabolism that produces increased levels of urinary homocysteine and methionine It manifests itself in vascular, central nervous system, cutaneous, and connective tissue disturbances and phenotypically resembles Marfan's syndrome. Skin manifestations include malar flush, thin hair, and cutis reticulata / marmorata.

An elevated level of Homocysteine (Hcy) is a risk factor for vascular dementia and stroke. Cysthathionine beta Synthase (CBS) gene is involved in the clearance of Hcy. Homozygous individuals for (CBS-/-) die early, but heterozygous for (CBS-/+) survive with high levels of Hcy. The gamma-Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) presents in the central nervous system (CNS) and functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Hcy competes with GABA at the GABA(A) receptor and affects the CNS function. We hypothesize that Hcy causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain due to increase in vascular resistance (VR) because of arterial remodeling in the carotid artery (CA). Blood pressure and blood flow in CA of wild type (WT), CBS-/+, CBS-/+ GABA(A)-/- double knockout, and GABA(A)-/- were measured. CA was stained with trichrome, and the brain permeability was measured. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-3, TIMP-4), elastin, and collagen-III expression were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results showed an increase in VR in CBS-/+/GABA(A)-/-double knockout&gt;CBS-/+/&gt;GABA(A)-/- compared to WT mice. Increased MMP-2, MMP-9, collagen-III and TIMP-3 mRNA levels were found in GABA(A)-/-, CBS-/+, CBS-/+/GABA(A) double knockout compared to WT. The levels of TIMP-4 and elastin were decreased, whereas the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-3 increased, which indirectly reflected the arterial resistance. These results suggested that Hcy caused arterial remodeling in part, by increase in collagen/elastin ratio thereby increasing VR leading to the decrease in CA blood flow.

Severely elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels observed in genetic disorders of Hcy metabolism are associated with pathologies in multiple organs and lead to premature death due to vascular complications. In addition to elevating plasma Hcy, mutations in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene lead to markedly elevated levels of circulating Hcy-thiolactone. The thiooester chemistry of Hcy-thiolactone underlies its ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues (N-Hcy-protein), which may impair or alter the protein's function. However, it was not known whether genetic deficiencies in Hcy metabolism affect N-Hcy-protein levels in humans. Here we show that plasma N-Hcy-protein levels are significantly elevated in CBS- and MTHFR-deficient patients. We also show that CBS-deficient patients have significantly elevated plasma levels of prothrombotic N-Hcy-fibrinogen. These results provide a possible explanation for increased atherothrombosis observed in CBS-deficient patients.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, or abnormally high plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration, has often been associated with vascular thrombosis and the development of premature atherosclerosis. Many studies have shown that moderate wine consumption has potential beneficial effects related to the prevention of atherosclerosis, in part attributed to the biological properties of polyphenolic components, mainly flavonoids. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of a red wine polyphenolic extract (PE) administration on hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency and on the associated biochemical markers of hepatic and endothelial dysfunctions in mice. Red wine PE was added for 4 weeks to the drinking water of heterozygous CBS-deficient mice fed a high-methionine diet, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. Red wine PE supplementation at low dose significantly reduced plasma Hcy levels and restored the hepatic and plasma-decreased paraoxonase-1 activity induced by chronic hyperhomocysteinemia. Moreover, aortic expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules and levels of soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 were reduced in hyperhomocysteinemic mice fed the red wine PE supplementation. These findings suggest that red wine PE administration in low quantities has beneficial effects on biochemical markers of endothelial dysfunction due to hyperhomocysteinemia.

PURPOSE: Isotretinoin (Iso) has marked side effects. Homocysteine (Hcy) metabolizes in the liver, requiring folate and vitamin B12. Elevated blood levels of Hcy have been linked to an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we evaluated Hcy levels, vitamin B12, and folate in patients on Iso treatment for cystic acne (CA).METHODS: Seventy-four patients with CA were included to the study group. Blood levels of Hcy, vitamin B12, and folate were assessed before and after 45 days of Iso therapy. The control group consisting of 80 individuals were tested once.RESULTS: Hcy levels were statistically significantly increased in patients on Iso treatment. Vitamins were unaltered, while lipids and liver enzymes increased statistically significantly.CONCLUSION: Hcy levels are elevated in patients on Iso treatment for CA. It may be due to either the inhibition of cystathionine-beta-synthase, an enzyme required in the metabolism of Hcy, by the drug and/or the liver dysfunction. Daily supplementation with vitamin B12 and folate, which are the cofactors of the enzymatic reactions involved in Hcy metabolism, can lower plasma levels of Hcy, so it is recommended to take these vitamins in case of deficiency along with Iso to prevent premature occlusive vascular disease.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has been proposed to mediate hypoxic vasoconstriction (HVC), however, other studies suggest the vasoconstrictory effect indirectly results from an oxidation product of H(2)S. Here we examined the relationship between H(2)S and O(2) in isolated hagfish and lamprey vessels that exhibit profound hypoxic vasoconstriction. In myographic studies, H(2)S (Na(2)S) dose-dependently constricted dorsal aortas (DA) and efferent branchial arteries (EBA) but did not affect ventral aortas or afferent branchial arteries; effects similar to those produced by hypoxia. Sensitivity of H(2)S-mediated contraction in hagfish and lamprey DA was enhanced by hypoxia. HVC in hagfish DA was enhanced by the H(2)S precursor cysteine and inhibited by amino-oxyacetate, an inhibitor of the H(2)S-synthesizing enzyme, cystathionine beta-synthase. HVC was unaffected by propargyl glycine, an inhibitor of cystathionine lambda-lyase. Oxygen consumption (M(O(2))) of hagfish DA was constant between 15 and 115 mmHg P(O(2)) (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), decreased when P(O(2)) &lt;15 mmHg, and increased after P(O(2)) exceeded 115 mmHg. 10 micromol l(-1) H(2)S increased and &gt; or =100 micromol l(-1) H(2)S decreased M(O(2)). Consistent with the effects on HVC, cysteine increased and amino-oxyacetate decreased M(O(2)). These results show that H(2)S is a monophasic vasoconstrictor of specific cyclostome vessels and because hagfish lack vascular NO, and vascular sensitivity to H(2)S was enhanced at low P(O(2)), it is unlikely that H(2)S contractions are mediated by either H(2)S-NO interaction or an oxidation product of H(2)S. These experiments also provide additional support for the hypothesis that the metabolism of H(2)S is involved in oxygen sensing/signal transduction in vertebrate vascular smooth muscle.

A novel concept of &quot;gasotransmitter&quot; arrived recently. They are small molecules of endogenous gases. Hydrogene sulfide (H2S) is qualified as the third gasotransmitter beside nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). The physiological functions of endogenous H2S are not well-known. The location of the H2S synthetizing enzymes as well as the detector of endogenous levels of H2S in the tissues suggests that the cardiovascular system is a source of H2S generation. This gas relaxes vascular smooth muscle both in vitro and in vivo probably by opening smooth K+ATP channels. Being a reducing agent, H2S may alter cellular redox status. It is able to produce thiyls free radicals: SH degrees and S degrees . The advances in H2S researchs may revolutionize many conventional doctrines in the cardiovascular area.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, has been proposed to be a mediator of vascular dysfunction during hyperhomocysteinemia. Levels of ADMA are regulated by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, we tested the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia causes downregulation of the two genes encoding DDAH (Ddah1 and Ddah2). In the MS-1 murine endothelial cell line, the addition of homocysteine decreased NO production but did not elevate ADMA or alter levels of Ddah1 or Ddah2 mRNA. Mice heterozygous for cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs) and their wild-type littermates were fed either a control diet or a high-methionine/low-folate (HM/LF) diet to produce varying degrees of hyperhomocysteinemia. Maximal relaxation of the carotid artery to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine was decreased by approximately 50% in Cbs(+/-) mice fed the HM/LF diet compared with Cbs(+/+) mice fed the control diet (P &lt; 0.001). Compared with control mice, hyperhomocysteinemic mice had lower levels of Ddah1 mRNA in the liver (P &lt; 0.001) and lower levels of Ddah2 mRNA in the liver, lung, and kidney (P &lt; 0.05). Downregulation of DDAH expression in hyperhomocysteinemic mice did not result in an increase in plasma ADMA, possibly due to a large decrease in hepatic methylation capacity (S-adenosylmethionine-to-S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio). Our findings demonstrate that hyperhomocysteinemia causes tissue-specific decreases in DDAH expression without altering plasma ADMA levels in mice with endothelial dysfunction.

O2 chemoreceptors elicit cardiorespiratory reflexes in all vertebrates, but consensus on O2-sensing signal transduction mechanism(s) is lacking. We recently proposed that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) metabolism is involved in O2 sensing in vascular smooth muscle. Here, we examined the possibility that H2S is an O2 sensor in trout chemoreceptors where the first pair of gills is a primary site of aquatic O2 sensing and the homolog of the mammalian carotid body. Intrabuccal injection of H2S in unanesthetized trout produced a dose-dependent bradycardia and increased ventilatory frequency and amplitude similar to the hypoxic response. Removal of the first, but not second, pair of gills significantly inhibited H2S-mediated bradycardia, consistent with the loss of aquatic chemoreceptors. mRNA for H2S-synthesizing enzymes, cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase, was present in branchial tissue. Homogenized gills produced H2S enzymatically, and H2S production was inhibited by O2, whereas mitochondrial H2S consumption was O2 dependent. Ambient hypoxia did not affect plasma H2S in unanesthetized trout, but produced a PO2-dependent increase in a sulfide moiety suggestive of increased H2S production. In isolated zebrafish neuroepithelial cells, the putative chemoreceptive cells of fish, both hypoxia and H2S, produced a similar approximately 10-mV depolarization. These studies are consistent with H2S involvement in O2 sensing/signal transduction pathway(s) in chemoreceptive cells, as previously demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle. This novel mechanism, whereby H2S concentration ([H2S]) is governed by the balance between constitutive production and oxidation, tightly couples tissue [H2S] to PO2 and may provide an exquisitely sensitive, yet simple, O2 sensor in a variety of tissues.

Down syndrome is a chromosome abnormality with specific clinical symptoms and mental retardation caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. The basic genetic change cannot be cured, the control of the associated symptoms, however, may improve the patients' quality of life.</AbstractText>: Down syndrome is a chromosome abnormality with specific clinical symptoms and mental retardation caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. The basic genetic change cannot be cured, the control of the associated symptoms, however, may improve the patients' quality of life.AIMS: Authors studied the possible correlations between the Down-specific genes and the related biochemical changes. Expression of superoxide dismutase, cystathionine-beta-synthase and S100 protein was investigated. Further aim of the study was to determine the total serum antioxidant capacity (transferrin, ferritin, total protein, albumin and bilirubin) along with the extracellular antioxidants as well as concentrations of homocysteine, folic acid, and vitamin B 12 . To assess the vascular damage, the activity of NAG and S100B level was measured.METHODS: Standard laboratory methods were used to determine the antioxidant capacity (Stocks, 1974), homocysteine (HPLC), folic acid (capture, IMX-Abbott), vitamin B 12 (MEIA, IMX-Abbott), S100 B protein (chemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay) levels, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (spectrophotometry).RESULTS: Plasma homocysteine value proved to be lower in 7 of the 30 and higher in 6 of the 30 patients studied than the reference range. Plasma homocysteine was found 95 +/- 21% of the reference value. Relative value of plasma folic acid - expressed in percent of the normal value - was 85 +/- 51%, and that of B 12 was 78 +/- 30%. Deficiency of folic acid was detected in 2 of the 30, decreased level of B 12 in 2 of the 30 patients enrolled. No difference was found in antioxidant activity values between Down syndrome patients and healthy controls, however, neither of them reached the adult reference range. S100 protein concentration of 4-8 times higher values (average value: 0.68 +/- 0.27 microg/l) than upper limit of the reference range was observed (&gt; 1 year: &gt; 0.15 microg/l). Mean value of serum N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase remained within the reference range (10-30 U/l). No statistically significant correlation between the antioxidant activity and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase values could be observed.CONCLUSION: The lower homocysteine, folic acid and B 12 values may be considered as the consequence of an increased cystathionine-beta-synthase activity (&quot;atheroma free model&quot;). There was no significant alteration in antioxidant activity level. It can be supposed that the hydrogene peroxide produced due to increased expression of superoxide dismutase is metabolized by the induced glutathione-peroxidase and catalase keeping by this the balance of the antioxidant system. This hypothesis is supported by the normal N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase values not indicating any vascular damage. The high S100 values, however, reflect certain brain damage which shows a progress with the age. Based on these experiences, regular control of these parameters is recommended. Furthermore authors think that folic acid supplementation is indicated in order to improve the patients' learning capacity, inhibit the development of Alzheimer symptoms and improve the quality of life.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for arterial as well as venous thromboembolism. Individuals with severe hyperhomocysteinemia caused by inherited genetic defects in homocysteine metabolism have an extremely high incidence of vascular thrombosis unless they are treated aggressively with homocysteine-lowering therapy. The clinical value of homocysteine-lowering therapy in individuals with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, which is very common in populations at risk for vascular disease, is more controversial. Considerable progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular thrombotic events has been provided by the development of a variety of murine models. Because levels of homocysteine are regulated by both the methionine and folate cycles, hyperhomocysteinemia can be induced in mice through both genetic and dietary manipulations. Mice deficient in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene have been exploited widely in many studies investigating the vascular pathophysiology of hyperhomocysteinemia. In this article, we review the established murine models, including the CBS-deficient mouse as well as several newer murine models available for the study of hyperhomocysteinemia. We also summarize the major vascular phenotypes observed in these murine models.

Individuals with homozygous deficiency in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) develop high levels of homocysteine in plasma, a condition known as homocysteinuria. Mental retardation ensues with death in teens; the heterozygous live normally but develop vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later part of life. The treatment with muscimol, a gamma amino butyric acid receptor-A (GABA(A)) agonist, mitigates the AD syndrome and vascular dementia. We tested the hypothesis that homocysteine (Hcy) antagonizes the GABA(A) receptor and behaves as an excitotoxic neurotransmitter that causes blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and vascular dementia. The BBB permeability was measured by infusing Evan's blue dye (2% in saline 5 ml/kg concentration) in CBS-/+, GABA(A)-/-, CBS-/+/GABA(A)-/- double knockout, CBS-/+ mice treated with muscimol and wild type (WT) mice. Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP-2, MMP-9), Tissue Inhibitor of Matrix Metalloproteinase (TIMP-3, TIMP-4), collagen-III and elastin levels were measured in whole brain by Western blot. These results suggested an increase in Evan's blue permeability: CBS-/+&lt;GABA(A)-/-&lt;CBS-/+/GABA(A)-/- compared to WT mice. Interestingly, in CBS-/+ mice treated with muscimol, BBB permeability was significantly decreased compared with the CBS-/+ group. There was a decrease in the TIMP-4 protein expression level, whereas the TIMP-3 level increased in CBS-/+, GABA(A)-/-, and CBS-/+/GABA(A)-/- mice compared to the WT. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression significantly increased in all the groups compared to the wild type. The results suggested that Hcy caused cerebral interstitial remodeling in brain by distorting the extracellular matrix, thus increasing the blood brain permeability; treatment with muscimol mitigated BBB permeability.

Cystathionine beta synthase deficiency induces hyperhomocysteinemia which is considered as a risk factor for vascular diseases. Studies underlined the importance of altered cellular redox reactions in hyperhomocysteinemia-induced vascular pathologies. Nevertheless, hyperhomocysteinemia also induces hepatic dysfunction which may accelerate the development of vascular pathologies by modifying cholesterol homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to analyze the modifications of redox state in the liver of heterozygous cystathionine beta synthase-deficient mice, a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia. In this purpose, we quantified levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and we assayed activities of main antioxidant enzymes. We found that cystathionine beta synthase deficiency induced NADPH oxidase activation. However, there was no accumulation of reactive oxygen (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide) and nitrogen (nitrite, peroxynitrite) species. On the contrary, hepatic hydrogen peroxide level was decreased independently of an activation of glutathione-dependent mechanisms. In fact, cystathionine beta synthase deficiency had no effect on glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities. However, we found a 50% increase in hepatic catalase activity without any variation of expression. These findings demonstrate that cystathionine beta synthase deficiency initiates redox disequilibrium in the liver. However, the activation of catalase attenuates oxidative impairments.

Double heterozygous mice lacking one allele of Cbs and Apoa1 develop hyperhomocysteinemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia together with moderate hypertension. To study the influence of the genetic background into this specific phenotype, four groups of male mice were established: control and double heterozygous groups in C57BL/6J and in C57BL/6J x 129 backgrounds, respectively. Nitric oxide levels, systolic blood pressure, plasma lipid parameters, arylesterase activity and aorta histology were analyzed as well as oligonucleotide array hybridization of liver RNA. Results demonstrated that double heterozygous mice in C57BL/6J substrate had a milder phenotype showing lower increase in blood pressure compared to double heterozygous group in hybrid background. The severity of the phenotype in the latter group was associated with lower nitric oxide and arylesterase activity levels, and hyperplasia of the vascular media layer. Hepatic profiling of both genetic substrates showed profound differences in expression of contractile proteins that could explain these pathological findings. In summary, the phenotypic presentation of hypertension is associated with multiple processes from vascular bedside to liver as evidenced by nitric oxide production or paraoxonase levels.

BACKGROUND: Elevated circulating total homocysteine is an independent vascular risk factor. Enzymatic homocysteine measurements represent an alternative to HPLC- or immunochemistry-based assays, suitable for automation. Here, we report on analytical performance of a commercial cystathionine beta-synthase-based assay, for use on Vitros automated analyzers.METHODS: Linear range, limit of detection and analytical sensitivity were inferred from duplicate measurements of homocystine standard solutions (1-65 micromol/L). Imprecision was assessed using commercial controls according to NCCLS EP5-A2 and accuracy using NIST-SRM1955 reference material. Agreement with a clinically validated HPLC method was examined on 207 patient samples.RESULTS: The enzymatic assay was linear from 1 to 90 micromol/L homocysteine. Total (within-day) imprecision ranged from 4.5 (3.9)% to 2.8 (1.6)% at homocysteine 9.7-43.2 micromol/L. Accuracy was acceptable at 8.9 and 17.7 micromol/L homocysteine, with +6.4% and -1.2% bias, respectively, but showed substantial negative bias (-20.1%) at 4.0 micromol/L. High triglycerides (19.8 micromol/L) negatively interfered. The enzymatic method was slightly less sensitive than the HPLC method (limit of detection 0.7 and 0.2 micromol/L, respectively) but correlated well with the latter (r2=0.9997, slope=1.04, intercept=-0.66 micromol/L) and was more precise (p&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The Vitros homocysteine assay met the CLIA Desirable Analytical Quality Specifications at homocysteine &gt; or = 9 micromol/L. Its analytical performance and suitability for automation make the Vitros assay an analytically acceptable alternative to HPLC-based methods.

Double heterozygous mice lacking Apoa1 and Cbs genes show mild hyperhomocysteinemia in combination with hypoalphalipoproteinemia. This situation leads to a moderate hypertension associated with a dysregulation in nitric oxide metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential beneficial effects of statin treatment in these mice. After 4 weeks of simvastatin administration, plasma parameters; apolipoproteins A-I, A-II and A-IV; lipid profile; and blood pressure were assessed, Western blotting was performed in the aorta of these mice to measure endothelial nitric oxide synthase and caveolin-1 content. The high blood pressure level present in the double heterozygous group was corrected down to that of the wild-type group after simvastatin treatment (124+/-7.7 vs. 109+/-11.2 mmHg, p&lt;0.01). Concomitant with this effect, an increase in nitric oxide levels was observed in these double heterozygous mice receiving simvastatin treatment probably mediated in part by a decrease in caveolin-1 levels. Blood pressure changes appeared to be independent of the arylesterase activity of paraoxonase or the lipid content. Another remarkable result was the significant increase in apoA-IV content in animals receiving simvastatin, an effect considered to be protective for the endothelium. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the use of simvastatin can improve blood pressure control in mice with elevated homocysteinemia and low levels of apoA-I, and this effect is mediated by mechanisms independent of plasma lipids and related to nitric oxide levels.

Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS)-deficient patients develop premature arteriosclerosis and thrombosis leading to a high risk of a vascular event before the age of 30 years. In CBS deficiency the transsulfuration pathway is impaired, leading to markedly elevated levels of homocysteine and methionine, and severely decreased levels of cystathionine and cysteine. Through autooxidation these elevated levels of homocysteine might induce excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are involved in endothelial damage and are neutralized by antioxidants. In humans the main antioxidant is glutathione (GSH). Its production mainly depends on the amount of available cysteine. Since cysteine levels in CBS deficiency are decreased, GSH production is presumed to be low. Accordingly, all CBS-deficient patients receive cysteine supplements, which supposedly stimulate GSH synthesis. However, data on the effect of cysteine dosage on GSH synthesis in CBS-deficient patients are lacking. Therefore, in a CBS-deficient pyridoxine non-responsive female patient, concentration and fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of erythrocyte GSH were measured by infusion of l-[3,3-(2)H2]cysteine tracer during prolonged cysteine supplementation with 88 and 40 mg/kg per day. Erythrocyte GSH concentration and its FSR at cysteine supplementation with 88 versus 40 mg/kg per day were 1.25 versus 1.30 mmol/L and 230 versus 254% per day, respectively. These data suggest that in a CBS-deficient patient exogenous supply of 40 mg cysteine/kg per day is sufficient to maintain GSH synthesis in erythrocytes. Further studies in larger patient groups should be initiated to measure the effects on GSH metabolism to further elucidate the correct dose of cysteine supplements in CBS-deficient patients.

Alterations in lipid metabolism may play a role in the vascular pathology associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). Homocysteine is linked to lipid metabolism through the methionine cycle and the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methyltransferase, which is responsible for the synthesis of 20-40% of liver PC. The goal of the present study was to determine if the reduced methylation capacity in HHcy is associated with alterations in liver phospholipid and fatty acid metabolism. Mice heterozygous for disruption of cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs+/-) fed a diet to induce HHcy (HH diet) had higher (p&lt;0.001) plasma total homocysteine (30.8+/-4.4 microM, mean+/-S.E.) than C57BL/6 mice (Cbs+/+) fed the HH diet (7.0+/-1.1 microM) or Cbs+/+ mice fed a control diet (2.3+/-0.3 microM). Mild and moderate HHcy was accompanied by lower adenosylmethionine/adenosylhomocysteine ratios (p&lt;0.05), higher PE (p&lt;0.05) and PE/PC ratios (p&lt;0.01), lower PE methyltransferase activity (p&lt;0.001), and higher linoleic acid (p&lt;0.05) and lower arachidonic acid (p&lt;0.05) in PE. Mice with moderate HHcy also had higher linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid (p&lt;0.05) and lower arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (p&lt;0.05) in liver PC. The first step in the desaturation and elongation of linoleic acid and linolenic acid to arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively, is catalyzed by Delta6-desaturase (encoded by Fads2). We found hypermethylation of the Fads2 promoter (p&lt;0.01), lower Fads2 mRNA (p&lt;0.05), and lower Delta6-desaturase activity (p&lt;0.001) in liver from mice with HHcy. These findings suggest that methylation silencing of liver Fads2 expression and changes in liver fatty acids may contribute to the pathology of HHcy.

Although elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy) known as hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) are associated with increased inflammation and vascular remodeling, the mechanism of Hcy-mediated inflammation and vascular remodeling is unclear. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and adhesion molecules play an important role in vascular remodeling. We hypothesized that HHcy induces inflammation by increasing adhesion molecules and matrix protein expression. Endothelial cells were supplemented with high methionine, and Hcy accumulation was measured by HPLC. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability was detected by a NO probe. The protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis. MMP-9 activity was detected by gelatin-gel zymography. We demonstrated that methionine supplement promoted upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) through increased Hcy accumulation. In addition, increased synthesis of collagen type-1 was also observed. MMP-9 gene expression and protein activity were increased in methionine supplement groups. 3-Deazaadenosine (DZA), an adenosine analogue, prevented high methionine-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and collagen type-1 synthesis. Transfection of endothelial cells with cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) gene construct, which converts Hcy to cystathionine, reduced Hcy accumulation in high methionine-fed cells. CBS gene transfection reduced the inflammatory response, as evident by attenuated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Furthermore, collagen type-1 expression and MMP-9 activity were dramatically attenuated with CBS gene transfection. These results suggested that methionine supplement increased Hcy accumulation, which was associated with inflammatory response and matrix remodeling such as collagen type-1 synthesis and MMP-9 activity. However, in vitro DZA and CBS gene therapy successfully treated the HHcy-induced inflammatory reaction in the methionine metabolism pathway.

CBS is a vitamin B6-dependent transsulfuration enzyme needed to synthesize cysteine from methionine, catalyzing the condensation of serine with homocysteine to form cystathionine. A deficiency of CBS causes homocystinuria (MIM 236200), one of the most prevalent inborn errors, characterized by mental retardation, seizures, psychiatric disturbances, skeletal abnormalities and vascular disorders. Patients with CBS deficiency exhibit a major biochemical abnormality, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), a condition associated with highly elevated plasma homocysteine levels. HHcy is recognized as a risk factor for several neurological diseases, such as cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Although the link between CBS deficiency and homocystinuria was first described over 40 years ago and mental retardation was the first clinical feature of the disease to be classified, very little is known about the role of CBS in the CNS. Here we show the regional and cellular distribution of CBS in the adult and developing mouse brain. In the adult mouse brain, CBS was expressed ubiquitously, but most intensely in the cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CBS is preferentially expressed in cerebellar Bergmann glia and in astrocytes throughout the brain. At early developmental stages, CBS was expressed in neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone, but its expression changed to radial glial cells and then to astrocytes during the late embryonic and neonatal periods. Moreover, CBS was significantly accumulated in reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus after kainic acid-induced seizures, and cerebellar morphological abnormalities were observed in CBS-deficient mice. These results support the role of CBS in the development and maintenance of the CNS, and suggest that radial glia/astrocyte dysfunction might be involved in the complex neuropathological features associated with abnormal homocysteine metabolism.

Hydrogen sulfide is an endogenous mediator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle, exhibits several antiinflammatory activities, and contributes to gastric mucosal defense. This study was performed to examine the role of hydrogen sulfide in the resolution of injury; specifically, the healing of gastric ulcers. Ulcers were induced in rats by serosal application of acetic acid. This elicited a marked increase in gastric expression of the two key enzymes in hydrogen sulfide synthesis (cystathionine-beta-synthase and cystathionine-gamma-lyase) and in hydrogen sulfide synthesis. Twice-daily treatment for a week with hydrogen sulfide donors significantly increased the extent of healing of gastric ulcers as compared to vehicle-treatment. Similar treatment with L-cysteine, a precursor for hydrogen sulfide, also accelerated healing of the ulcers, and the effect was abolished by cotreatment with an inhibitor of cystathionine-gamma-lyase. The beneficial effects of hydrogen sulfide on ulcer healing were not dependent on nitric oxide synthesis, nor did they appear to occur through activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. These results suggest that hydrogen sulfide is produced in the gastric mucosa in response to injury and acts to promote healing. The results further suggest that drugs releasing hydrogen sulfide could be employed to accelerate healing of gastric ulcers, and possibly of other wounds.

BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia are two well-reported risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The effects of the synergistic combination of these two factors on vascular function need to be investigated.METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups of male mice were used: a control wild-type group; a group of mice heterozygous for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency; a group of mice heterozygous for apolipoprotein A-I deficiency; and, finally, a group of double heterozygous mice, with both cystathionine beta-synthase and apolipoprotein A-I deficiency. To characterize the resulting phenotype, several parameters including plasma apolipoproteins, lipid profiles, homocysteine, blood pressure and aortic protein were analyzed. As expected, our results indicate that double heterozygous mice are a model of mild hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hyperhomocysteinemia. Further, the additive combination of both risk factors resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure compared with control animals (136 +/- 8.0 versus 126 +/- 7.5 mm Hg, P &lt; 0.01) that was not present in single heterozygous mice. The increase in blood pressure was associated with decreased plasma nitric oxide levels, left ventricle hypertrophy and was independent of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, para-oxonase activity and kidney histological changes. Concomitant decreases in levels of apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA-IV) and caveolin-1 content were also found in the double heterozygous group.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest an additive adverse effect of hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hyperhomocysteinemia on endothelial function to generate clinical hypertension and cardiac muscle hypertrophy mediated by dysregulation in nitric oxide metabolism.

Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) synthesized from L-arginine by NO synthase and from heme by heme oxygenase, respectively, are the well-known neurotransmitters and are also involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Recent studies suggest that hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is the third gaseous mediator in mammals. H(2)S is synthesized from L-cysteine by either cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), both using pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (vitamin B(6)) as a cofactor. H(2)S stimulates ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)) in the vascular smooth muscle cells, neurons, cardiomyocytes and pancreatic beta-cells. In addition, H(2)S may react with reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species limiting their toxic effects but also, attenuating their physiological functions, like nitric oxide does. In contrast to NO and CO, H(2)S does not stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase. H(2)S is involved in the regulation of vascular tone, myocardial contractility, neurotransmission, and insulin secretion. H(2)S deficiency was observed in various animal models of arterial and pulmonary hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, gastric mucosal injury and liver cirrhosis. Exogenous H(2)S ameliorates myocardial dysfunction associated with the ischemia/reperfusion injury and reduces the damage of gastric mucosa induced by anti-inflammatory drugs. On the other hand, excessive production of H(2)S may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, septic shock, cerebral stroke and mental retardation in patients with Down syndrome, and reduction of its production may be of potential therapeutic value in these states.

Genetic disorders of homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism or a high-methionine diet lead to elevations of plasma Hcy levels. In humans, severe genetic hyperhomocysteinemia results in premature death from vascular complications whereas dietary hyperhomocysteinemia is often used to induce atherosclerosis in animal models. Hcy is mistakenly selected in place of methionine by methionyl-tRNA synthetase during protein biosynthesis, which results in the formation of Hcy-thiolactone and initiates a pathophysiological pathway that has been implicated in human vascular disease. However, whether genetic deficiencies in Hcy metabolism or a high-methionine diet affect Hcy-thiolactone levels in mammals has been unknown. Here we show that plasma Hcy-thiolactone is elevated 59-fold and 72-fold in human patients with hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cystathionine beta-synthase genes, respectively. We also show that mice, like humans, eliminate Hcy-thiolactone by urinary excretion; in contrast to humans, however, mice also eliminate significant amounts of plasma total Hcy (approximately 38%) by urinary excretion. In mice, hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to a high-methionine diet leads to 3.7-fold and 25-fold increases in plasma and urinary Hcy-thiolactone levels, respectively. Thus, we conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia leads to significant increases in the atherogenic metabolite Hcy-thiolactone in humans and mice.

Homocysteine is a thiol aminoacid synthesized during the metabolism of methionine. Increased plasma levels of homocysteine can be the result of mutations in the enzymes responsible for homocysteine metabolism, particularly cystathionine-beta synthase (CBS) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Additionally, nutritional deficiencies in B vitamin cofactors required for homocysteine metabolism, including folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), and/or vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), can induce hyperhomocysteinemia. Over the last decade, following in vitro and in vivo observations of a homocysteine-associated vascular pathology, convincing epidemiological evidence has been gathered on the relation between moderate elevation of plasma homocysteine and vascular disease, including cerebral ischemia. However, causality has yet to be established. The association between homocysteine and ischemic stroke might be a spurious epidemiological finding because of confounding or it might reflect reverse causality. If this is the case, elevated levels of plasma homocysteine should be interpreted as an epiphenomenon secondary to the vascular disease itself. Thus, whether lowering homocysteine concentration prevents cerebral ischemia remains to be determined. The only method to answer the question of the causal relation between homocysteine and ischemic stroke is by intervention trials in which patients at high vascular risk, such as those who have had a recent cerebral ischemic event are randomly allocated to placebo or homocysteine-lowering multivitamin therapy, and followed prospectively. Some of these randomized controlled trials are currently ongoing. Their results should hopefully resolve the issue in the next future.

Homocystinuria is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). The major clinical symptoms of this disease are mental retardation, lens dislocation, vascular disease with life-threatening thromboembolisms, and skeletal deformities. The major treatments for CBS deficiency include pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine or dietary restriction of methionine. There is currently no effective long-term treatment to lower the elevated plasma levels of homocysteine. However, gene therapy could be an effective novel approach for the treatment of homocystinuria. A recombinant adeno- associated virus vector carrying human CBS cDNA (rAAV-hCBS) was constructed and administered to CBS-/- mice by intramuscular (IM) and intraperitoneal (IP) injections. Serum homocysteine concentrations significantly decreased in treated mice compared with age-matched controls two weeks after treatment. The treated CBS-/- mice had life spans 3-7 days longer compared with untreated CBS-/- mice. In CBS-/- mice treated with rAAV-hCBS via IP injection, the vector was detected in all organs examined including liver, spleen, and kidney, and CBS gene expression was observed by immunohistochemical staining in the liver. These results indicate the efficacy of gene delivery and demonstrate the possibility of gene therapy mediated by AAV gene transfer in this mouse model of homocystinuria.

BACKGROUND: Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with premature vascular disease. The mechanism behind the vascular injuries is, however, still unknown. Homocysteine may be catabolized in the trans-sulfuration pathway to cysteine. Cystathionine beta-synthase, which catalyses the first step in the trans-sulfuration pathway is redox-sensitive. We have therefore investigated total extracellular homocysteine turnover in the presence of oxidative stress in human cell lines.METHODS: The turnover of total extracellular homocysteine in HeLa and hepatoma cell cultures has been investigated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the removal of high amounts of exogenously added homocysteine was also studied.RESULTS: Total extracellular homocysteine concentration in hepatoma cell cultures decreased in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, whereas the extracellular homocysteine concentration in HeLa cell cultures was not influenced. There was no significant change of intracellular homocysteine in any type of cell cultures. Furthermore, the presence of hydrogen peroxide did not increase the removal of exogenously added homocysteine.CONCLUSION: The presence of hydrogen peroxide probably increases the activity of the trans-sulfuration pathway in hepatoma cell cultures, which increases the intracellular use of homocysteine and lowers its extracellular release. Consequently this mechanism might tend to lower total plasma homocysteine concentration in oxidative stress.

The amino acid homocysteine (Hcy), formed from methionine has profound importance in health and diseases. In normal circumstances, it is converted to cysteine and partly remethylated to methionine with the help of vit B12 and folate. However, when normal metabolism is disturbed, due to deficiency of cystathionine-beta-synthase, which requires vit B6 for activation, Hcy is accumulated in the blood with an increase of methionine, resulting into mental retardation (homocystinuria type I). A decrease of cysteine may cause eye diseases, due to decrease in the synthesis of glutathione (antioxidant). In homocystinurias type II, III and IV, there is accumulation of Hcy, but a decrease of methionine, thus, there is no mental retardation. Homocysteinemia is found in Marfan syndrome, some cases of type I diabetes and is also linked to smoking and has genetic basis too. In hyperhomocysteinemias (HHcys), clinical manifestations are mental retardation and seizures (type I only), ectopia lentis, secondary glaucoma, optic atrophy, retinal detachment, skeletal abnormalities, osteoporosis, vascular changes, neurological dysfunction and psychiatric symptoms. Thrombotic and cardiovascular diseases may also be encountered. The harmful effects of homocysteinemias are due to (i) production of oxidants (reactive oxygen species) generated during oxidation of Hcy to homocystine and disulphides in the blood. These could oxidize membrane lipids and proteins. (ii) Hcy can react with proteins with their thiols and form disulphides (thiolation), (iii) it can also be converted to highly reactive thiolactone which could react with the proteins forming -NH-CO- adducts, thus affecting the body proteins and enzymes. Homocystinuria type I is very rare (1 in 12 lakhs only) and is treated with supplementation of vit B6 and cystine. Others are more common and are treated with folate, vit B12 and in selected cases as in methionine synthase deficiency, methionine, avoiding excess. In this review, the role of elevated Hcy levels in cardiovascular, ocular, neurologial and other diseases and the possible therapeutic measures, in addition to the molecular mechanisms involved in deleterious manifestations of homocysteinemia, have been discussed.

The exact mechanism(s) by which hyperhomocysteinaemia promotes vascular disease remains unclear. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the beneficial effect of folic acid on endothelial function is independent of homocysteine-lowering. In the present study the effect of a low (400 microg/70 kg/day) and high (5 mg/70 kg/day) dose folic acid supplement on endothelium-dependent relaxation in the isolated perfused mesenteric bed of heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficient mice was investigated. Elevated total plasma homocysteine and impaired relaxation responses to methacholine were observed in heterozygous mice. In the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester relaxation responses in wild-type tissues were reduced, but in heterozygous tissues were abolished. Clotrimazole and 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, both inhibitors of non-nitric oxide/non-prostanoid-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, reduced responses to methacholine in wild-type but not heterozygous tissues. The combination of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and either clotrimazole or 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibited relaxation responses in wild-type tissues. Both low and high dose folic acid increased plasma folate, reduced total plasma homocysteine and reversed endothelial dysfunction in heterozygous mice. A greater increase in plasma folate in the high dose group was accompanied by a more significant effect on endothelial function. In the presence of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a significant residual relaxation response was evident in tissues from low and high dose folic acid treated heterozygous mice. These data suggest that the impaired mesenteric relaxation in heterozygous mice is largely due to loss of the non-nitric oxide/non-prostanoid component. While low dose folic acid may restore this response in a homocysteine-dependent manner, the higher dose has an additional effect on nitric oxide-mediated relaxation that would appear to be independent of homocysteine lowering.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a recently identified gasotransmitter that may mediate hypoxic responses in vascular smooth muscle. H2S also appears to be a signaling molecule in mammalian non-vascular smooth muscle, but its existence and function in non-mammalian non-vascular smooth muscle have not been examined. In the present study we examined H2S production and its physiological effects in urinary bladder from steelhead and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and evaluated the relationship between H2S and hypoxia. H2S was produced by trout bladders, and its production was sensitive to inhibitors of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase. H2S produced a dose-dependent relaxation in unstimulated and carbachol pre-contracted bladders and inhibited spontaneous contractions. Bladders pre-contracted with 80 mmol l(-1) KCl were less sensitive to H2S than bladders contracted with either 80 mmol l(-1) KC2H3O2 (KAc) or carbachol, suggesting that some of the H2S effects are mediated through an ion channel. However, H2S relaxation of bladders was not affected by the potassium channel inhibitors, apamin, charybdotoxin, 4-aminopyridine, and glybenclamide, or by chloride channel/exchange inhibitors 4,4'-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid disodium salt, tamoxifen and glybenclamide, or by the presence or absence of extracellular HCO3-. Inhibitors of neuronal mechanisms, tetrodotoxin, strychnine and N-vanillylnonanamide were likewise ineffective. Hypoxia (aeration with N2) also relaxed bladders, was competitive with H2S for relaxation, and it was equally sensitive to KCl, and unaffected by neuronal blockade or the presence of extracellular HCO3-. Inhibitors of H2S synthesis also inhibited hypoxic relaxation. These experiments suggest that H2S is a phylogenetically ancient gasotransmitter in non-mammalian non-vascular smooth muscle and that it serves as an oxygen sensor/transducer, mediating the effects of hypoxia.

Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are a risk factor for systemic vascular diseases, stroke and vascular dementia. In recent years, increasing Hcy levels have been detected in neurological disorders that are not vascular in origin including Alzheimer's Disease and movement disorders (MD) such as idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD) and primary dystonia. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in PD results from L-Dopa administration and its O-methylation dependent from catechol-O-methyltransferase and may be implicated in the development of motor complications and non-motor symptoms, such as dementia. In a recent study, HHcy has been evidenced in HD patients, compared to controls. Because mutated Huntington protein influences Hcy metabolism by modulating cystathionine-beta-synthase activity, Hcy could represent a biological marker of neurodegeneration and could explain the leading role of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases as causes of death in HD. Finally, several cases of homocystinuria associated with dystonia, and some recent reports of elevated Hcy in patients with primary adult onset dystonia have been published. Increased Hcy plasma levels may have important implications in patients affected by these basal ganglia disturbances, by exerting neurotoxic effects, contributing to neurotransmitter imbalance in motor circuits, and increasing the risk for vascular insults and cognitive dysfunctions.

Chronic hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an important factor in development of arterial hypertension. HHcy is associated with activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); however, it is unclear whether HHcy-dependent extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation plays a role in arterial hypertrophy and hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that in HHcy the mechanism of arterial hypertension involves arterial dysfunction in response to ECM accumulation between endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells and subsequent endothelium-myocyte (E-M) uncoupling. To decrease plasma Hcy, dietary supplementation with 3-deazaadenosine (DZA), the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, was administered to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) knockout (KO) mice. Mice were grouped as follows: wild type (WT; control), WT+DZA, CBSKO, and CBSKO+DZA (n = 4/group). Mean aortic blood pressure and heart rate were monitored in real time with a telemetric system before, during, and after DZA treatment (6 wk total). In vivo aorta function and morphology were analyzed by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography in anesthetized mice. Aorta MMP activity in unfixed cryostat sections was measured with DQ gelatin. Aorta MMP-2, MMP-9, and connexin 43 expression were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. HHcy caused increased aortic blood pressure and resistance, tachycardia, and increased wall thickness and ECM accumulation in aortic wall vs. control groups. There was a linear correlation between aortic wall thickness and plasma Hcy levels. MMP-2, MMP-9, and connexin 43 expression were increased in HHcy. In the CBSKO+DZA group, aortic blood pressure and levels of MMP and connexin 43 were close to those found in control groups. However, removal of DZA reversed the aortic lumen-to-wall thickness ratio in CBSKO mice, suggesting, in part, a role of vascular remodeling in the increase in blood pressure in HHcy. The results show that arterial hypertension in HHcy mice is, in part, associated with arterial remodeling and E-M uncoupling in response to MMP activation.

Patients with Down syndrome appear to be protected from the development of atherosclerosis. On the contrary, hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. As hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency is associated with a decreased expression of paraoxonase-1, a major anti-atherosclerotic component secreted by the liver, we aimed to analyze the expression of paraoxonase-1 and cystathionine beta synthase in Down syndrome fetal liver by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Paraoxonase-1 was up-regulated in Down syndrome fetal liver, while cystathionine beta synthase gene expression in Down syndrome fetuses was similar to the gene level in control fetuses. Moreover, there was no evidence for an association between paraoxonase-1 genotypes influencing paraoxonase-1 gene expression and Down syndrome. Since most serum paraoxonase-1 is synthesized in the liver, an increase of hepatic paraoxonase-1 expression might be one of the factors which could explain the low incidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease in Down syndrome.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for thrombosis, but the mechanisms are not well defined. We tested the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia accelerates arterial thrombosis in mice. Mice heterozygous for a targeted disruption of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (Cbs+/-) and wild-type littermates (Cbs+/+) were fed either a control diet or a high methionine/low folate (HM/LF) diet for 6 to 8 months to produce graded hyperhomocysteinemia. The time to occlusion of the carotid artery after photochemical injury was shortened by more than 50% in Cbs+/+ or Cbs+/- mice fed the HM/LF diet (P &lt; .001 versus control diet). Carotid artery thrombosis was not accelerated in mice deficient in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Nos3), which suggests that decreased endothelium-derived nitric oxide is not a sufficient mechanism for enhancement of thrombosis. Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/- mice fed the HM/LF diet had elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in the carotid artery, increased aortic expression of the NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit, Nox4, and decreased activation of anticoagulant protein C in the aorta (P &lt; .05 versus control diet). We conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia enhances susceptibility to arterial thrombosis through a mechanism that is not caused by loss of endothelium-derived nitric oxide but may involve oxidative stress and impairment of the protein C anticoagulant pathway.

Elevated total plasma homocysteine concentrations (tHcy), both fasting and post-methionine load, have been established as risk factors for vascular disease. Recently, we described the association of a 31 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene with both CBS enzyme activity and tHcy concentrations. In the present study, we determined the 31 bp VNTR genotypes in 2598 individuals of the Framingham Offspring Study and studied the association between this genotype and fasting, 2-h post-methionine load and delta (ie increase upon methionine loading) tHcy concentrations in 1416 subjects. We observed a positive association between the number of repeat units of the CBS 31 bp VNTR and both postload and delta tHcy concentrations. Adjustment for possible effect modifying factors like age, sex and vitamin (B6, B12 and folate) status did not change this observation. We hereby confirm the results of our earlier study, in which we found that this 31 bp VNTR is a genetic determinant of post-methionine load tHcy concentrations. Since also post-methionine load tHcy concentrations are found to be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), this 31 bp VNTR may be considered a risk factor for CVD.

BACKGROUND: Rodents are often used as animal models to dissect mechanisms underlying hyperhomocysteinemia atherogenicity in humans. However, neither wild-type rodents nor cystathionine beta-synthase deficient mice develop spontaneous atherosclerosis. We investigated whether species-specific differences in thiols metabolism may explain the respective sensitivity of rodents and humans to hyperhomocysteinemia.METHODS: Thiols and vitamins B levels were determined in normohomocysteinemic humans and rodents, and in hyperhomocysteinemic mice.RESULTS: In basal status, although plasma homocysteine, cysteine and cysteinylglycine levels were lower, glutathione levels were higher in mice than in humans (4.0+/-1.6 vs. 7.9+/-2.2, P&lt;0.0005; 147.4+/-40.3 vs. 278.5+/-50.0, P&lt;0.0001; 2.3+/-0.7 vs. 36.6+/-7.3, P&lt;0.0001; and 70.9+/-20.1 vs. 4.6+/-1.6, P&lt;0.0001). Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels were 2.5- and 7.7-fold higher in rats than in humans. In wild-type mice, the increase in plasma Hcy levels induced by methionine-enriched diet was accompanied by a proportional increase in GSH levels.CONCLUSION: GSH levels are enough to modulate Hcy effects in normo- and hyperhomocysteinemic mice but not in humans. This rodents characteristic, likely supported by species differences in the relative contribution of remethylation and transsulfuration pathways, may partly explain their protection against atherosclerosis.

OBJECTIVE: Vascular disease is associated with increased plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and homocysteine, and both are increased in renal failure. In cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (CBS) there is severe hyperhomocysteinaemia, precocious vascular disease, and endothelial dysfunction. We investigated whether ADMA levels are elevated in CBS patients with and without renal impairment, and whether lowering plasma homocysteine also lowers ADMA.METHODS: We measured plasma homocysteine, arginine, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines, nitrate + nitrite, creatinine and cystatin C in 23 CBS-deficient patients and 24 age-matched controls.RESULTS: In the patients, nitrate + nitrite and the ratio L: -arginine/ADMA were markedly reduced (21.6 +/- 6.1 vs 57.7 +/- 7.5 micromol/L and 132.9 +/- 24.7 vs 181.9 +/- 56.1, respectively, p &lt; 0.001 for both), reflecting endothelial dysfunction. Plasma ADMA for the group was moderately increased (0.55 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.07 micromol/L, p = 0.018), but this was due to significantly higher levels than controls in only those 7 of the 23 patients who had elevated cystatin C levels (0.59 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.07 mg/L, p = 0.007). Posttreatment total homocysteine in patients varied widely (15-285, median 92 micromol/L), but was not correlated with ADMA or other measured variables. In three newly-diagnosed patients, marked reduction of total homocysteine during treatment produced minimal changes in ADMA.CONCLUSIONS: ADMA levels were significantly increased only in the CBS-deficient patients with elevated cystatin C levels, and not in those with normal renal function. The reported relationship between hyperhomocysteinaemia and ADMA may not be direct, but could be secondary to reduced renal function.

Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive disease most commonly caused by mutations in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). In this study we present the mutation analysis of 36 Colombian individuals from 10 unrelated kindred, with 11 individuals clinically classified as homocystinuric. Mutation analysis of the CBS gene revealed p.T191M, a prevalent mutation in Spain and Portugal, in the homozygous state in seven of the unrelated patients. Genotype-phenotype assessment of the p.T191M homozygous patients showed a high level of variability, including different severity in one pair of affected siblings. None of the patients responded biochemically to treatment with pharmacological doses of pyridoxine and folic acid as revealed by essentially unchanged homocysteine levels. This study offered a unique opportunity to study 18 heterozygous (p.T191M/wt) relatives of the homocystinuric patients. One atypical finding was that many of them presented with above average total homocysteine levels, putting them at an increased risk for vascular disease. Cryptorchidism was present in three of the cases, one of which presented also with Klinefelter syndrome. In addition to the previously described p.T191M mutation, a new mutation, p.A288T, was identified in a single individual. In this paper we present the first characterization, at a molecular level, of patients with homocystinuria from Colombia.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is caused by nutritional or genetic disturbances in homocysteine metabolism. A polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the most common genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia. To examine mechanisms by which an elevation in plasma homocysteine leads to vascular disease, we first performed microarray analyses in livers of Mthfr-deficient mice and identified differentially expressed genes that are involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Microarrays and RT-PCR showed decreased mRNA for apolipoprotein A (ApoA)-IV and for ApoA-I and increased mRNA for cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase (Cyp7A1) in Mthfr(+/-) mice compared with Mthfr(+/+) mice. Western blotting revealed that ApoA-I protein levels in liver and plasma of Mthfr(+/-) mice were 52% and 62% of levels in the respective tissues of Mthfr(+/+) mice. We also performed Western analysis for plasma ApoA-I protein levels in 60 males with coronary artery disease and identified a significant (P&lt;0.01) negative correlation (-0.33) between ApoA-I and plasma homocysteine levels. This cohort also displayed a negative correlation (-0.24, P=0.06) between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma homocysteine. Treatment of HepG2 cells with supraphysiological levels of 5 mmol/L homocysteine reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and ApoA-I protein levels and decreased ApoA-I promoter activity. Transfection with a PPARalpha construct upregulated ApoA-I and MTHFR. Our results suggest that hyperhomocysteinemia may increase risk of atherosclerosis by decreasing expression of ApoA-I and increasing expression of CYP7A1.

OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with risk for cardiovascular disease. A common cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is folate deficiency. We sought to determine whether folate deficiency per se increases arterial permeability (quantitative fluorescence microscopy) and stiffness (vessel elastigraph), and whether the effects of folate deficiency are more severe in the presence of mild HHcy.METHODS AND RESULTS: Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)-deficient mice (CBS(+/-)) and their wild-type littermates (CBS(+/+)) were fed chow containing either standard (Con) or relatively low amounts of folate (LF) for 18+/-3 weeks. Liver folate (microg folate/g liver) and tHcy (microM), respectively, were 12+/-1 and 8+/-1 in CBS(+/+) Con mice (n=12), and 8+/-1 and 8+/-1 in CBS(+/+) LF animals (n=5). Carotid arterial permeability was &amp;38% greater (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/+) LF versus Con mice, but vascular stiffening was unaltered. Liver folate and tHcy, respectively, were 13+/-1 and 11+/-1 in CBS(+/-) Con mice (n=16), and 8+/-1 and 16+/-3 in CBS(+/-) LF animals (n=6). Carotid arterial dextran accumulation was &amp;31% greater, and maximal strain in aortae was &amp;20% lower (both P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) LF versus Con mice.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, low folate (P&lt;0.05) combined with mild HHcy (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) mice produced more arterial dysfunction compared with low folate alone (ie, CBS(+/+) mice). These findings may be particularly relevant to elderly individuals because tHcy and deficiencies of folate metabolism increase with age.

INTRODUCTION: To the request of total plasma homocysteine determination in the investigation of vascular disease, diagnosis of homocystinuria in young adult patients with mild phenotype is not so rare.EXEGESIS: A 26-year-old man developed embolic cerebral infarction and a 22-year-old woman presented a right renal venous thrombosis one week after delivery. In each case, high concentration of total plasma homocysteine was first found and plasma and urinary amino acids analysis later on directed the diagnosis towards homocystinuria. Finally, reduced skin fibroblast cystathionine beta-synthase activity confirmed the diagnosis of homocystinuria.CONCLUSION: Total plasma homocysteine determination must be determined for screening for hyperhomocysteinemia in young adults with venous thromboembolism without characteristic phenotypic features of homocystinuria.

Down's syndrome (DS) or trisomy 21 is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation, and adults with DS develop Alzheimer type of disease (AD). Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is encoded on chromosome 21 and deficiency in its activity causes homocystinuria, the most common inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism and characterized by mental retardation and vascular disease. Here, we show that the levels of CBS in DS brains are approximately three times greater than those in the normal individuals. CBS is localized to astrocytes and those surrounding senile plaques in the brains of DS patients with AD. The over-expression of CBS may cause the developmental abnormality in cognition in DS children and that may lead to AD in DS adults.

BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) predisposes to vascular disease and results from interactions between genetic and nutritional factors. MTHFR C(677)T increases tHcy in association with low folate. CBS 844ins68 lowers tHcy and negates the raising effect of MTHFR C(677)T in healthy subjects, but it is unclear if this is the case in subjects at high risk of vascular disease. This study examines the effect on plasma tHcy of interactions between these polymorphisms in an at-risk group.METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 376 subjects at increased risk of coronary artery disease. Plasma tHcy and vitamin B(6) were measured by HPLC and red cell folate and serum vitamin B(12) were measured by immuno-luminometric assay. MTHFR C(677)T and CBS 844ins68 status was established by standard PCR techniques.RESULTS: MTHFR TT predisposed to hyperhomocysteinaemia; this was increased in the presence of low folate (P&lt;0.05) and vitamin B(12) (P&lt;0.01). An inverse relationship was found between tHcy and folate (r=-0.42, P&lt;0.0001), vitamin B(12) (r=-0.26, P&lt;0.0005) and vitamin B(6) (r=-0.25, P&lt;0.01). There was no interaction between plasma tHcy, vitamins or MTHFR C(677)T and CBS 844ins68.DISCUSSION: In this population at high risk of coronary artery disease, plasma tHcy was determined by vitamin status. This was exacerbated by the MTHFR C(677)T mutation. CBS 844ins68 did not influence tHcy and did not negate the tHcy-raising effect of MTHFR C(677)T.

OBJECTIVE: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has been reported to inhibit endothelial cell (EC) growth. Notwithstanding, precisely how HHcy regulates EC growth in vivo remains unknown. In this study, we established a mouse model of endothelial injury and reendothelialization and examined the role and mechanism of HHcy in endothelial repair.METHODS AND RESULTS: A mouse model of carotid artery air-dry endothelium denudation and reendothelialization was established and used to evaluate post-injury endothelial repair in mice with the gene deletion of cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS). Moderate and severe HHcy were induced in CBS+/+ and CBS-/+ mice through a high-methionine diet. Post-injury reendothelialization, which correlated with increased post-injury neointima formation, was impaired in severe HHcy mice. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we examined circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in HHcy mice and studied the effect of homocysteine (Hcy) on proliferation, migration, and adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The peripheral EPC population was not significantly altered in HHcy mice. Hcy had a profound inhibitory effect on EC proliferation and migration at physiologically relevant concentrations and inhibited EC adhesion at concentrations of 200 microM and higher.CONCLUSION: We have established a convenient and accurate mouse model of carotid injury in which the reendothelialization process can be precisely quantified. In addition, we have observed impaired reendothelialization and increased neointimal formation in severe HHcy mice. The capacity of Hcy to inhibit proliferation and migration of EC may be responsible for impaired reendothelialization and contribute to arteriosclerosis in HHcy.

OBJECTIVE: A risk factor for cardiovascular disease, hyperhomocystinemia (HHcy), is associated with endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we examined the mechanistic role of HHcy in endothelial dysfunction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Through the use of 2 functional models, aortic rings and intravital video microscopy of the cremaster, we found that arterial relaxation in response to the endothelium-dependent vessel relaxant, acetylcholine or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activator (A23187), was significantly impaired in cystathionine beta-synthase null (CBS(-/-)) mice. However, the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) response to the nitric oxide (NO) donor (SNAP) was preserved in CBS(-/-) mice. In addition, superoxide dismutase and catalase failed to restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was significantly reduced in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) of CBS(-/-) mice, as well as in Hcy-treated mouse and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Hcy-mediated eNOS inhibition--which was not rescued by adenoviral transduction of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, or by tetrahydrobiopterin, sepiapterin, and arginine supplementations in MAEC--was associated with decreased protein expression and increased threonine 495 phosphorylation of eNOS in HAECs. Ultimately, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X (GFX), reversed Hcy-mediated eNOS inactivation and threonine 495 phosphorylation in HAECs.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HHcy impairs endothelial function and eNOS activity, primarily through PKC activation.

Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism that is most often caused by mutation in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. Patients may develop serious clinical manifestations such as lens dislocation, mental retardation, osteoporosis, and atherothrombotic vascular disease. Over 100 mutations have been reported, but so far, none have been reported in Korea. Mutation analysis of the CBS gene in six Korean patients with homocystinuria was performed by direct sequencing. Eight mutations were identified, including four known mutations (T257M, R336C, T353M, and G347S) and four novel mutations (L154Q, A155V, del234D, and A288T). All patients were compound heterozygotes. To characterize these mutations, normal or mutated forms of CBS were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector followed by transfection into mammalian cells for transient expression. Whereas the expression levels of mutant proteins were comparable to that of normal control, enzyme activities of all the mutant forms were significantly decreased. In addition, a novel single nucleotide polymorphism, R18C, was identified, which showed one-third to two-thirds the enzyme activity of wild type and 1% of the allele frequency in normal control. The spectrum of mutations observed in Korean patients bears less resemblance to those observed in Western countries.

Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) correlate with increased risk of cardiovascular and Alzheimer diseases. We studied the effect of elevated Hcy on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to explore the possibility of a vascular link between the 2 diseases. On a hyperhomocysteinemic diet, cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs)-heterozygous mice develop hyperhomocysteinemia. Intravital microscopy analysis of the mesenteric venules showed that leukocyte rolling velocity was markedly decreased and numbers of adherent cells were increased in the mutant mice. This was due at least in part to increased expression of P-selectin. BBB permeability was measured by Evans blue dye permeation and was found to be 25% greater in the Cbs(+/-) cortex compared with wild-type controls. Our study suggests an important toxic effect of elevated Hcy on brain microvessels and implicates Hcy in the disruption of the BBB.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22) is a key enzyme in the generation of cysteine from methionine. A deficiency of CBS leads to homocystinuria, an inherited human disease characterized by mental retardation, seizures, psychiatric disturbances, skeletal abnormalities, and vascular disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show the regional and cellular distribution of CBS in the adult and developing mouse brain. In the adult mouse brain, CBS was expressed ubiquitously, but it is expressed most intensely in the cerebellar molecular layer and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CBS is preferentially expressed in cerebellar Bergmann glia and in astrocytes throughout the brain. At early developmental stages, CBS was expressed in neuroepithelial cells in the ventricular zone, but its expression changed to radial glial cells and then to astrocytes during the late embryonic and neonatal periods. CBS was most highly expressed in juvenile brain, and a striking induction was observed in cultured astrocytes in response to EGF, TGF-alpha, cAMP, and dexamethasone. Moreover, CBS was significantly accumulated in reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus after kainic acid-induced seizures, and cerebellar morphological abnormalities were observed in CBS-deficient mice. Taken together, these results suggest that CBS plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the CNS and that radial glia/astrocyte dysfunction might be involved in the complex neuropathological features associated with abnormal homocysteine metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Homocysteine (Hcy) is formed as an intermediary in methionine metabolism. Impairment of Hcy remethylation or transulfuration leads to hyperhomocysteinemia, which is considered as a risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease and stroke in chronic alcoholics. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in chronic alcoholics and the influence of alcohol consumption, vitamin deficiencies and liver damage on the plasma levels of Hcy.METHODS: 228 chronic alcoholic patients consecutively admitted for detoxication, classified according to clinical and biochemical data in normal liver (n = 117), and in mild to moderate liver disease (n = 111), and 49 healthy controls were studied. Blood levels of Hcy, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and folate were measured.RESULTS: Plasma Hcy was significantly higher in chronic alcoholics than in controls (9.66 +/- 8.1 vs. 6.93 +/- 2.33 mumol/liter, p &lt; 0.025). Furthermore, plasma Hcy levels were significantly higher in chronic alcoholics with liver injury (12.17 +/- 10.14 mumol/liter) than in those with normal liver and in controls (p &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia was also significantly higher in alcoholics with liver damage than in those with normal liver and in controls (29.7%, 5.1%, and 2%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Serum folate values were lower in chronic alcoholics than in controls (4.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 7.6 +/- 2.4 nmol/liter, p &lt; 0.001). The lowest values of folate were found in alcoholics with liver disease, especially in those with hyperhomocysteinemia, with a negative correlation between the two parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is common in chronic alcoholics, mainly in those with liver damage, suggesting that, although folate deficiencies may have a contributory role, liver impairment, through changes in methionine metabolism, is the most important mechanism for the elevated plasma Hcy found in these patients.

Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (HH) is an established independent risk factor for coronary, cerebral and peripheral vascular diseases. Recent studies have indicated that certain cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, impair expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endogenous angiogenesis. In this study, we investigate the impact of moderate HH on angiogenesis and VEGF pathway in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. Upon induction of unilateral hindlimb ischemia, endogenous angiogenesis, expression of VEGF, and phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1 were evaluated in mice heterozygous for a deletion of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (CBS) and compared with those observed in CBS+/+ mice. CBS+/- mice exhibit moderate HH, as demonstrated by measuring plasma total homocyst(e)ine (tHcy) levels, which were significantly higher in these animals compared with CBS+/+ mice (4.77 +/- 0.82 vs 2.10 +/- 0.28, p &lt; 0.01). Twenty-eight days after induction of ischemia, hindlimb blood flow was significantly reduced in CBS+/- mice compared with CBS+/+ animals (0.49 +/- 0.03, n = 12 vs 0.71 +/- 0.09, n = 10; p &lt; 0.05). In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between plasma homocyst(e)ine levels and the laser Doppler perfusion ratio in CBS+/- mice (p = 0.0087, r = -0.7171). While VEGF expression and Flk-1 phosphorylation were not impaired in the ischemic muscles of CBS+/- mice, phosphorylation of the endothelial cell survival factor Akt was significantly inhibited by homocyst(e)ine in a dose-dependent manner in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) in vitro. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that endogenous angiogenesis is inversely related to plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine in genetically engineered, heterozygous mice with moderate HH. This impairment, however, is not dependent on reduced expression of VEGF or impaired phosphorylation of its receptor Flk-1. In contrast, our data suggest that impaired Akt phosphorylation mediates the impairment of angiogenesis associated with HH.

Expression of the imprinted genes H19 and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), which lie in close proximity on mouse chromosome 7, is regulated by methylation of a differentially methylated domain (DMD) located 5' to H19. Biallelic expression of H19 has been observed in renal disease patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, a cardiovascular disease risk factor. The present study determined whether hyperhomocysteinemia produces decreased tissue methylation capacity, hypomethylation of the H19 DMD, and altered expression of H19 and Igf2 in adult mice. Mice heterozygous for disruption of the gene for cystathionine-beta-synthase (Cbs+/-) and C57BL/6 (Cbs+/+) mice were fed a hyperhomocysteinemic or control diet, respectively, from weaning until 9-12 months of age. Higher plasma total homocysteine (p &lt; 0.001) was found in hyperhomocysteinemic mice than in control mice (95 +/- 12 versus 5.0 +/- 0.3 micromol/liter). Hyperhomocysteinemia was accompanied by higher levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (p &lt; 0.05) and lower S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios (p &lt; 0.001) in liver and brain. The effect of hyperhomocysteinemia on H19 DMD methylation was tissue-specific. In liver, hyperhomocysteinemic mice had decreased H19 DMD methylation (p &lt; 0.001). In brain, hyperhomocysteinemia was accompanied by increased H19 DMD methylation (p &lt; 0.001) and a decrease in the ratio of H19/Igf2 transcripts (p &lt; 0.05). In aorta, hyperhomocysteinemia produced an increase in H19 DMD methylation (p &lt; 0.001) and a 2.5-fold increase in expression of H19 transcripts (p &lt; 0.05). Levels of H19 transcripts in aorta correlated positively with plasma total homocysteine concentration (p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.620). We conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia produces tissue-specific changes in H19 DMD methylation and increased vascular expression of H19 in adult mice.

Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with vascular dementias and Alzheimer's disease. The role of Hcy in brain microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) remodeling is unclear. Hcy competes with muscimol, an gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor agonist. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Our hypothesis is that Hcy induces constrictive microvascular remodeling by altering GABA-A/B receptors. MVEC from wild type, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) knockout (-/-), heterozygote cystathionine beta synthase (CBS-/+), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS-/-) mouse brains were isolated. The MVEC were incorporated into collagen (3.2 mg/ml) gels and the decrease in collagen gel diameter at 24 h was used as an index of constrictive MVEC remodeling. Gels in the absence or presence of Hcy were incubated with muscimol or baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist. The results suggested that Hcy-mediated MVEC collagen gel constriction was ameliorated by muscimol, baclofen, MMP-9, and eNOS gene ablations. There was no effect of anti-alpha 3 integrin. However, Hcy-mediated brain MVEC collagen constriction was abrogated with anti-beta-1 integrin. The co-incubation of Hcy with L-arginine ameliorated the Hcy-mediated collagen gel constriction. The results of this study indicated amelioration of Hcy-induced MVEC collagen gel constriction by induction of nitric oxide through GABA-A and -B receptors.

Homocysteine is a thiol-containing amino acid that has gained notoriety because its elevation in the plasma is correlated with complex and multifactorial diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and neural tube defects. Homocysteine is redox-active, and its toxic effects have been frequently attributed to direct or indirect perturbation of redox homeostasis. Although the literature on the pathophysiology of elevated homocysteine is rather extensive, a very wide range of concentrations of this amino acid has been used in these studies ranging from normal to pathophysiological to unphysiological. It is clear that homocysteine induces varied responses that are specific to cell type and that cells, depending on their origin, display a wide range of sensitivity to homocysteine. In this review, we focus on the redox signaling pathways that have been connected to homocysteine in vascular (endothelial and smooth muscle) cells and in neuronal cells. We also discuss redox regulation of the key enzymes involved in homocysteine clearance: methionine synthase, betaine-homocysteine methyltranferase, and cystathionine beta-synthase.

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a metabolite of the essential amino acid methionine. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with vascular disease, particularly carotid stenosis. Rosiglitazone, a ligand of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma , attenuates balloon catheter-induced carotid intimal hyperplasia in type 2 diabetic rats. We studied 4 groups (n = 7 per group) of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats fed (a) powdered laboratory chow (control), (b) control diet with rosiglitazone (3.0 mg/kg/d), (c) diet containing 1.0% l -methionine, and (d) diet containing methionine and rosiglitazone. After 1 week on high methionine diet, the rats were administered an aqueous preparation of rosiglitazone by oral gavage. One week after initiation of rosiglitazone, balloon catheter injury of the carotid artery was carried out using established methods, and the animals continued on their respective dietary and drug regimens for another 21 days. At the end of the experimental period, blood samples were collected, and carotid arteries and liver were harvested. Serum Hcy increased significantly on methionine diet compared with controls (28.9 +/- 3.2 vs 6.3 +/- 0.04 micromol/L). Development of intimal hyperplasia was 4-fold higher in methionine-fed rats; this augmentation was significantly reduced ( P &lt; .018) in rosiglitazone-treated animals. Rosiglitazone treatment significantly ( P &lt; .001) suppressed Hcy levels and increased the activity of the Hcy metabolizing enzyme, cystathionine-beta-synthase in the liver samples. Hcy (100 micromol/L) produced a 3-fold increase in proliferation of rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells; this augmentation was inhibited by incorporating rosiglitazone (10 micromol/L). After balloon catheter injury to the carotid artery of animals on a high methionine diet, there was an increase in the rate of development of intimal hyperplasia consistent with the known effects of Hcy. It is demonstrated for the first time that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone can attenuate the Hcy-stimulated increase in the rate of development of intimal hyperplasia indirectly by increasing the rate of catabolism of Hcy by cystathionine-beta-synthase and directly by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. These findings may have important implications for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and events in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy).

Arteriosclerosis and its complications, such as heart attack and stroke, are the major causes of death in developed countries. It was believed that age, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and smoking are common risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, overwhelming clinical and epidemiological studies have identified homocysteine (Hcy) as a significant and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In healthy individuals, plasma Hcy is between 5 and 10 micromol/L. One cause of severe hypehomocys- teinemia (HHcy) is the deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which converts Hcy to cystathionine. CBS homozygous deficiency results in severe HHcy with Hcy levels up to 100 to 500 micromol/L. Patients with severe HHcy usually present with neurological abnormalities, premature arteriosclerosis. It has been reported that lowering plasma Hcy improved endothelial dysfunction and reduced incidence of major adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention. The mechanisms by which Hcy induces atherosclerosis are largely unknown. Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain cardiovascular pathological changes associated with HHcy. These include: (1) endothelial cell damage and impaired endothelial function; (2) dysregulation of cholesterol and triglyceride biosynthesis; (3) stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation; (4) thrombosis activation and (5) activation of monocytes. Four major biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the vascular pathology of Hcy. These include: (1) autooxidation through the production of reactive oxygen species; (2) hypomethylation by forming SAH, a potent inhibitor of biological transmethylations; (3) nitrosylation by binding to nitric oxide or (4) protein homocysteinylation by incorporating into protein. In summary, our studies, as well as data from other laboratories support the concept that Hcy is causally linked to atherosclerosis, and is not merely associated with the disease. Although folic acid, vitamin B12 and B6 can lower plasma Hcy levels, the long-term effects on cardiovascular disease risk are still unknown and judgments about therapeutic benefits await the findings of ongoing clinical trials.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: High plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), low dietary intake of folate and other B vitamins, and genetic polymorphisms related to the metabolism of homocysteine may interactively contribute to the risk of cerebral vascular disease (CVD). We explored interrelations between total homocysteine levels and mutations in genes for the two key enzymes in methionine-homocysteine metabolism.PATIENTS AND METHOD: We analyzed two polymorphisms, C677T in the MTHFR gene and 844ins68 in the CBS gene. We assessed their association with fasting homocysteine in 64 patients with CVD, and in 159 controls.RESULTS: No differences in CBS and MTHFR genotype frequencies between cases and controls were found (C677T p = 0.87 and 844ins68 p = 0.63), nor was a particular CBS and MTHFR genotype associated with an elevated risk of CVD. None of the genotypes defined by the CBS and MTHFR variants studied showed an association with elevated fasting homocysteine concentrations (C677T p = 0.07 and 844ins68 p = 0.47).CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any indication that genetic variation in the CBS and MTHFR genes are associated with homocysteine-related risk of CVD, hence needing further investigation. The contributions to total plasma homocysteine levels of the common mutations of genes coding for the enzymes controlling homocysteine metabolism are modest.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated Saratin's (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) prevention of platelet adhesion and intimal hyperplasia at different doses and in the hyperhomocystinemia rat carotid endarterectomy (CEA) model.METHODS: Rats were divided into two groups: (1) platelet adhesion or (2) luminal stenosis because of intimal hyperplasia. At CEA, rats received 0, 0.5, 5.0, 10.0, or 20.0 microg Saratin on the artery. Post-CEA platelet aggregation was evaluated by standard error of the mean. Intimal hyperplasia group received either (1) control or (2) 4.5 g/kg DL-homocystine diets for two weeks followed by CEA and treated with diluent or 5.0 microg Saratin. Endpoints included platelet adhesion, intimal hyperplasia, plasma homocysteine (HCys), and its metabolic enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).RESULTS: Platelet adhesion: post-CEA, platelet adhesion was reduced by 63%, 67%, and 67% in Saratin doses &gt; or =5.0 microg. Intimal hyperplasia: 5.0 microg Saratin in the HCys group decreased intimal hyperplasia by 45% compared with the non-Saratin-treated HCys group. Plasma HCys levels were not altered with Saratin treatment in the HCys groups nor were CBS or MTHFR.CONCLUSIONS: Saratin significantly inhibited platelet adhesion at &gt; or =5.0 microg, and Saratin at 5.0 microg attenuated luminal stenosis in a hyperhomocysteinemic rat CEA model.

Homocystinuria is a congenital metabolic disorder, and has been known as life-threatening risk factor of vascular disease including ischemic stroke. We report a case of cerebral infarction due to homocystinuria. The patient was a 21-year-old woman exhibiting left hemiparesis and a previous history of ectopia lentis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple fresh infarctions in the right frontal and temporal lobes, basal ganglia, corona radiata, and internal capsule. The right common carotid angiogram demonstrated complete occlusion at the origin of the right internal carotid artery. Further investigation clarified increased level of serum methionine and homocysteine and urinary homocystin due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Homocystinuria was diagnosed as the cause of cerebral infarction. The patient was treated by low methionine diet and administration of folic acid, cobalamin, and aspirin. It should be recognized that some patients with homocystinuria are missed in the neonatal screening for congenital metabolic disorders. Recent studies indicated that the homocysteinemia is one of risk factors of ischemic stroke in the general population as well as in the patients of homocystinuria. We recommend metabolic screening for homocystinuria, when treating a juvenile patient with ischemic stroke of unknown etiology.

OBJECTIVE: The effect of a rat carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on homocysteine and the metabolic enzymes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) was studied.METHODS: Rats were placed into 7 groups: (1) no anesthesia (NA), (2) anesthesia only (AO), (3) skin opened and closed (O/C), (4) skin opened with exposure of the carotid artery and closed (O/E/C), (5) carotid isolated and clamped (CO), (6) open CEA, and (7) open femoral endarterectomy (FEA). End points included homocysteine, hepatic MTHFR, and CBS activity.RESULTS: Homocysteine in the NA, AO, O/C, O/E/C, and FEA were low and not different. CEA produced a 6-fold increase in homocysteine when compared with non-CEA groups. Specifically, CEA produced an increase in homocysteine versus the AO group at 2 weeks (11.3 +/- 0.7 vs 2.1 +/- 0.9 micromol/L;P &lt; .001), 4 weeks (8.9 +/- 0.7 vs 3.5 +/- 0.9 micromol/L; P = .004) and 6 weeks (7.7 +/- 0.9 vs 3.1 +/- 1.5 micromol/L; P = .03). The CO group had increased homocysteine versus the O/C, O/E/C, and FEA, but was lower than the CEA group. CEA produced an increase in MTHFR and CBS versus the AO group.CONCLUSIONS: CEA resulted in elevated levels of homocysteine; however, when broken down into its component parts, no elevation was observed except for a small increase with the CO procedure. Manipulation of the femoral artery did not raise homocysteine levels. The increase in homocysteine is possibly due to the combination of vessel wall damage and changes in cerebral blood flow dynamics.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is a consequence of impaired methionine/cysteine metabolism and is caused by deficiency of vitamins and/or enzymes such as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Although HHCY is an important and independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that are commonly associated with hepatic steatosis, the mechanism by which homocysteine promotes the development of fatty liver is poorly understood. CBS-deficient (CBS(-/-)) mice were previously generated by targeted deletion of the Cbs gene and exhibit pathological features similar to HHCY patients, including endothelial dysfunction and hepatic steatosis. Here we show abnormal lipid metabolism in CBS(-/-) mice. Triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid levels were markedly elevated in CBS(-/-) mouse liver and serum. The activity of thiolase, a key enzyme in beta-oxidation of fatty acids, was significantly impaired in CBS(-/-) mouse liver. Hepatic apolipoprotein B100 levels were decreased, whereas serum apolipoprotein B100 and very low density lipoprotein levels were elevated in CBS(-/-) mice. Serum levels of cholesterol/phospholipid in high density lipoprotein fractions but not of total cholesterol/phospholipid were decreased, and the activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was severely impaired in CBS(-/-) mice. Abnormal high density lipoprotein particles with higher mobility in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were observed in serum obtained from CBS(-/-) mice. Moreover, serum cholesterol/triglyceride distribution in lipoprotein fractions was altered in CBS(-/-) mice. These results suggest that hepatic steatosis in CBS(-/-) mice is caused by or associated with abnormal lipid metabolism.

The formation of H2S from cyst(e)ine is catalyzed by three enzymes, cystathionine beta synthase, cystathionase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In the liver, kidney, enterocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, H2S is principally synthesized by cystathionase. In contrast, it is synthesized by cystathionine beta synthase in the brain and partially by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in cardiac tissue. H2S is catabolized, essentially in mitochondria by thiosulfate reductase. The sulfite generated is then oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase. The amount of thiosulfate excreted in the urine is the best indicator of H2S biosynthesis, together with sulfhemoglobin determination in erythrocytes. H2S acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, increasing responses mediated by NMDA receptors, facilitating the induction of long-term potentialization in the hippocampus. H2S also acts as a vasodilator, acting directly on ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. The concentration of H2S is abnormally low in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease, due to changes in the concentration of the physiological activator of cystathionine beta synthase. The overproduction of H2S described in subjects with Down's syndrome probably results from the overproduction of cystathionine beta synthase, as the gene encoding this protein is located on chromosome 21.

BACKGROUND: Homocysteine and smoking are independent risks for CVD; however their importance in post-CEA intimal hyperplasia is unclear. We performed a CEA in rats exposed to cigarette smoke with the hypothesis that smoking would increase intimal hyperplasia that may be associated with an elevated serum homocysteine. Folic acid (FA) and the homocysteine metabolic enzymes MTHFR and CBS were used to test for the significance of homocysteine elevation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats underwent an open CEA. N = 13 rats received smoke exposure 2 weeks prior, and 2 weeks post-CEA and N = 12 received no smoke. Each group was divided into either control or an FA-added diet resulting in four groups. Rats were sacrificed at 2 weeks post-CEA; liver, urine, blood, and carotid arteries samples were obtained.RESULTS: Smoked rats had increased urinary peak and trough cotinine levels versus non-smoke rats, which decreased with FA. Smoke exposure increased intimal hyperplasia versus non-smoke controls by nearly 120% (57.8 +/- 6.2 versus 26.8 +/- 5.4% luminal stenosis, P = 0.005). Smoke-exposed rats had an increased serum homocysteine versus non-smoke controls (8.3 +/- 0.8 versus 5.7 +/- 0.8 microm, P = 0.014). Smoked rats given FA had decreased serum homocysteine compared to the smoke group. Along with reductions in homocysteine, FA eliminated the increase in intimal hyperplasia seen with smoke exposure (33.5 +/- 6.1 versus 57.8 +/- 6.2% luminal stenosis, P = 0.03). CBS activity decreased in smoked rats by nearly 20% versus non-smoke rats. FA supplementation in smoked rats both (1) increased CBS activity and (2) decreased MTHFR compared to control non-smoke-exposure levels.CONCLUSION: Smoking increases plasma homocysteine and post-CEA intimal hyperplasia. This suggests homocysteine has an etiological role in the intimal hyperplasia increase observed with smoking, since both were negated with FA.

Recent studies suggest that apart from nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is another inorganic gaseous mediator in the cardiovascular system. H2S is synthesized from L-cysteine by either cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or cystathionin gamma--lyase (CSE), both using pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. CBS is the main H2S-producing enzyme in the brain and CSE is involved in H2S formation in the cardiovascular system. H2S induces hypotension in vivo and vasodilation vitro by opening KATP channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. Chronic administration of CSE inhibitor induces arterial hypertension in the rat. In addition, decreased H2S generation has been demonstrated in the vasculature of spontaneously hypertensive rat, in experimental hypertension induced by NO synthase blockade, and in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, and administration of exogenous H2S donor has significant therapeutic effects in these models. Deficiency of H2S may contribute to atherogenesis in some patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, in whom the metabolism of homocysteine to cysteine and H2S is compromised by vitamin B6 deficiency. Reduced H2S production in the brain was observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, excess of H2S may lead to mental retardation in patients with Down's syndrome and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypotension associated with septic shock.

Increased homocysteine is associated with the pregnancy complication preeclampsia and with later-life cardiovascular disease. Although elevated homocysteine persists after pregnancy, the vascular changes of preeclampsia abate with delivery, and cardiovascular disease occurs decades later. This suggests the vasculature during pregnancy may manifest increased sensitivity to homocysteine. We used the cystathionine-beta synthase (CBS)-deficient transgenic mouse to investigate whether hyperhomocysteinemia would differentially affect vascular function in nonpregnant and pregnant animals. Mesenteric arteries from nonpregnant and midpregnant (14 to 16 days) wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous CBS-deficient transgenic mice were investigated for their response to vasoconstriction, endothelial-dependent, and endothelial-independent relaxation using an isometric wire myograph system. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was similar in arteries from nonpregnant heterozygous and wild-type mice. In contrast, endothelial-dependent relaxation was reduced significantly in arteries from pregnant heterozygous animals compared with wild-type mice. Inhibition of NO synthesis blunted relaxation in arteries from pregnant wild-type but not pregnant heterozygous mice. Endothelial-dependent relaxation was restored by in vitro pretreatment with the tetrahydrobiopterin precursor sepiapterin. These data indicate that in pregnant mice, endothelial-dependent vasodilation is more sensitive to the effect of increased homocysteine than arteries from nonpregnant mice. This effect appears to result from a loss in NO-mediated relaxation that may be mediated by the oxidative inactivation of the NO synthase cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Mutations in the enzymes responsible for homocysteine metabolism, particularly cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), result in severe forms of HHcy. Additionally, nutritional deficiencies in B vitamin cofactors required for homocysteine metabolism, including folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), and/or B12 (methylcobalamin), can induce HHcy. Studies using animal models of genetic- and diet-induced HHcy have recently demonstrated a causal relationship between HHcy, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Dietary enrichment in B vitamins attenuates these adverse effects of HHcy. Although oxidative stress and activation of proinflammatory factors have been proposed to explain the atherogenic effects of HHcy, recent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that HHcy induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This review summarizes the current role of HHcy in endothelial dysfunction and explores the cellular mechanisms, including ER stress, that contribute to atherothrombosis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperhomocysteinemia is an emerging risk factor for stroke, but little is known about effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on cerebral vascular function. We tested the hypothesis that chronic hyperhomocysteinemia in mice causes endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arterioles through a mechanism that involves superoxide.METHODS: Mice heterozygous for a targeted disruption of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (Cbs+/-) and their wild type littermates (Cbs+/+) were fed either a control diet or a high-methionine diet for 10 to 12 months.RESULTS: Plasma total homocysteine was elevated with the high-methionine diet compared with the control diet for both Cbs+/+ (7.9+/-1.0 versus 5.0+/-0.5 micromol/L; P&lt;0.05) and Cbs+/- (20.5+/-3.1 versus 8.2+/-0.9 micromol/L; P&lt;0.001) mice. Dilatation of cerebral arterioles ( approximately 30 microm baseline diameter) was measured in vivo in response to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine or the endothelium-independent dilator nitroprusside. Vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired with the high-methionine diet compared with the control diet for both Cbs+/+ and Cbs+/- mice (P&lt;0.01). Dilatation of arterioles to acetylcholine was restored toward normal by the superoxide scavenger tiron (P&lt;0.05). Vasodilatation to nitroprusside was not influenced by Cbs genotype or diet. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining for vascular superoxide was elevated in Cbs+/- mice fed the high-methionine diet and was inhibited by apocynin or Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, implicating NAD(P)H oxidase and nitric oxide synthase as potential sources of superoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Superoxide is a key mediator of endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral circulation during diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia.

Increased total plasma homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to determine whether it can impair endothelial function, by examining the recovery of acetylcholine-evoked relaxation following mechanical denudation of the endothelium in the arteries of cystathionine beta-synthase knockout (CbetaS(+/-)) mice. Heterozygous CbetaS(+/-) mice had total plasma homocysteine concentrations significantly higher (8.9 +/- 1.1 micromol/L, n = 12) than strain-matched wild-types (4.6 +/- 0.4 micromol/L, n = 5; P =.003). Left common carotid arteries were denuded of endothelium using a 250-microm polytetrafluoroethylene filament. After 10 days, when the endothelium had completely regrown, relaxation to acetylcholine was measured in precontracted segments of artery. Uninjured right carotid arteries from the same animals served as internal controls. Relaxation to acetylcholine was significantly attenuated in the injured arteries of the CbetaS(+/-) mice, compared to wild-types (P =.017); furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between sensitivity to acetylcholine and total plasma homocysteine concentration measured in the same animal (r = -0.69, P &lt;.003). These data suggest that even modest homocysteinemia has a deleterious effect on the function of healed endothelium in mouse arteries. This may account for its adverse influence on chronic cardiovascular disease.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an inherited disorder of homocysteine transsulfuration, which manifests by neurological, vascular and connective tissue involvement. So far, 130 pathogenic mutations have been recognized in the CBS gene. We examined 10 independent alleles in Polish patients suffering from CBS deficiency, and we detected four already described mutations (c.1224-2A&gt;C, c.684C&gt;A, c.833T&gt;C, and c.442G&gt;A) and two novel mutations (c.429C&gt;G and c.1039+1G&gt;T). The pathogenicity of the novel mutations was demonstrated by expression in E.coli. This is the first published communication on mutations leading to CBS deficiency in Poland.

Homocysteine has emerged as a novel independent marker of risk for the development of cardiovascular disease over the past three decades. Additionally, there is a graded mortality risk associated with an elevated fasting plasma total homocysteine (tHcy). Metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are now considered to be a strong coronary heart disease (CHD) risk enhancer and a CHD risk equivalent respectively. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in patients with MS and T2DM would be expected to share a similar prevalence to the general population of five to seven percent and of even greater importance is: Declining glomerular filtration and overt diabetic nephropathy is a major determinant of tHcy elevation in MS and T2DM. There are multiple metabolic toxicities resulting in an excess of reactive oxygen species associated with MS, T2DM, and the accelerated atherosclerosis (atheroscleropathy). HHcy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and its individual role and how it interacts with the other multiple toxicities are presented.The water-soluble B vitamins (especially folate and cobalamin-vitamin B12) have been shown to lower HHcy. The absence of the cystathionine beta synthase enzyme in human vascular cells contributes to the importance of a dual role of folic acid in lowering tHcy through remethylation, as well as, its action of being an electron and hydrogen donor to the essential cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. This folate shuttle facilitates the important recoupling of the uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme reaction and may restore the synthesis of the omnipotent endothelial nitric oxide to the vasculature.

Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) is required for transsulfuration of homocysteine, an amino acid implicated in vascular disease. We studied homocysteine metabolism in mice with mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to a heterozygous disruption of the Cbs gene. Mice were fed diets supplemented with betaine or dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA); betaine and DMSA provide methyl groups for an alternate pathway of homocysteine metabolism, remethylation by betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). On control diets, heterozygous mice had 50% higher plasma homocysteine than did wild-type mice. Betaine and DMSA had similar effects in both genotype groups: liver betaine increased dramatically, while plasma homocysteine decreased by 40% to 50%. With increasing betaine supplementation, homocysteine decreased by 75%. Plasma homocysteine and BHMT activity both showed a strong negative correlation with liver betaine. Homocysteinemia in mice is sensitive to a disruption of Cbs and to methyl donor intake. Because betaine leads to a greater flux through BHMT and lowers homocysteine, betaine supplementation may be beneficial in mild hyperhomocysteinemia.

Elevated total plasma homocysteine is an independent risk factor in the development of vascular disease in humans. Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is an enzyme that condenses homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine. In this article, we describe the effects of modulating CBS activity using a transgenic mouse that contains the human CBS cDNA under control of the zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter (Tg-CBS). In the presence of zinc, Tg-CBS mice have a 2- to 4-fold increase in liver and kidney CBS activity compared with nontransgenic littermates. Transgenic mice on standard mouse chow had a 45% decrease in their serum homocysteine (12.1 to 7.2 micromol/L; P&lt;0.0001) when zinc was added to drinking water, although zinc had minimal effect on their nontransgenic siblings (13.2 micromol/L versus 13.0 micromol/L; P=NS). Tg-CBS mice maintained on a high-methionine, low-folate diet also had significantly lower serum homocysteine compared with control animals (179 micromol/L versus 242 micromol/L; P&lt;0.02). CBS overexpression also significantly lowered serum cysteinylglycine (3.6 versus 2.8 micromol/L; P&lt;0.003) levels and reduced the levels of many amino acids in the liver. We also found that expression of Tg-CBS rescued the severe hyperhomocysteinemia and neonatal lethality of Cbs deletion animals. Our results show that elevating CBS activity is an effective method to lower plasma homocysteine levels. In addition, the creation of an inducible mouse system to modulate plasma homocysteine will also be useful in the study of homocysteine-related vascular disease.

Deficiency in cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) leads to high plasma homocysteine concentrations and causes hyperhomocysteinemia, a common risk factor for vascular disease, stroke and possibly neurodegenerative diseases. Various neuronal diseases have been associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, but the molecular mechanisms of homocysteine toxicity are unknown. We investigated the pathways involved in the pathological process, by analyzing differential gene expression in neuronal tissues. We used a combination of differential display and cDNA arrays to identify genes differentially expressed during hyperhomocysteinemia in brain of CBS-deficient mice. In this murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia, both plasma and brain homocysteine concentrations were high. Several genes were found to be differentially expressed in the brains of CBS-deficient mice, and the identities of some of these genes suggested that the SAPK/JNK pathway was altered in the brains of CBS-deficient mice. We therefore investigated the activation of proteins involved in the SAPK/JNK cascade. JNK and c-Jun were activated in the hippocampal neurones of CBS-deficient mice, suggesting that the SAPK/JNK pathway may play an important role in the development of neuronal defects associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.

BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported in type II diabetic patients with documented vascular disease; hence the hypothesis that hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to overall mortality in diabetic patients. The link between insulin and homocysteine metabolism has not been completely clarified yet; in particular, only few data are available on the effects of insulin in vivo on homocysteine metabolism in the presence of abnormalities of sulphur amino acid metabolism (methionine intolerance).MATERIALS AND METHODS: To establish whether methionine intolerance and which of its determinants could influence total plasma homocysteine in response to insulin infusion in vivo in type II diabetic patients, we submitted 18 patients (Group A) with normal and 18 patients with abnormal (hyperhomocysteinemia) (Group B) response to oral methionine load to a glucose/clamp study. At time 0, and 30, 60 and 120 minutes after hyperinsulinemia, homocysteine and methionine plasma levels were assessed. In order to evaluate the cause of methionine intolerance, all patients were assayed for fasting homocysteine-cysteine ratio (as a marker of suspected heterozygosis for cystathionine-beta-synthase deficit), MTHFR C (677)T status and homocysteine-related vitamin status (serum vitamin B (6) [PLP], vitamin B (12) and folate).RESULTS: After hyperinsulinemia, plasma methionine was reduced (by about - 30 % at 120 minutes vs. basal values) within both groups, whereas tHcy tend to decrease in group A following insulin administration (up to - 6.6 +/- 3.6 % vs. basal values at 120 minutes) with a significantly higher variability, while in patients with &quot;methionine intolerance&quot; (group B) tHcy tended to increase (up to + 29.05 +/- 8.3 % vs. basal values at 120 min from the clamp). Serum folic acid (7.45 +/- 2.8 vs. 4.82 +/- 2.5 nmol/L, p &lt; 0.05), Vit. B (12) (348 +/- 78 vs. 242 +/- 65 pmol/L, p &lt; 0.05) and PLP (84.1 +/- 23.6 vs. 50.6 +/- 32.4 nmol/L; p &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher in group A than in group B; PLP levels significantly correlated with homocysteine after 4 h methionine load (n = 36; r = - 0.327, p &lt; 0.05); group A showed also a significantly lower prevalence of suspected heterozygosis for cystathionine-beta-synthase deficit (1/18 [11.1 %] vs. 5/18 [33.3 %], p &lt; 0.05) and MTHFR T allele presence (4/18 [22.2 %] vs. 11/18 [61.1 %], p &lt; 0.01). A stepwise regression analysis with tHcy plasma level variations (event A = reduction; event B = increase) as the dependent variable showed that low serum folate and PLP levels and presence of MTHFR T allele were the variables associated with insulin-induced tHcy increase.CONCLUSIONS: Methionine intolerance may influence the effect of insulin administration on plasma homocysteine in patients affected by type 2 diabetes. To prevent a possible acute (and repeated) hyperhomocysteinemia due to insulin administration in cases of methionine intolerance, it may be useful to assess the presence of methionine intolerance (tHcy after oral methionine loading) and Hcy-related vitamin status in all patients due to be subjected to insulin therapy.

H2S is an important gasotransmitter with a vasorelaxant property. The modulation of endogenous H2S generation from different tissues and the functional consequence of this modulation are not clear. In the present study, the production of H2S from vascular tissues as well as the liver and ileum of rats was measured. The H2S production rate was significantly greater in rat liver than rat vascular tissues. H2S production in rat aortae, ileum, and liver tissues was upregulated by sodium nitroprusside in a cGMP-dependent fashion. Amino-oxyacetate (AOA) (1 mM) abolished H2S production in liver tissues and partially inhibited H2S production in the ileum, while D,L-propargylglycine (PPG) at a similar concentration only slightly inhibited H2S production in liver. Intraperitoneal injection PPG, but not AOA, significantly suppressed H2S production in liver, aorta, and ileum tissues. The systolic blood pressure of rats was significantly increased 2-3 weeks after i.p. injection of PPG. It is concluded that the endogenous production of H2S could be modulated by NO. AOA and PPG have different capacities in regulating the endogenous production of H2S in different types of tissues.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is the second most treatable aminoacidopathy. The reported incidence varies from 1 in 344,000 worldwide to 1 in 65,000 in Ireland. Untreated patients with homocystinuria have severe hyperhomocysteinaemia. Amongst its pathological sequelae, which include mental retardation, ectopia lentis and osteoporosis, vascular events remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in untreated patients. Recognized modalities of treatment include pyridoxine, in combination with folic acid and vitamin B12; methionine-restricted, cystine-supplemented diet; and betaine. The natural history of vascular events is such that half will have an event before age 30 years and there is a predicted one event per 25 years at the time of maximal risk. In 158 patients with 2822 patient-years of treatment, there would be a predicted 112 events if left untreated, but instead only 17 vascular events were recorded during treatment (relative risk 0.09, 95% CI 0.036 to 0.228; p &lt; 0.0001). Appropriate chronic treatment to lower hyperhomocysteinaemia is effective in reducing the potentially life-threatening vascular risk in patients with homocystinuria. These findings may also have relevance to the significance of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia that is commonly found in patients with premature vascular disease.

Hyperhomocysteinemia, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, results in an elevation of intimal hyperplasia (IH) following a carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in a rat model. An exaggerated IH response following CEA has been observed in rats with dietary induced hyperhomocysteinemia. Type 2 diabetics often present with hyperhomocysteinemia and are at higher risk for developing vascular blockage following surgical procedures. To determine if insulin resistance increases IH risks following endarterectomy, the 3 goals of this study were: (1) to establish plasma homocysteine concentrations in dietary induced insulin-resistant rats and their controls, (2) to investigate whether a positive correlation of IH and plasma homocysteine response occurs following CEA in the insulin-resistant rat model, and (3) if so, to attempt to decrease IH by supplementation with folic acid, a known enzymatic cofactor in the homocysteine metabolic pathway. To achieve these aims, male rats (275 to 300 g) were fed 1 of 4 diets for a 4-month period: (1) high-fat sucrose (HFS), (2) low-fat complex carbohydrate (LFCC), (3) HFS + 25 mg/kg folic acid (HFS+F), or (4) LFCC + 25 mg/kg folic acid (LFCC+F). At the end of the 4-month period the rats underwent an open (non-balloon) unilateral CEA. Two weeks post-endarterectomy, blood, liver and carotid tissue were removed to measure plasma insulin, folic acid, and homocysteine, 2 key enzymes of homocysteine metabolism-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS)-and percent lumenal stenosis (IH%). Computer-assisted morphometric analysis was used to measure the percentage of IH in the carotid artery. Plasma homocysteine was significantly higher in the HFS group when compared with the LFCC group (11.3+/-1.3 micromol/L v 7.4+/-0.6 mircomol/L, P=.008) as was post-endarterectomy IH producing lumenal stenosis (30.7%+/-4.2% v 14.0%+/-4.3%, P=.008). Plasma insulin in the HFS group was higher than the LFCC (control) group and was significant (36.3+/-3.0 microU/mL v 21.1+/-0.8 microU/mL, P=.0004). Folic acid supplementation in the HFS group resulted in reductions of plasma homocysteine (HFS v HFS+F, 11.3+/-1.3 micromol/L v 7.95+/-1.0 micromol/L, P=.02) and post-endarterectomy IH (HFS v HFS+F, 30.7%+/-4.2 % v 10.4%+/-1.6%, P=.0001). The control or LFCC group was not statistically different from the HFS+F group in homocysteine or IH. Folate supplementation did not decrease insulin concentrations in the HFS+F group compared to the LFCC group. We conclude that the HFS diet produced an insulin-resistant state with an elevated plasma homocysteine and an exaggerated IH response following carotid endarterectomy in this rat model. Dietary folate supplementation reduced plasma homocysteine concentrations in the HFS diet, which implicates hyperhomocysteinemia as an etiologic factor in the development of post-CEA IH in this insulin-resistant rat model.

Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disease characterized biochemically by increased blood and brain levels of homocysteine caused by severe deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase activity. Affected patients present mental retardation, seizures, and atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and vascular diseases, such Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the neurological damage characteristic of homocystinuria are still poorly understood. To evaluate the involvement of oxidative stress on the neurological dysfunction present in homocystinuria, we measured thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), an index of lipid peroxidation, and total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP) and antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) in rat hippocampus in the absence (controls) or in the presence of homocysteine (10-500 microM) in vitro. We demonstrated that homocysteine significantly increases TBARS and decreases TRAP, both in a dose-dependent manner, but did not change antioxidant enzymes. Our results suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the neurological dysfunction of homocystinuria. However, further studies are necessary to confirm and extend our findings to the human condition and also to determine whether antioxidant therapy may be of benefit to these patients.

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is considered as a risk factor for occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD). This concept is based on the observations of premature vascular disease in patients with homocystinuria and on the association between tHcy and increased risk of CVD in prospective studies. However, some observations have raised questions about tHcy as a risk factor. First, low risk population based prospective studies tend to indicate a weak association or no association between tHcy and CVD. Second, several traditional risk factors for CVD are associated with tHcy and may confound the relation between tHcy and CVD. Third, the C667T transition of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase causes a moderate increase in tHcy but no or only minor increased CVD risk. Thus, only placebo-controlled intervention studies with tHcy-lowering B-vitamins and clinical endpoints can provide additional valid arguments for the debate over whether tHcy is a causal CVD risk factor.

Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk of vascular disease. Homocysteine is a sulphur-containing amino acid whose metabolism stands at the intersection of two pathways: remethylation to methionine, which requires folate and vitamin B12 (or betaine in an alternative reaction); and transsulfuration to cystathionine which requires vitamin B6. The two pathways are coordinated by S-adenosylmethionine which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and as an activator of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Hyperhomocysteinemia arises from disrupted homocysteine metabolism. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia is due to rare genetic defects resulting in deficiencies in CBS, MTHFR, or in enzymes involved in methyl cobalamine synthesis and homocysteine methylation. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia seen in fasting condition is due to mild impairment in the methylation pathway (i.e. folate or B12 deficiencies or MTHFR thermolability). Post-methionine-load hyperhomocysteinaemia may be due to heterozygous cystathionine-beta-synthase defect or B6 deficiency. Patients with homocystinuria and severe hyperhomocysteinemia develop arterial thrombotic events, venous thromboembolism, and more seldom premature arteriosclerosis. Experimental evidence suggests that an increased concentration of homocysteine may result in vascular changes through several mechanisms. High levels of homocysteine induce sustained injury of arterial endothelial cells, proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells and enhance expression/activity of key participants in vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, and vulnerability of the established atherosclerotic plaque. These effects are supposed to be mediated through its oxidation and the concomitant production of reactive oxygen species. Other effects of homocysteine include: impaired generation and decreased bioavailability of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide; interference with many transcription factors and signal transduction; oxidation of low-density lipoproteins; lowering of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. In fact, the effect of elevated homocysteine appears multifactorial affecting both the vascular wall structure and the blood coagulation system.

Alterations of hepatic glutathione level by betaine were observed previously. In this study effects of betaine administration (1000 mg/kg, i.p.) on S-amino acid metabolism in rats and mice were investigated. Hepatic glutathione level decreased rapidly followed by marked elevation in 24 hr. Concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and methionine were increased whereas cystathionine decreased significantly, suggesting that homocysteine generated in the methionine cycle is preferentially remethylated to methionine rather than being utilized for synthesis of cysteine. Hepatic cysteine concentration declined immediately, but plasma cysteine increased. Effect of betaine on hepatic cysteine uptake was estimated from the difference in cysteine concentration in major blood vessels connected to liver. Cysteine concentration either in the portal vein or abdominal aorta was not altered, however, a significant increase was noted in the hepatic vein, indicating that hepatic uptake of cysteine was decreased by betaine treatment. Activities of glutamate cysteine ligase, cystathionine beta-synthase, and cystathionine gamma-lyase were elevated in 24 hr. Pretreatment with propargylglycine, an irreversible inhibitor of cystathionine gamma-lyase, did not abolish the betaine-induced reduction of hepatic glutathione in 4 hr, however, the elevation at t=24 hr was blocked completely. In conclusion the present results indicate that betaine administration induces time-dependent changes on hepatic metabolism of S-amino acids. Betaine enhances metabolic reactions in the methionine cycle, but inhibits cystathionine synthesis and cysteine uptake, leading to a decrease in supply of cysteine for glutathione synthesis. Reduction in glutathione is subsequently reversed due to induction of cysteine synthesis and glutamate cysteine ligase activity.

A modestly elevated total plasma homocysteine concentration (tHcy) is generally accepted as an independent and graded risk factor for various pathologies, including vascular diseases, neural tube defects, Alzheimer disease, and pregnancy complications. We analyzed 5 common functional polymorphisms in enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism (ie, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] 677C&gt;T and 1298A&gt;C, methionine synthase [MTR] 2756A&gt;G, cystathionine beta-synthase [CBS] 844ins68, and methionine synthase reductase [MTRR] 66A&gt;G) in 452 young adults, and quantified their independent and interactive effects on tHcy concentrations. Serum folate, red cell folate, vitamin B(12), and tHcy concentrations were significantly influenced by MTHFR 677C&gt;T genotypes. A particularly strong interaction was observed between the MTHFR 677TT genotype and serum folate, which led to a high tHcy phenotype that was more pronounced in males. The genetic contribution to the variance in tHcy was estimated to be approximately 9%, compared with approximately 35% that could be attributed to low folate and vitamin B(12). Our study indicates that dietary factors are centrally important in the control of tHcy levels in young adults with additional, but somewhat weaker, genetic effects. These data underscore the potential benefits that may be gained by improving the dietary status of young adults, and provide support for the implementation of folate/B-vitamin food fortification programs.

Atherosclerosis is an important medical problem of the 21st century, but traditional risk factors could only account for 50% of the problem. Hyperhomocysteinemia is emerging as an independent atherosclerosis risk factor, associated with folate deficiency, renal failure, and relative deficiency of MTHFR (C677T polymorphism) or other enzymes depending on gender, age, and smoking status. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to occur in 11-22% of western people, in 3-5% of normal asymptomatic Chinese subjects aged 18-70 years in Hong Kong, Macau, Sydney, and San Francisco, 23-36% of Chinese in Hong Kong with premature coronary artery disease, and 29% of a nonselective series of coronary subjects in Hong Kong. Evidence is accumulating that documents its associations with atherosclerosis disease in both case-control observations and prospective cohort studies, in vitro experiments, and in vivo experimental models in both animals and human subjects, as well as the successful improvement by homocysteine-lowering of endothelial function as surrogate atherosclerosis endpoints in asymptomatic human and coronary patients (secondary prevention). A number of large scale homocysteine-lowering trials are currently underway for stroke and heart attacks prevention. Collectively these trials will include more than 65,000 patients at high-risk for cardiovascular and stroke events, and should provide a reliable evidence-base for prevention.

To test the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia was due to increased levels of nitrotyrosine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in response to antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) -/+ mice were bred, tail tissue was analyzed for genotype by PCR, and tail vein blood was analyzed for homocysteine (Hcy) by spectrofluorometry. To induce PPAR-alpha, mice were administered 8 microg/ml of ciprofibrate (CF) and grouped: 1) wild type (WT), 2) WT + CF, 3) CBS, 4) CBS + CF (n = 6 in each group). In these four groups of mice, plasma Hcy was 3.0 +/- 0.2, 2.5 +/- 1.2, 15.2 +/- 2.6 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 11.0 +/- 2.9 micromol/l. Mouse urinary protein was 110 +/- 11, 86 +/- 6, 179 +/- 13, 127 +/- 9 microg.day(-1). kg(-1) by Bio-Rad dye binding assay. Aortic nitrotyrosine was 0.099 +/- 0.012, 0.024 +/- 0.004, 0.132 +/- 0.024 (P &lt; 0.01 compared with WT), 0.05 +/- 0.01 (scan unit) by Western analysis. MMP-2 activity was 0.053 +/- 0.010, 0.024 +/- 0.002, 0.039 +/- 0.009, 0.017 +/- 0.006 (scan unit) by zymography. MMP-9 was specifically induced in CBS -/+ mice and inhibited by CF treatment. Systolic blood pressure (SPB) was 90 +/- 2, 88 +/- 16, 104 +/- 8 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 96 +/- 3 mmHg. Aortic wall stress [(SPB. radius(2)/wall thickness)/2(radius + wall thickness)] was 10.2 +/- 1.9, 9.7 +/- 0.2, 16.6 +/- 0.8 (P &lt; 0.05 compared with WT), 13.1 +/- 2.1 dyn/cm(2). The results suggest that Hcy increased aortic wall stress by increasing nitrotyrosine and MMP-9 activity.

Hyperhomocysteinaemia is generally accepted as an independent and graded risk factor for both arterial occlusive disease and venous thrombosis. The only way of homocysteine degradation is conversion to cysteine in the transsulfuration pathway in which the regulating step is catalysed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Mild impairment of CBS function could therefore affect homocysteine concentration, in particular after methionine loading, and consequently cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We analysed two silent polymorphisms and one short tandem repeat in the CBS gene (ie 699C--&gt;T, 1080C--&gt;T and -5697 (GT) STR) as genetic markers potentially in linkage disequilibrium with a functional polymorphism. We assessed their association with fasting and post-methionine load homocysteine in 190 patients with arterial occlusive disease, and in 381 controls. No differences in CBS genotype frequencies between cases and controls were found, nor was a particular CBS genotype associated with an elevated risk of arterial occlusive disease. Although we did find a high rate of linkage disequilibrium between the two single nucleotide polymorphisms and the GT STR, none of the genotypes defined by the three CBS variants studied showed an association with elevated fasting, post-load or increase upon methionine loading homocysteine concentrations. In conclusion, we did not find any indication that genetic variation in the CBS gene is associated with increased homocysteine concentrations.

Although hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a direct role for homocysteine (Hcy) in this disease remains to be shown. Whereas diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia promotes atherosclerosis in animal models, the effects of Hcy on atherogenesis in the absence of dietary perturbations is not known. We have generated double knock-out mice with targeted deletions of the genes for apolipoprotein E (apoE) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which converts Hcy to cystathionine. ApoE(-/-)/CBS(-/-) mice developed aortic lesions even in the absence of dietary manipulation; lesion area and lesion cholesteryl ester (CE) and triglyceride (TG) contents increased with animal age and plasma Hcy levels. Plasma total cholesterol was significantly increased, whereas high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and TG concentrations of apoE(-/-)/CBS(-/-) mice were decreased. Cholesterol esterification and activities of enzymes catalyzing CE or TG formation in the vessel wall and in peritoneal macrophages were not changed by hyperhomocysteinemia. However, uptake of human acetyl-LDL, but not native low density lipoprotein (LDL), by mouse peritoneal macrophages was higher in the presence of hyperhomocysteinemia. These results suggest that isolated hyperhomocysteinemia is atherogenic and alters hepatic and macrophage lipoprotein metabolism, in part, by enhancing uptake of modified LDL.

We examined effects of hyperhomocysteinemia on structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles. We measured plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and pressure, diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall in maximally dilated cerebral arterioles in heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS(+/-)) mice and wild-type (CBS(+/+)) littermates that were provided with drinking water that was unsupplemented (control diet) or supplemented with 0.5% L-methionine (high-methionine diet). Plasma tHcy was 5.0+/-1.1 micro mol/L in CBS(+/+) mice and 8.3+/-0.9 micro mol/L in CBS(+/-) mice (P&lt;0.05 versus CBS(+/+) mice) fed the control diet. Plasma tHcy was 17.2+/-4.6 micro mol/L in CBS(+/+) mice and 21.2+/-3.9 micro mol/L in CBS(+/-) mice (P&lt;0.05) fed the high-methionine diet. Cross-sectional area of the vessel wall was significantly increased in CBS(+/-) (437+/-22 micro m(2)) mice fed control diet and CBS(+/+) (442+/-36 micro m(2)) and CBS(+/-) (471+/-46 micro m(2)) mice fed high-methionine diet relative to CBS(+/+) (324+/-18 micro m(2)) mice fed control diet (P&lt;0.05). During maximal dilatation, the stress-strain curves in cerebral arterioles of CBS(+/-) mice on control diet and CBS(+/+) and CBS(+/-) mice on high-methionine diet were shifted to the right of the curve in cerebral arterioles of CBS(+/+) mice on control diet, an indication that distensibility of cerebral arterioles was increased in mice with elevated levels of plasma tHcy. Thus, hyperhomocysteinemia in mice was associated with hypertrophy and an increase in distensibility of cerebral arterioles. These findings suggest that hyperhomocysteinemia promotes cerebral vascular hypertrophy and altered cerebral vascular mechanics, both of which may contribute to the increased incidence of stroke associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effects of short- and long-term vitamin C therapy on endothelial dysfunction in patients with homocystinuria.BACKGROUND: Untreated homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is associated with premature atherothrombotic disease; 25% of untreated patients suffer a vascular event by the age of 16 years and 50% by 29 years. Treatment directed at reducing homocysteine accumulation significantly reduces this risk. However, despite 'optimal' treatment and compliance, hyperhomocysteinaemia usually persists and individuals exhibit endothelial dysfunction indicative of an adverse cardiovascular prognosis. Additional intervention is therefore required to further reduce cardiovascular risk.METHODS: We investigated the endothelial effects of acute (2 g single dose) and chronic (1 g/day for 6 months) administration of oral vitamin C in 5 patients with homocystinuria (mean age 26 years, 1 male) and 5 age- and sex-matched controls. Brachial artery endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent responses to nitroglycerin (NTG) were measured using high-resolution ultrasonic vessel wall-tracking.RESULTS: Baseline: Plasma total homocysteine was 100.8 +/- 61.6 and 9.2 +/- 1.9 micromol/L in the patient and control groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). FMD responses were impaired in the patient group (20 +/- 40 microm) compared with the controls (116 +/- 30 microm) (p &lt; 0.001). Vitamin C administration: FMD responses in the patient group improved both acutely, 160 +/- 65 microm at 4 h (p &lt; 0.001), and chronically, 170 +/- 70 microm at 2 weeks (p &lt; 0.001) and 170 +/- 40 microm at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001). FMD responses in the control group were unaltered (p = 0.526). Within both groups, neither the vascular response to NTG nor plasma homocysteine was altered (p &gt; 0.4).CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in patients with homocystinuria, independent of changes in homocysteine concentration and should therefore be considered as an additional adjunct to therapy to reduce the potential long-term risk of atherothrombotic disease.

Elevated plasma homocysteine is associated with a variety of diseases in humans including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and birth defects. However, the mechanism by which plasma homocysteine affects cells is unknown. We have examined the growth of isogenic wild-type and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficient yeast in response to homocysteine and its immediate metabolic precursor, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). CBS deficient yeast export significantly more homocysteine into the media than wild-type yeast and have elevated internal pools of homocysteine and SAH. We found that 5 mM homocysteine added to the media had very little effect on the growth of wild-type or CBS deficient yeast, although intracellular homocysteine concentrations increased five- to tenfold. In contrast, as little as 25 microM S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibited the growth of CBS deficient yeast, but had no effect on wild-type yeast. Measurements of the intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAH indicate that CBS deficient yeast contain reduced SAM/SAH ratios relative to wild-type, and this ratio is further reduced by adding SAH to the media. Growth inhibition by SAH in CBS deficient yeast can be totally reversed by addition of SAM to the media, indicating that the ratio and not absolute level is critical for cell growth. These results suggest that CBS plays a key role in the regulation of the SAM/SAH ratio inside cells and that excessive perturbations of this ratio can inhibit growth. We hypothesize that elevated extracellular homocysteine present in humans may reflect an altered intracellular SAM/SAH ratio and that this may be related to disease pathogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease and analyze the relationship between plasma Hcy levels and the mutations in Hcy metabolism related enzymes, including methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, cystathionine beta-synthetase (CBS) 844ins68 and methionine synthetase (MS) A2756G.METHODS: By using the HPLC-FLD method, the plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration was determined in 86 patients with cerebral infarction, 66 with myocardial infarction and 80 healthy controls. The association of plasma tHcy levels with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and mutations of MTHFR C677T, CBS 844 ins 68 and MS A2756G were evaluated by statistic methods.RESULTS: In the patient groups, the plasma tHcy concentrations increased significantly as compared with healthy controls. The individuals homozygous for MTHFR C677T mutation had significantly higher plasma Hcy levels.CONCLUSION: Hyperhomocysteinemia is an important risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. The homozygosity of MTHFR C677T may contribute to the increase of plasma Hcy and vascular damage.

PURPOSE: Arterial or venous thromboses are frequent in patients with homocystinuria. Because severe homocystinuria is rare, prevalence of thrombosis, especially in France, is still unknown.METHODS: Review of the clinical outcome of 37 patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine-cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (34) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (three) lead us to describe vascular complications occurring in 12 (32%) of them.RESULTS: Venous thromboembolism is the earlier and the most frequent one and is mainly found in untreated late-diagnosed cases. Under specific treatment of homocystinuria, thromboses are rare and always a complication of surgery associated with high thromboembolic risk. Association with factor V Leiden increased the risk of venous thrombosis.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular disease, frequently observed in patients with severe renal impairment. Hyperhomocysteinemia has never been considered as a possible risk factor in renal artery stenosis. We investigated plasma folate and vitamin B12, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) 844ins68 polymorphisms, and homocysteine levels before and after methionine (100 mg/kg) loading in 58 patients with angiographically documented renal artery stenosis and mildly impaired renal function. One hundred and two normotensive subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries and no history or clinical or angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis in other vascular districts, were considered as a control group. Mean total homocysteine levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P&lt;0.01), as was the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (51.7% vs. 32.3%, P&lt;0.05). However, MTHFR alleles and genotypes as well as CBS 844ins68 mutation frequencies were similar in the two groups, whereas a lower folate level was observed in the patients. Moreover, patients with MTHFR A/A genotype showed a poorer folate status than control subjects, suggesting that a subclinical folate deficiency may be very frequent in renal artery stenosis, regardless of C677T mutation. In conclusions, hyperhomocysteinemia is common in patients with atheromatous renal artery stenosis; a subclinical folate deficiency seems to be involved, regardless of MTHFR thermolabile or CBS insertion genotypes. Folate supplementation might be useful in the management of overall vascular risk of these patients.

OBJECTIVES: Hyperhomocysteinemia is regarded as a public health problem of increasing importance likely to contribute to vascular disorders and premature mortality. Folate, cobalamin, pyridoxine, and riboflavin dietary deficiencies are currently regarded as causative factors. However, several investigations have indicated that the theory of vitamin B deprivation provides only a partial explanation for the observed abnormalities of sulfur-containing amino acids. We investigated the potential contributory role played by protein malnutrition.METHODS: For that purpose, three cohorts of 20 adult patients presenting stage I, II, and III goiter underwent careful medical history, dietary inquiry, and clinical examination. Their overall health and nutrition states were assessed with classic anthropometry, measurement of vitamin B blood parameters, visceral protein markers, essential amino acids, total homocysteine, and cystathionine.RESULTS: The concentrations of transthyretin, seven essential amino acids, and cystathionine progressively decreased as the thyroid gland increased. Methionine was the sole essential amino acid whose values did not change; total homocysteine was unique in that increased levels correlated negatively with transthyretin values. Taken together, the data point to a progressive deterioration of protein nutrition status impairing the transsulfuration pathway and is best explained by an acquired defect of cystathionine-beta-synthase activity.CONCLUSIONS: Hyperhomocysteinemia may arise from the shrinking of endogenous nitrogen pools as a result of decreased protein intake or stress-induced increased losses. Raised total homocysteine may result from the attempt of the malnourished and/or stressed body to preserve methionine homeostasis.

Homocystinuria is a genetically determined inborn error of the methionine amino acid pathway characterized by increased plasma homocysteine. In its major form, homocystinuria, is due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency. Treatment of these adulthood patients lead physicians to call up on the skilled advices of pediatricians. But prevention and treatment of age related vascular and osteoporotic complications are still to be evaluated.

Previous in vitro experiments have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia leads to oxidative inactivation of nitric oxide, in part by inhibiting the expression of cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1). To elucidate the role of intracellular redox status on homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidant stress, heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS(-/+)) and wild-type (CBS(+/+)) mice were treated with the cysteine donor L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC). CBS(-/+) mice had significantly lower GPx-1 activity compared with their CBS(+/+) littermates, and OTC treatment led to a modest increase in tissue GPx-1 activity and significant increases in total thiols and in reduced glutathione levels in both CBS(+/+) and CBS(-/+) mice. Superfusion of the mesentery with beta-methacholine or bradykinin produced dose-dependent vasodilation of mesenteric arterioles in CBS(+/+) mice and in CBS(+/+) mice treated with OTC. In contrast, mesenteric arterioles from CBS(-/+) mice manifested dose-dependent vasoconstriction in response to both agonists. OTC treatment of CBS(-/+) mice restored normal microvascular vasodilator reactivity to beta-methacholine and bradykinin. These findings demonstrate that mild hyperhomocysteinemia leads to endothelial dysfunction in association with decreased bioavailable nitric oxide. Increasing the cellular thiol and reduced glutathione pools and increasing GPx-1 activity restores endothelial function. These findings emphasize the importance of intracellular redox balance for nitric oxide bioactivity and endothelial function.

The influence of the genotype on the phenotypic expression of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is frequently unclear. We therefore investigated the genotype and the phenotype of CBS deficiency in two Austrian families also considering genetic polymorphisms with a putative association with vascular disease (MTHFR 677C--&gt;T, MTHFR 1298A--&gt;C, F5 1691G--&gt;A, F2 20210G--&gt;A) and response to therapy. We identified the CBS 833T--&gt;C/1058C--&gt;T and CBS 828ins104/1358del134 compound heterozygous genotype in our index patients. Both patients showed mental retardation and ectopia lentis. CBS 833T--&gt;C/1058C--&gt;T was associated with severe vascular complications, which was not the case for CBS 828ins104/1358del134. The patient with CBS 828ins104/1358del134 was negative for F5 1691G--&gt;A, F2 20210G--&gt;A, MTHFR 677C--&gt;T, and MTHFR 1298A--&gt;C, while the patient with CBS 833T--&gt;C/1058C--&gt;T was heterozygous for MTHFR 1298A--&gt;C. A combination therapy including pyridoxine, folic acid, hydroxycobalamin, and betaine failed to lower total homocysteine plasma levels below 50 mumol/L in both patients. In summary, our study demonstrates that the CBS 833C/1058T-MTHFR 1298AC genotype can be related to severe vascular disease, while the CBS 828ins104/1358del134-MTHFR 1298AA genotype presents with a somewhat milder clinical phenotype. Both genotypes do not allow for normalisation of total homocysteine plasma levels following vitamin therapy.

An inborn error of metabolism, homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, results in markedly elevated levels of circulating homocysteine. Premature vascular events are the main life-threatening complication. Half of all untreated patients have a vascular event by 30 years of age. We performed a multicenter observational study to assess the effectiveness of long-term homocysteine-lowering treatment in reducing vascular risk in 158 patients. Vascular outcomes were analyzed and effectiveness of treatment in reducing vascular risk was evaluated by comparison of actual to predicted number of vascular events, with the use of historical controls from a landmark study of 629 untreated patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. The 158 patients had a mean (range) age of 29.4 (4.5 to 70) years; 57 (36%) were more than 30 years old, and 10 (6%) were older than 50 years. There were 2822 patient-years of treatment, with an average of 17.9 years per patient. Plasma homocysteine levels were markedly reduced from pretreatment levels but usually remained moderately elevated. There were 17 vascular events in 12 patients at a mean (range) age of 42.5 (18 to 67) years: pulmonary embolism (n=3), myocardial infarction (n=2), deep venous thrombosis (n=5), cerebrovascular accident (n=3), transient ischemic attack (n=1), sagittal sinus thrombosis (n=1), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (n=2). Without treatment, 112 vascular events would have been expected, for a relative risk of 0.09 (95% CI 0.036 to 0.228; P&lt;0.0001). Treatment regimens designed to lower plasma homocysteine significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency despite imperfect biochemical control. These findings may be relevant to the significance of mild hyperhomocysteinemia that is commonly found in patients with vascular disease.

The mutations in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism-related enzyme genes including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) 844ins68, and methionine synthase (MS) A2756G have been identified as genetic risk factors for thromboembolic events. It has been noticed that these gene mutations have heterogeneous distributions among different ethnic groups or geographic areas. The data on the prevalence of the gene mutations in Chinese population is not yet available. In the present study, we have investigated the frequency of the MTHFR C677T, CBS 844ins68, and MS A2756G mutations in 102 patients with ischemic stroke (IS), 73 patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and 100 healthy controls. The distributive frequencies of the gene variations are as follows: In the IS, MI and control groups, the mutant homozygote for MTHFR C677T is 15 (14.7%), 8 (11.7%) and 16 (16.0%), respectively, and the T allele frequency is 37.7%, 33.6% and 39.5%, respectively; the heterozygote for CBS 844ins68 is 1 (1.0%), 1 (1.4%) and 5 (5.0%), respectively; the heterozygote for MS A2756G is 18 (17.6%), 14 (19.2%) and 17 (17.0%), and the G allele frequency is 8.8%, 11.0% and 9.5%, respectively. The carrier of both MS A2756G and MTHFR C677T (combined mutations) is 14 (12.7%), 8(11.0%) and 12(12.0%), respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between the patient groups and the control group in the frequencies of these single mutation or combined mutations. The heterozygosity of CBS 844ins68 yields an odds ratio (OR) of 0.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-1.43) for IS and 0.26 (95% CI 0.03-2.31) for MI. The T allele of MTHFR C677T yields an OR of 0.93 for IS (95% CI 0.62-1.39) and 0.77 for MI (95% CI 0.50-1.21). The G allele of MS A2756G yields an OR of 0.92(95% CI 0.47-1.81) for IS and 1.17 (95% CI 0.58-2.37) for MI. Our results suggest that neither single mutation nor combined mutations in MTHFR C677T, CBS 844ins68 and MS A2756G represent an independent risk factor for increasing IS and coronary artery disease risks in Chinese population. However, CBS 844ins68 may be a protective factor against vascular thromboembolic disease. The prevalence of CBS 844ins68 and MS A2756G in Chinese population is obviously lower than in Western Caucasian population.

Homocyst(e)ine (Hcy) inhibits the expression of the antioxidant enzyme cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) in vitro and in vivo, which can lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species that inactivate NO and promote endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of GPx-1 can restore the normal endothelial phenotype in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic states. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS((-/+))) mice and their wild-type littermates (CBS((+/+))) were crossbred with mice that overexpress GPx-1 [GPx-1((tg+)) mice]. GPx-1 activity was 28% lower in CBS((-/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) compared with CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) mice (P &lt; 0.05), and CBS((-/+)) and CBS((+/+)) mice overexpressing GPx-1 had 1.5-fold higher GPx-1 activity compared with GPx-1 nontransgenic mice (P &lt; 0.05). Mesenteric arterioles of CBS((-/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) mice showed vasoconstriction to superfusion with beta-methacholine and bradykinin (P &lt; 0.001 vs. all other groups), whereas nonhyperhomocyst(e)inemic mice [CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg-)) and CBS((+/+))/GPx-1((tg+)) mice] demonstrated dose-dependent vasodilation in response to both agonists. Overexpression of GPx-1 in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic mice restored the normal endothelium-dependent vasodilator response. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were transiently transfected with GPx-1 and incubated with dl-homocysteine (HcyH) or l-cysteine. HcyH incubation decreased GPx-1 activity in sham-transfected BAEC (P &lt; 0.005) but not in GPx-1-transfected cells. Nitric oxide release from BAEC was significantly decreased by HcyH but not cysteine, and GPx-1 overexpression attenuated this decrease. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of GPx-1 can compensate for the adverse effects of Hcy on endothelial function and suggest that the adverse vascular effects of Hcy are at least partly mediated by oxidative inactivation of NO.

Homocystinuria presenting as cerebral venous thrombosis is not usual. We report on a 13-year-old boy who was admitted to the hospital due to severe headache, nausea, vomiting and fever (38 degrees C). The patient was Marfan like and presented left hemiparesis and meningeal irritation sings. He was mentally retarded, had severe myopia, and had right lens dislocation one month before. Cranial CT scan was suggestive of cerebral venous infarct. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography showed venous infarcts more prominent in the right thalamic projection with hemorrhagic transformation and multiple foci of cortical (occipital and parietal bilaterally) deep parietal and left capsular bleeding, secondary of thrombosis of the transverse and sigmoid venous sinuses. High levels of homocysteine were detected in the blood and urine. Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive inborn error of methionine metabolism caused by cystathionine-beta-synthase defect in most cases. We discuss the clinical and radiological findings in this patient, analyzing the pathophysiology of the thrombotic events related to homocystinuria.

BACKGROUND: Severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (CbetaSD) is associated with early atherothrombotic vascular disease. Homocysteine may exert its effects by promoting oxidative damage. In the present study, we investigated whether in vivo formation of 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha), a platelet-active product of arachidonic acid peroxidation, is enhanced in CbetaSD and whether it correlates with in vivo platelet activation, as reflected by thromboxane (TX) metabolite excretion.METHODS AND RESULTS: Urine and blood samples were obtained from patients with homozygous CbetaSD (n=13) and age-matched healthy subjects. Urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) excretion was significantly higher in CbetaSD patients than in control subjects (640+/-384 versus 213+/-43 pg/mg creatinine; P=0.0015) and correlated with plasma homocysteine (rho=0.398, P=0.0076). Similarly, urinary 11-dehydro-TXB(2) excretion was enhanced in CbetaSD (1166+/-415 versus 324+/-72 pg/mg creatinine; P=0.0015) and correlated with urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) (rho=0.362, P=0.0153). Vitamin E supplementation (600 mg/d for 2 weeks) was associated with a statistically significant increase in its plasma levels (from 16.6+/-4.6 to 40.4+/-8.7 micromol/L, P=0.0002) and with reductions in 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) (from 790+/-159 to 559+/-111 pg/mg creatinine, P=0.018) and 11-dehydro-TXB(2) (from 1273+/-383 to 913+/-336 pg/mg creatinine, P=0.028). A statistically significant inverse correlation was found between urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and plasma vitamin E levels (rho=-0.745, P=0.0135).CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that enhanced peroxidation of arachidonic acid to form bioactive F(2)-isoprostanes may represent an important mechanism linking hyperhomocysteinemia and platelet activation in CbetaSD patients. Moreover, they provide a rationale for dose-finding studies of vitamin E supplementation in this setting.

Molecular defects in genes encoding enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism may account for mild hyperhomocysteinaemia, an independent and graded risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although heterozygosity for cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency has been excluded as a major genetic cause of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia in vascular disease, mutations in (non-)coding DNA sequences may lead to a mildly decreased CBS expression and, consequently, to elevated plasma homocysteine levels. We assessed the association between a 31 bp VNTR, that spans the exon 13-intron 13 boundary of the CBS gene, and fasting, post-methionine load and increase upon methionine load plasma homocysteine levels in 190 patients with arterial occlusive disease, and in 381 controls. The 31 bp VNTR consists of 16, 17, 18, 19 or 21 repeat units and shows a significant increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations with an increasing number of repeat elements, in particular after methionine loading. In 26 vascular disease patients the relationship between this 31 bp VNTR and CBS enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts was studied. The CBS enzyme activity decreased with increasing number of repeat units of the 31 bp VNTR. RT-PCR experiments showed evidence of alternative splicing at the exon 13-intron 13 splice junction site. The 31 bp VNTR in the CBS gene is associated with post-methionine load hyperhomocysteinaemia that may predispose individuals to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.

PURPOSE: The role that homocysteine may play in post-carotid endarterectomy (CEA) restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia is not well understood. This study was designed to investigate the effects of different levels of dietary homocystine on: (1) plasma homocysteine; (2) post-CEA intimal hyperplasia; and (3) levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and its counterpart S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in the homocysteine pathway.METHODS: Male rats were fed specialized diets for 2 weeks pre- and post-CEA. Groups included control (0 homocystine added, n=9), 1.5 (1.5 g/kg homocystine added, n=10), 3.0 (3.0 g/kg homocystine added, n=9), and 4.5 (4.5 g/kg homocystine added, n=11). The rats underwent a surgical carotid endarterectomy. Endpoints included; plasma homocysteine, intimal hyperplasia, replicative index using with alpha-SM actin and BrdU, hepatic SAM levels, SAH levels, and the hepatic activities of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS).RESULTS: Increasing dietary homocystine produced a proportionate increase in plasma homocysteine and an increase in intimal hyperplasia. Regression analysis of plasma homocysteine levels and intimal hyperplasia showed a significant correlation (r=0.71,P=0.003). Plasma homocysteine levels above 15 microM were associated with significant increases in intimal hyperplasia above 6.5% (P=0.04). Elevation of plasma homocysteine levels to moderate levels (5-25 microM) resulted in significant post-CEA intimal hyperplasia. Cellular analysis of the area of intimal hyperplasia in all diet groups showed comparable amounts of cells positive for alpha-SM actin. However, with increasing levels of dietary homocystine and plasma homocysteine there was an increase in replicative index (P&lt;0.001) as determined by BrdU staining. Increasing dietary homocystine increased plasma homocysteine and was followed by increases in the replicative index thus producing increased intimal hyperplasia and lumenal stenosis. In hepatic measurements the 1.5 and 3.0 g/kg homocystine diets caused: increased liver activity of MTHFR (P=0.03) and decreased hepatic levels of SAM, SAH and SAM/SAH ratios compared to controls. Homocystine treatment did not cause significant alterations in CBS levels (P=0.992). These studies also showed no correlation of the MTHFR and CBS enzymes with plasma homocysteine levels or intimal hyperplasia. However, hepatic levels of SAM showed significant negative correlations with plasma homocysteine (r=-0.58; P=0.006) and with BrdU percentages of cellular proliferation (r=-0.69; P=0.06).CONCLUSION: The degree of post-CEA intimal hyperplasia in a rat model is directly related to the plasma level of homocysteine. The hyperplastic effects of homocysteine may be mediated in part by a physiological insufficiency of methyl donors as shown by decreases in SAM. Thus, increasing levels of plasma homocysteine enhanced and accelerated the smooth muscle cell response after CEA which led to increased intimal hyperplasia and lumenal stenosis.

Elevated plasma homocysteine is a new risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease resulting in progressive atherogenesis in the arteries of the limbs, the coronary arteries and the cerebrovascular system. Hyperhomocysteinemia may be induced by failure or decreased enzyme activity of the cystathionine-beta-synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase due to genetic mutation or deficiency of folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6. Oxidation of homocysteine to homocystine is accompanied with production of hydrogen peroxide inducing damage of endothelium through oxidative stress. The injury of the endothelium by homocysteine can be shown by measuring flow-induced vasodilation in men. The abnormalities of coagulation found in hyperhomocysteinemia is related to the impairment of the function of endothelial cells and inhibition of the thrombomodulin-protein C and glycosaminoglycan-antithrombin-III anticoagulant system. Homocysteine decreases the level of glutathione peroxidase in the endothelial cells, and inhibits its activation leading to the impairment of oxidative defensive mechanism, and to the free radical-induced NO-inactivation. In decreasing of plasma homocysteine level and preventing its influence on endothelium, moreover in improving of endothelial function the folic acid has cardinal importance, however the vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 also play role in the maintenance of normal homocysteine level of blood.

Classical homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is one of the disorders revealing a high risk of thromboembolic events and vascular disease. This autosomal-recessively inherited metabolic disorder is considered to be rare with an estimated prevalence of 1:130,000 in the German population. In this study, we developed a novel multiplex PCR generating allele specific fragment lengths to analyse individual genotypes of the two most frequent cystathionine beta-synthase alterations, the I278T mutation, which is worldwide found on up to the half of homocystinuric alleles, and the adjacent polymorphism 844ins68. Screening of 200 unrelated German control subjects revealed a frequency of heterozygosity of 1.5% for 1278T corresponding to a calculated frequency of homozygosity of 1:17.800. Our data indicate that homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is a frequently unrecognized disorder resulting in a high risk of thromboembolic events.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Family history of vascular disease is an important risk factor for vascular disease, independent of conventional risk factors. Homocysteinemia, a newly defined risk factor, is caused by genetics, such as cystathionine beta synthase deficiencies, and metabolic deficiencies. With the present work we intend to study the influence of family history of vascular disease in homocysteinemia.METHODS: We studied 204 normal persons (153 males), average age 38.7 +/- 10.9 years, in terms of family history of vascular disease (death due to myocardial infarction or a stroke), conventional risk factors, routine laboratory tests, fasting homocysteinemia and after oral methionine loading (0.1 g/Kg body weight). We compared laboratory results, conventional risk factors and homocysteinemia levels in persons with and without a family history of vascular disease. We performed covariance analysis to evaluate, in a multivariate model, factors that were related to basal or after methionine loading homocysteinemia.RESULTS: 35% of persons presented a family history of vascular disease (FHVD). Persons with FHVD presented higher age (45.6 +/- 8.9 versus 35.0 +/- 10.1, p &lt; 0.001), and higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.002), dyslipidemia (p = 0.001), obesity (p = 0.03), and physical inactivity (p = 0.03). They presented a tendency, without statistical significance, to have a higher prevalence of diabetes and of hyperhomocysteinemia, and to present higher levels of basal and afterload homocysteinemia. Performing covariance analysis, basal homocysteinemia did not present any relation to FHVD. After methionine load homocysteinemia was strongly influenced by basal homocysteinemia (p = 0.0000), and significantly related to FHVD (p = 0.039).CONCLUSIONS: Homocysteinemia cannot explain most of the risk of family history of vascular disease, not explained by conventional risk factors. The only significant relationship between homocysteinemia and FHVD was observed with afterload homocysteinemia in the multivariate model. FHVD is clearly related to conventional risk factors.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, but it is not certain whether it is a mediator of vascular dysfunction or a marker for another risk factor. Homocysteine levels are regulated by folate bioavailability and also by the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and its metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). We tested the hypotheses that endothelial dysfunction occurs in hyperhomocysteinemic mice in the absence of folate deficiency and that levels of SAM and SAH are altered in mice with dysfunction. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient (CBS(+/-)) and wild-type (CBS(+/+)) mice were fed a folate-replete, methionine-enriched diet. Plasma levels of total homocysteine were elevated in CBS(+/-) mice compared with CBS(+/+) mice after 7 weeks (27.1+/-5.2 versus 8.8+/-1.1 micromol/L; P&lt;0.001) and 15 weeks (23.9+/-3.0 versus 13.0+/-2.3 micromol/L; P&lt;0.01). After 15 weeks, but not 7 weeks, relaxation of aortic rings to acetylcholine was selectively impaired by 35% (P&lt;0.05) and thrombomodulin anticoagulant activity was decreased by 20% (P&lt;0.05) in CBS(+/-) mice. Plasma levels of folate did not differ between groups. Levels of SAH were elevated approximately 2-fold in liver and brain of CBS(+/-) mice, and correlations were observed between plasma total homocysteine and SAH in liver (r=0.54; P&lt;0.001) and brain (r=0.67; P&lt;0.001). These results indicate that endothelial dysfunction occurs in hyperhomocysteinemic mice even in the absence of folate deficiency. Endothelial dysfunction in CBS(+/-) mice was associated with increased tissue levels of SAH, which suggests that altered SAM-dependent methylation may contribute to vascular dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Homocysteine is a sulfhydryl containing amino acid which is produced as an intermediate product in the metabolism of the essential amino acid methionine. Apart from environmental factors such as the intake of folate and other B vitamins, the level of homocysteine in the blood is determined by the genetically based activities of several enzymes involved in the methionine or folate cycle. The well-known congenital defect homocystinuria is due to homozygosity for mutated cystathionine beta synthase. It is characterized by severe hyperhomocysteinemia, which leads to arterial and venous disease at a very young age. Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, due to either heterozygosity for severe mutations in the genes of enzymes involved or based upon homozygosity for more mild mutations, has also been recognized as a risk factor for vascular disease in the last decade. However, ongoing clinical intervention studies still need to demonstrate a casual role of mildly increased homocysteine levels in vascular disease.

Hepatic steatosis is common in patients having severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency for cystathionine beta-synthase. However, the mechanism by which homocysteine promotes the development and progression of hepatic steatosis is unknown. We report here that homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates both the unfolded protein response and the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in cultured human hepatocytes as well as vascular endothelial and aortic smooth muscle cells. Activation of the SREBPs is associated with increased expression of genes responsible for cholesterol/triglyceride biosynthesis and uptake and with intracellular accumulation of cholesterol. Homocysteine-induced gene expression was inhibited by overexpression of the ER chaperone, GRP78/BiP, thus demonstrating a direct role of ER stress in the activation of cholesterol/triglyceride biosynthesis. Consistent with these in vitro findings, cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly elevated in the livers, but not plasmas, of mice having diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia. This effect was not due to impaired hepatic export of lipids because secretion of VLDL-triglyceride was increased in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. These findings suggest a mechanism by which homocysteine-induced ER stress causes dysregulation of the endogenous sterol response pathway, leading to increased hepatic biosynthesis and uptake of cholesterol and triglycerides. Furthermore, this mechanism likely explains the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and possibly atherosclerotic lesions observed in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Based on recent retrospective, prospective, and experimental studies, mild to moderate elevation of fasting or postmethionine-load plasma homocysteine is accepted as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and thrombosis in both men and women. Hyperhomocysteinemia results from an inhibition of the remethylation pathway or from an inhibition or a saturation of the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine metabolism. The involvement of a high dietary intake of methionine-rich animal proteins has not yet been investigated and cannot be ruled out. However, folate deficiency, either associated or not associated with the thermolabile mutation of the N(5,10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and vitamin B(6) deficiency, perhaps associated with cystathionine beta-synthase defects or with methionine excess, are believed to be major determinants of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease related to hyperhomocysteinemia. Recent experimental studies have suggested that moderately elevated homocysteine levels are a causal risk factor for atherothrombotic disease because they affect both the vascular wall structure and the blood coagulation system. The oxidant stress that results from impaired homocysteine metabolism, which modifies the intracellular redox status, might play a central role in the molecular mechanisms underlying moderate hyperhomocysteinemia-mediated vascular disorders. Because folate supplementation can efficiently reduce plasma homocysteine levels, both in the fasting state and after methionine loading, results from further prospective cohort studies and from on-going interventional trials will determine whether homocysteine-lowering therapies can contribute to the prevention and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Additionally, these studies will provide unequivocal arguments for the independent and causal relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and atherothrombotic disease.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between preeclampsia and 3 relatively common mutations that are important in the development of vascular disease and thrombosis; these are similar to conditions observed in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.STUDY DESIGN: Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from whole blood or cheek swabs of 281 patients with preeclampsia and 360 control subjects (all white). Control subjects consisted of women who had undergone at least 2 term pregnancies unaffected by preeclampsia. Mutation frequencies among patients with preeclampsia and control subjects were compared by standard chi2 analysis, with P &lt;.05 considered significant.RESULTS: Thirty-three of 281 women with preeclampsia (11.7%) and 22 of 193 women with severe preeclampsia (11.4%) were homozygous for cytosine-to-thymine substitution at nucleotide 677 in the gene for methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), versus 41 of 360 control subjects (11.4%; difference not significant). Forty of 258 women with preeclampsia (15.5%) and 22 of 175 women with severe preeclampsia (12.6%) were heterozygous for the insertion of 68 bases at position 844 in the gene for cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), versus 58 of 332 control subjects (17.5%). Fifteen of 250 women with preeclampsia (6.0%) and 11 of 169 with severe preeclampsia (6.5%) were heterozygous for the Leiden mutation (glycine-to-alanine substitution at nucleotide 1691) in the gene for factor V (F5), versus 12 of 253 control subjects (4.7%; difference not significant).CONCLUSION: In this white population a missense mutation of MTHFR, an insertion mutation of CBS, and a missense mutation of F5 were not found to be associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia, either independently or in combination.

BACKGROUND: Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of methionine metabolism. It manifests with vascular, central nervous system and connective tissue disturbances, and phenotypically resembles Marfan's syndrome. We analysed the clinical course of homocystinuria in Czech and Slovak patients.METHODS AND RESULTS: The group of homocystinuric patients consisted of 19 individuals (12 males and 7 females) aged 5-32 years (average age 18 years), who were diagnosed between 1980 and 1999. The overall incidence of homocystinuria in the Czech and Slovak Republics was 1:287,000. The proportion of pyridoxine-responsive patients was 47%. The average follow-up period was 10 years (range 1 month to 19 years). The prevalence of the individual signs in the group was as follows: lens dislocation--95% of patients, progressive myopia--79%, marfanoid habitus--74%, kyfoscoliosis--68%, osteoporosis--63%, psychomotor retardation--58%, other neurologic symptomatology--58% and tromboembolism--21%. The average delay between the first sign of the disease and the time when the diagnosis was made was 4 years (range 1 to 14 years). At the time of diagnosis the average levels of metabolites in plasma were as follows: total homocysteine 348 mumol/l (range 211-536), free homocystine 70 mumol/l (range 0-203) and methionine 359 mumol/l (range 75-937).CONCLUSIONS: Both the clinical course of homocystinuria due to the cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and its incidence in the Czech and Slovak Republics are similar to those in other populations. Since homocystinuria is a treatable disease, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome, tromboembolism and severe psychomotor retardation.

BACKGROUND: The use of Isotretinoin (Iso) for cystic acne (CA) therapy includes marked side-effects such as dyslipidemia, increased liver enzymes, and reduction of biotinidase activity. Moreover, Homocysteine (Hcy), an amino acid, is metabolized in the liver requiring folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and the activity of enzymes, i.e. cystathionine-beta-synthase. Increased blood levels of Hcy are associated with premature occlusive vascular disease.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the evaluation of Hcy levels and the responsible vitamins for its metabolism in patients with CA on Iso treatment.METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with CA were submitted to laboratory examinations before (Value 1) and after (Value 2) 45 days on Iso (0.5 mg/kg/24 h) therapy. Blood levels of Hcy and vitamin B6 were evaluated by HPLC methods, and folate and vitamin B12 using a commercial Kit. Hcy levels (Value 1 = 7.86 +/- 1.6 micromol/L; Value 2 = 13.65 +/- 3.3 micromol/L; P &lt; 0.001) were statistically significantly increased in patients on treatment. Vitamins were unaltered, and lipids and liver enzymes increased. Significant correlation between Hcy levels, vitamins, and liver enzymes was found. Methionine loading tests performed in nine patient-volunteers showed an abnormal response post-treatment.CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the elevated Hcy levels in patients after 45 days on Iso therapy could be due either to the 'inhibition' of cystathionine-beta-synthase by the drug and/or their liver dysfunction. Daily vitamin supplementation along with frequent evaluations of Hcy blood levels are recommended for the prevention of a premature occlusive vascular disease.

Over the last decade mild hyperhomocysteinaemia has widely been recognised as a new risk factor for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. Main regulating enzymes of homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism are cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), methionine synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Early studies on patients with vascular disease described elevated Hcy concentrations after methionine loading and decreased CBS activity, resembling heterozygotes for CBS deficiency. Therefore, heterozygosity for CBS deficiency was proposed as the main cause of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia. However, more recent enzymatic and molecular genetic studies have demonstrated that heterozygosity for CBS deficiency is not or only a very minor cause of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia in vascular disease. We discovered two common genetic causes of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia, the 677C &gt; T and the 1298A &gt; C mutations in the coding region of MTHFR. The 677C &gt; T mutation causes reduced enzyme activity with thermolabile protein properties, elevated Hcy and low-normal or decreased plasma folate levels. The 1298A &gt; C mutation relates also to decreased enzyme activity, but not to thermolabile protein, and Hcy and folate levels are not influenced. However, compound heterozygosity for these two mutations, i.e. individuals with the 677CT/1298AC genotype, have elevated Hcy and decreased plasma folate levels. Gene-enviroment interactions between 677C &gt; T and folate is demonstrated in individuals with the 677TT genotype. Those with low-normal folate have elevated Hcy, whereas those with high-normal folate have normal Hcy concentrations. The elevated Hcy levels due to these mutations can be normalised by administration of folate, but whether folate reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease remains to be established.</AbstractText>: Over the last decade mild hyperhomocysteinaemia has widely been recognised as a new risk factor for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis.

The current data on mutations in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene do not tell us whether elevated plasma homocysteine plays a causal role in vascular disease. Low cellular vitamin status may be a possible cause and homocysteine may just be a marker for this situation.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a unique heme enzyme that catalyzes a PLP-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine. Deficiency of CBS leads to homocystinuria, an autosomal recessively inherited disease of sulfur metabolism. A truncated form of CBS in which the C-terminal amino-acid residues have been deleted has been prepared. The truncated CBS subunits form a dimer, in contrast to the full-length subunits which form tetramers and higher oligomers. The truncated CBS yielded crystals diffracting to 2.6 A which belong to space group P3(1) or P3(2). This is the first comprehensive structural investigation of a PLP and heme-containing enzyme.

Homocystinuria (HCU) due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency leads to severe hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). Vascular events (VE) remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the untreated patients with HCU. The study on the natural history of untreated HCU disclosed that, at the time of maximal risk, in other words beyond 10 years old, there was one event per 25 years. Recent studies from Australia (n = 32), The Netherlands (n = 28), and Ireland (n = 24) have documented the effects of long-term treatment on the vascular outcome of a total of 84 patients with 1314 patient-years of treatment for HCU. The mean (range) age was 27.8 (2.5 to 70) years. Five VE were recorded during treatment; one pulmonary embolism, two myocardial infarctions, and two abdominal aneurysms. All five VE occurred in B6-responsive patients at a mean (range) age of 48.8 (30 to 60) years. In 1314 patient-years of treatment, 53 VE would have been expected if they remained untreated; instead only 5 were documented, relative risk = 0.091 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.043 to 0.190; p &lt; 0.001). Appropriate homocysteine-lowering therapy for severe HHcy significantly reduced the vascular risk in patients with HCU. VE were rare with treatment despite the fact that the post-treatment homocysteine levels were several times higher than the cutoff point for homocysteine in the normal population. The present findings may have relevance to the current concept of &quot;mild HHcy&quot; as a risk factor for vascular disease, with elevated plasma homocysteine levels considerably lower than that of the post-treatment levels in this group of reported patients.

With the identification of hyperhomocysteinemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, an understanding of the genetic determinants of plasma homocysteine is important for prevention and treatment. It has been known for some time that homocystinuria, a rare inborn error of metabolism, can be due to genetic mutations that severely disrupt homocysteine metabolism. A more recent development is the finding that milder, but more common, genetic mutations in the same enzymes might also contribute to an elevation in plasma homocysteine. The best example of this concept is a missense mutation (alanine to valine) at base pair (bp) 677 of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), the enzyme that provides the folate derivative for conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This mutation results in mild hyperhomocysteinemia, primarily when folate levels are low, providing a rationale (folate supplementation) for overcoming the genetic deficiency. Additional genetic variants in MTHFR and in other enzymes of homocysteine metabolism are being identified as the cDNAs/genes become isolated. These variants include a glutamate to alanine mutation (bp 1298) in MTHFR, an aspartate to glycine mutation (bp 2756) in methionine synthase, and an isoleucine to methionine mutation (bp 66) in methionine synthase reductase. These variants have been identified relatively recently; therefore additional investigations are required to determine their clinical significance with respect to mild hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular disease.

Over the last 30 years, a growing body of evidence has documented the role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) as an independent vascular risk factor. However, the mechanisms through which elevated circulating levels of homocysteine (Hcy) cause vascular injury and promote thrombosis remain elusive. Most findings have been achieved in in vitro studies employing exceedingly high concentrations of Hcy, whereas only a few studies have been carried out in vivo in humans. In homocystinuric patients, homozygotes for mutations of the gene coding for the cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme, abnormalities of coagulation variables reflecting a hypercoagulable state, have been reported. In vitro studies provide a biochemical background for such a state. In homocystinuric patients, an in vivo platelet activation has also been reported. The latter abnormality is not corrected by the bolus infusion of concentrations of hirudin, which determines a long-lasting impairment of the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin; in contrast, it appears at least in part lowered by the administration of the antioxidant drug probucol. During the autooxidation of Hcy in plasma, reactive oxygen species are generated. The latter initiate lipid peroxidation in cell membranes (potentially responsible for endothelial dysfunction) and in circulating lipoproteins. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) may trigger platelet activation as well as some of the hemostatic abnormalities reported in such patients. Thus the oxidative stress induced by Hcy may be a key process in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in HHcy. Accumulation of adenosylhomocysteine in cells (a consequence of high circulating levels of homocysteine) inhibits methyltransferase enzymes, in turn preventing repair of aged or damaged cells. This mechanism has been recently documented in patients with renal failure and HHcy and provides an additional direction to be followed to understand the tendency to thrombosis in moderate HHcy.

Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thrombosis. Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with impaired endothelial function, but the mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction in hyperhomocysteinemia are poorly understood. We have used genetic and dietary approaches to produce hyperhomocysteinemia in mice. Heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice (CBS +/-), which have a selective defect in homocysteine transsulfuration, and wild-type (CBS +/+) littermates were fed either a control diet or a diet that is relatively deficient in folic acid for 6 wk. Plasma total homocysteine was 5.3 +/- 0.7 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 6.4 +/- 0.6 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.3) given the control diet. Plasma total homocysteine was 11.6 +/- 4.5 microM in CBS +/+ mice and 25.1 +/- 3.2 microM in CBS +/- mice (P = 0.004) given a low-folate diet. In mice fed the control diet, relaxation of aortic rings in response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine did not differ significantly between CBS +/+ mice and CBS +/- mice. In contrast, in mice fed a low-folate diet, maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was markedly impaired in CBS +/- mice (58 +/- 9%) compared with CBS +/+ mice (84 +/- 4%) (P = 0.01). No differences in relaxation to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside were observed among the four groups of mice. These data indicate that CBS-deficient mice are predisposed to hyperhomocysteinemia during dietary folate deficiency, and moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with marked impairment of endothelial function in mice.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism that has pleiotropic manifestations and is commonly called &quot;homocystinuria.&quot; The features include skeletal, ocular, and vascular defects, some of which are reminiscent of those found in Marfan syndrome (MFS). Because of the spectrum of clinical effects, the pathogenesis of homocystinuria has long been thought to involve the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the condition has been classified as a heritable disorder of connective tissue. Because of the superficial similarities with MFS, we and others (Pyeritz, in McKusicks Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue, St. Louis, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 5th ed., pp 137-178, 1993; Pyeritz, in Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics, New York, Churchill Livingstone, 3rd ed., pp 1027-1066, 1997; Mudd, Levy, and Skovby, in The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, New York, McGraw-Hill Publishing Co., 7th ed., pp 1279-1327, 1995) have speculated how CBS deficiency might affect fibrillin-1, the protein altered in MFS. For example, the altered plasma concentrations of homocysteine and/or cysteine in patients with CBS deficiency may hinder fibrillin-1 synthesis, deposition, or both. When arterial smooth muscle cells were cultured under conditions of cysteine deficiency, fibrillin-1 deposition into the ECM was greatly diminished as revealed by immunocytochemistry. Excessive homocysteine, in contrast, had little, if any, effect on fibrillin-1 deposition. When cysteine concentrations were returned to normal, the smooth muscle cells began to accumulate a matrix rich in fibrillin-1. Type I collagen, the major matrix component synthesized by these smooth muscle cells, was not reduced by low cysteine concentrations nor high homocysteine concentrations. These results demonstrate that a deficiency of cysteine and subsequent inhibition of fibrillin-1 accumulation in CBS deficient patients may be at least partly responsible for their phenotype, and suggest that maintenance of normal plasma cyst(e)ine levels may be an important therapeutic goal.

Homocysteine is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications. We have employed an animal model to explore the hypothesis that an increase in reactive oxygen species and a subsequent loss of nitric oxide bioactivity contribute to endothelial dysfunction in mild hyperhomocysteinemia. We examined endothelial function and in vivo oxidant burden in mice heterozygous for a deletion in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, by studying isolated, precontracted aortic rings and mesenteric arterioles in situ. CBS(-/+) mice demonstrated impaired acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation and a paradoxical vasoconstriction of mesenteric microvessels in response to superfusion of methacholine and bradykinin. Cyclic GMP accumulation following acetylcholine treatment was also impaired in isolated aortic segments from CBS(-/+) mice, but aortic relaxation and mesenteric arteriolar dilation in response to sodium nitroprusside were similar to wild-type. Plasma levels of 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) (8-IP) were somewhat increased in CBS(-/+) mice, but liver levels of 8-IP and phospholipid hydroperoxides, another marker of oxidative stress, were normal. Aortic tissue from CBS(-/+) mice also demonstrated greater superoxide production and greater immunostaining for 3-nitrotyrosine, particularly on the endothelial surface. Importantly, endothelial dysfunction appears early in CBS(-/+) mice in the absence of structural arterial abnormalities. Hence, mild hyperhomocysteinemia due to reduced CBS expression impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation, likely due to impaired nitric oxide bioactivity, and increased oxidative stress apparently contributes to inactivating nitric oxide in chronic, mild hyperhomocysteinemia.

Although the major biochemical abnormality due to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency is hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, its pathogenicity appears to involve more than homocysteine toxicity. In patients with severe MTHFR deficiency, a metabolite(s) other than hyperhomocyst(e)inemia also appears to be associated with its clinical manifestation in cerebrovascular disease. To elucidate the specific role of the TT genotype of MTHFR in the development of cerebral infarction with and without cognitive impairment, we determined the prevalence of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia and the C677T genotypes of MTHFR in 143 patients with vascular dementia, 122 patients with cerebral infarction, and 217 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Prevalence of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia [homocyst(e)ine &gt;/=15 micromol/L] was higher in cerebrovascular patients with or without dementia than in normal control subjects (42.6%, 20.5%, and 10.1%, respectively; P=0.001). In contrast, a higher frequency of MTHFR TT genotype was found only in demented patients compared with nondemented patients and healthy controls (25.2%, 9.8%, and 12.0%, respectively; P=0.01). When the study subjects were divided into normohomocyst(e)inemic and hyperhomocyst(e)inemic groups, the TT genotype was significantly associated with the risk for vascular dementia in the hyperhomocyst(e)inemic group (odds ratio 4.13, 95% CI 2.18 to 7.85; P=0.03) but not in the normohomocyst(e)inemic group. Demented patients with multiple infarcts had a higher frequency of TT genotype (odds ratio 3.13, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.39; P=0.0007), whereas those with a single infarct did not (odds ratio 2.03, P=0.15). In contrast, there was no significant association of the TT genotype with multiple infarcts in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic stroke patients. Taken together, these findings indicate a possible role of MTHFR TT genotype combined with hyperhomocyst(e)inemia in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. Similar to the relationship between homocystinuria due to severe MTHFR deficiency and severe cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, the TT genotype of MTHFR in hyperhomocyst(e)inemic subjects is differentiated from the cases of the TT genotype without hyperhomocyst(e)inemia or hyperhomocyst(e)inemia without the TT genotype in the development of cerebrovascular disease.

Homocysteine is a sulphur-containing amino acid that is derived primarily from protein of animal origin. Classical homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disorder that arises from defects in either the re-methylation or trans-sulphuration pathways of homocysteine metabolism and leads to skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation and a high risk of vascular disease. In contrast, moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia is associated with an increased risk of both arterial and venous thrombotic disease but no other abnormalities. This increased risk appears to be independent of other conventional risk factors. Many cases of hyperhomocysteineaemia have been attributed to defects in the enzyme cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) but this accounts for less than 1.5% of cases. A thermolabile variant of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) arises from a C --&gt; T transition at nucleotide 677 in the MTHFR gene resulting in an alanine-to-valine substitution. While the mutation does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of vascular disease, it results in excessively high homocysteine levels in response to a low or low-normal serum folate. Supplementation of the diet with folate, B6 and B12 can reduce homocysteine levels and this is the mainstay of treatment. Supplementation of grain with folate is undertaken in the USA to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in pregnant women. However, by reducing plasma homocysteine levels, it is estimated that this will save up to 50,000 lives per annum.

Elevated total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) is an established risk factor for the development of vascular disease and neural tube defects. Total homocysteine levels can be lowered by folic acid supplements but individual response is highly variable. In this case-control study, involving 142 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 102 controls, we have typed six genetic polymorphisms in three homocysteine metabolizing genes and examined their relationship to the incidence of CAD, tHcy levels, and lowering of tHcy levels in response to folic acid supplementation. We found that two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) gene, 699C --&gt; T and 1080T --&gt; C, are associated with decreased risk of CAD and increased responsiveness to the tHcy lowering effects of folic acid. Individuals homozygous for 699T were significantly underrepresented in CAD patients as compared to controls (4.9% vs 17.3%, P = 0.0015), as were individuals homozygous for the 1080C (29.6% vs 44.2%, P = 0.018). Additionally, 699T and 1080C homozygous individuals were the most responsive to folate supplementation. 699T homozygotes lowered tHcy levels 13.6% on average, compared to 4.8% lowering in 699C homozygotes (P = 0.009), while 1080C homozygotes lowered 12.9% compared to just 2.7% for 1080T homozygotes (P = 0.005). The two polymorphisms in CBS are third codon changes and would not be predicted to affect the underlying protein. However, there is strong linkage disequilibrium between these two positions, suggesting that they may also be linked to other as yet unidentified polymorphisms within the CBS gene. These observations suggest that specific CBS alleles are a risk factor for the development of vascular disease and that genetic information could be predictive of individual response to folic acid supplementation.

Thrombotic events are a well-recognized complication of homocystinuria. However, the mechanisms involved in the atherogenic and thrombotic effects of homocyst(e)ine remain incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to determine the role of endothelial cell activation/damage as indicated by levels of thrombomodulin, tissue factor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and factor VII activity in patients with homocystinuria. Six patients with homocystinuria, nonresponsive to pyridoxine, treated only with trimethylglycine (betaine) were injected with a bolus of 20 IU/kg body weight of unfractionated commercial heparin to induce the release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from the vascular endothelium. Tissue factor, thrombomodulin, and factor VII activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and clotting assay before heparin administration. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor antigen and activity were measured before and 5 minutes after the bolus of heparin. Levels of homocyst(e)ine were elevated (patients: 144.2+/-19.2 micromol/L; controls: 10.2+/-0.9 micromol/L); however, levels of thrombomodulin, tissue factor, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor antigen were not statistically different from the control group. In contrast, tissue factor pathway inhibitor activity showed a significantly increased level (patients: 2.09+/-0.34 U/L; controls: 1.14+/-0.20 U/L; p&lt;0.05) that was correlated with homocyst(e)ine. Factor VII activity was significantly decreased (patients: 64.7+/-5.1%; controls: 91.4+/-4.7%; p&lt;0.05) and inversely correlated with homocyst(e)ine. After heparin the patients released higher amounts of tissue factor pathway inhibitor antigen and activity compared with the control group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Although not treated with antithrombotic drugs, none of the patients had any thromboembolic complications after starting betaine. In addition to betaine treatment, the enhanced factor pathway inhibitor antigen activity observed in this small series of patients suggests that factor pathway inhibitor antigen may play an additional, as yet unexplained, role in this genetic disorder.

A modest homocysteine elevation is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Marked circulating homocysteine elevations occur in homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CbetaS) deficiency, a disorder associated with a greatly enhanced cardiovascular risk. Lowering homocysteine levels reduces this risk significantly. Because homocysteine-induced oxidative damage may contribute to vascular changes and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is an important antioxidant in vascular tissue, we assessed EC-SOD and homocysteine in patients with homocystinuria. We measured circulating EC-SOD, total homocysteine (free plus bound), and methionine levels during the treatment of 21 patients with homocystinuria, 18 due to CbetaS deficiency, aged 8 to 59 years, and 3 with remethylating defects. We measured total homocysteine by immunoassay, EC-SOD by ELISA, and methionine by amino acid analysis and assessed interindividual and intraindividual relationships. There was a significant, positive relationship between EC-SOD and total homocysteine. For the interindividual assessment, levels were highly correlated, r=0.746, N=21, P&lt;0.0001. This relationship was maintained after taking into account intraindividual patient variation (r=0.607, N=62, P&lt;0.0001). In 2 newly diagnosed CbetaS-deficient patients, treatment that lowered the markedly elevated pretreatment homocysteine level (from 337 to 72 and from 298 to 50 micromol/L) reduced the associated elevated EC-SOD in each by 50%. EC-SOD and methionine levels were unrelated (r=0.148, n=39, P=0.368). The positive relationship between circulating EC-SOD and homocysteine could represent a protective antioxidant response to homocysteine-induced oxidative damage and contribute to reducing cardiovascular risk in homocystinuric patients. EC-SOD levels may be relevant to the pathogenesis of vascular disease in other patient groups.

The positive correlation existing between hyperhomocyst(e)inemia [HH(e)] and vascular disease has firmly been established through data derived from numerous epidemiological and experimental observations. Clinical data corroborate that homocysteine (Hcy) is an independent risk factor for coronary, cerebral and peripheral arterial occlusive disease or peripheral venous thrombosis. Hcy is a sulfhydryl-containing amino acid that is formed by the demethylation of methionine. It is normally catalyzed to cystathionine by cystathionine beta-synthase a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme. Hcy is also remethylated to methionine by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-Hcy methyltransferase (methionine synthase), a vitamin B12 dependent enzyme and by betaine-Hcy methyltransferase. Nutritional status such as vitamin B12, or vitamin B6, or folate deficiencies and genetic defects such as cystathionine beta-synthase or methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase may contribute to increasing plasma homocysteine levels. The pathogenesis of Hcy-induced vascular damage may be multifactorial, including direct Hcy damage to the endothelium, stimulation of proliferation of smooth muscle cells, enhanced low-density lipoprotein peroxidation, increase of platelet aggregation, and effects on the coagulation system. Besides adverse effects on the endothelium and vessel wall, Hcy exert a toxic action on neuronal cells trough the stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Under these conditions, neuronal damage derives from excessive calcium influx and reactive oxygen generation. This mechanism may contribute to the cognitive changes and markedly increased risk of cerebrovascular disease in children and young adults with homocystunuria. Moreover, during stroke, in hiperhomocysteinemic patients, disruption of the blood-brain barrier results in exposure of the brain to near plasma levels of Hcy. The brain is exposed to 15-50 microM H(e). Thus, the neurotoxicity of Hcy acting through the overstimulation of NMDA receptors could contribute to neuronal damage in homocystinuria and HH(e). Since HH(e) is associated with certain neurodegeneratives diseases, in the present review, the molecular mechanisms involved in neurotoxicity due to Hcy are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Homocystinuria is a rare, congenital, autosomal-recessive, metabolic disease biochemically characterized by homocysteinemia and homocystinuria and by multi-system clinical disorders. It is a biochemical abnormality of methionine metabolism caused either by transulfuration pathway disorders or by disorders of homocysteine remethilation into methionine and as such it can be a result of numerous specific and different genetic lesions.CASE REPORT: Homocystinuria is most commonly caused by deficiency of cystationine beta synthetase enzyme which catalyses the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine in the methinione pathway. This results in accumulation of homocysteine and methionine in plasma and leads to excretion of excessive urinary homocysteine. Depending on specific property of the mutant enzyme molecule some patients respond to very high doses of pyridoxine with decreases of methionine and homocystine and some not. Pyridoxine responsiveness is based on the presence of small residual activity of cystathionine beta synthetase which is not present in nonresponsive patients. Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is characterized by numerous different clinical abnormalities, but changes in four organ systems are dominant (eye, skeletal, central nervous and vascular system).CASE DESCRIPTION: Six years ago a six year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with vision problems. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a lens dislocation and because of many stigmates the child was sent to endocrinologist. The child had a marfanoid stature, with pectus carinatum and genu valgum, ataxic gait with motoric discoordination, muscle tone which ranged from hypotonia to hypertonia of extrapvramidal type and low intellectual abilities. A simple cyanide-nitroprusside test of patient's urine was positive suggesting homocystinuria. The diagnosis was established after plasma and urine amino acid analysis by HPLC. Concentration of homocystine and methionine were 52 mumol/l and 57 mumol/l in plasma and 249 mumol/du and 55 mumol/du in urine, respectively. After four months of treatment with pyridoxine there were not any significant changes in plasma homocysteine and methionine, but at the same time decrease in urine of these two amino acids were more than 2.5 times higher. This confirms that the patient has a pyridoxine-responsive type of homocystinuria and the dose was increased to 60 mg/day and 600 mg/day. This results in further decline of homocysteine and methionine in plasma and urine which persists up to now (for six years).

Deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is the commonest cause of primary homocystinuria. Homocysteine metabolism is intimately linked with the metabolism of folate, vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and pyridoxine. It is hypothesised that the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric manifestations in homocystinuria, folate and cobalamin deficiencies are related to imbalance neurotransmitters in the CNS through disturbances in the pathways linking the metabolism of homocysteine and these vitamins. Although neuropsychiatric disorders are relatively common among patients with homocystinuria, it is not well recognised as the causative factor among patients presenting with neuropsychiatric disorders. A 31 year old woman presented with a three week history of delirium and inappropriate and labile affect. There was no history suggestive of drug or alcohol abuse, nutritional deficiency or organic disorders. EEG, cerebral CT, MRI and microbiological investigations did not reveal any organic causes. Because of a diagnosis of pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria seven years previously, the possibility of homocystinuria was considered and investigated. Laboratory tests revealed macrocytosis and a high concentration of urinary total homocystine. Commencement of pyridoxine at 400 mg/day resulted in disappearance of homocystine in urine within four days with remarkable clinical improvement. Homocystinuria should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained neuropsychiatric disorders in patients who have past or family history of homocystinuria, mental retardation, thromboembolic episodes, vascular diseases or clinical and laboratory features resembling folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiencies. Homocystinuria-associated neuropsychiatric disturbances can easily be treated with pyridoxine in 50% of cases.

Modest elevations of circulating homocysteine are common in patients with vascular disease. We explored interrelations between total plasma homocysteine levels and mutations in genes for three key enzymes in methionine-homocysteine metabolism. Methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C--&gt;T, cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) 68-bp insertion at exon 8, and methionine synthase (MS) 2756A--&gt;G were typed in 685 Australian caucasian patients aged &lt; or =65 years with and without angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD). We also assessed associations between homocysteine levels and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and other CAD risk factors. There were significant correlations between plasma total homocysteine, and EC-SOD (r = 0.170, p = 0.001 for men; r = 0.241, p = 0.003 for women) and LDL (r = 0.153, p = 0.001 for men; r = 0.132, p = 0.081 for women). Levels were also significantly higher among patients with unstable angina (15.30+/-0.44 micromol/l for men, 14.44+/-0.74 micromol/l for women) than those without angina (13.98+/-0.38 micromol/l for men, 13.41+/-0.98 micromol/l for women) or with stable angina (14.00+/-0.37 micromol/l for men, 12.88+/-0.71 micromol/l for women). There were no significant associations between the levels and the presence or severity of CAD. The mutant MTHFR homozygotes tended to have higher levels and those with the MS and CBS mutations tended to have lower levels. We conclude that there is a significant correlation between plasma homocysteine levels and EC-SOD suggesting that elevated homocysteine may exert oxidative stress and that levels are associated with unstable angina, but not the occurrence or extent of coronary stenosis. The contributions to total plasma homocysteine levels of the common mutations of genes coding for the enzymes controlling homocysteine metabolism are modest.

We have determined the activity and protein levels of CBS in a number of cardiovascular cells and tissues by direct enzyme assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. We have also determined the activity of BHMT in these same tissues and cells and have come to the conclusion that neither enzyme is expressed. This results suggests that in the human cardiovascular system homocysteine metabolism is limited to the remethylation pathway catalyzed by MS. Thus, hyperhomocysteinemia in conjunction with a limited metabolic capacity for homocysteine in the cardiovascular system could result in cellular dysfunction.

Homocysteine is a sulfur amino acid whose metabolism stands at the intersection of two pathways: remethylation to methionine, which requires folate and vitamin B12 (or betaine in an alternative reaction); and transsulfuration to cystathionine, which requires pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. The two pathways are coordinated by S-adenosylmethionine, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase reaction and as an activator of cystathionine beta-synthase. Hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition that recent epidemiological studies have shown to be associated with increased risk of vascular disease, arises from disrupted homocysteine metabolism. Severe hyperhomocysteinemia is due to rare genetic defects resulting in deficiencies in cystathionine beta synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, or in enzymes involved in methyl-B12 synthesis and homocysteine methylation. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia seen in fasting conditions is due to mild impairment in the methylation pathway (i.e. folate or B12 deficiencies or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase thermolability). Post-methionine-load hyperhomocysteinemia may be due to heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase defect or B6 deficiency. Early studies with nonphysiological high homocysteine levels showed a variety of deleterious effects on endothelial or smooth muscle cells in culture. More recent studies with human beings and animals with mild hyperhomocysteinemia provided encouraging results in the attempt to understand the mechanism that underlies this relationship between mild elevations of plasma homocysteine and vascular disease. The studies with animal models indicated the possibility that the effect of elevated homocysteine is multifactorial, affecting both the vascular wall structure and the blood coagulation system.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, is the most prevalent inborn error of methionine metabolism. Its diverse clinical expression may include ectopia lentis, skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation, and premature arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. This variability is likely caused by considerable genetic heterogeneity. We investigated the molecular basis of CBS deficiency in 29 Dutch patients from 21 unrelated pedigrees and studied the possibility of a genotype-phenotype relationship with regard to biochemical and clinical expression and response to homocysteine-lowering treatment. Clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters were recorded at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Of 10 different mutations detected in the CBS gene, 833T--&gt;C (I278T) was predominant, present in 23 (55%) of 42 independent alleles. At diagnosis, homozygotes for this mutation (n=12) tended to have higher homocysteine levels than those seen in patients with other genotypes (n=17), but similar clinical manifestations. During follow-up, I278T homozygotes responded more efficiently to homocysteine-lowering treatment. After 378 patient-years of treatment, only 2 vascular events were recorded; without treatment, at least 30 would have been expected (P&lt;.01). This intervention in Dutch patients significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and other sequelae of classical homocystinuria syndrome.

Thrombotic and thromboembolic complications are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with homocystinuria. However, it is unusual for thrombosis and infarction to be the presenting feature leading to investigation for homocystinuria and cerebrovascular lesions in the first year of life. We describe a previously healthy 6-month-old infant who presented with a large middle-cerebral-artery territory infarction and died of massive brain swelling. Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency was diagnosed by metabolite analysis and confirmed by enzymatic activity measurement in a postmortem liver biopsy. Homocystinuria should be considered in the differential diagnosis of venous or arterial thrombosis, regardless of age, even in the absence of other common features of the disease. We recommend systematic metabolic screening for hyperhomocysteinemia in any child presenting with vascular lesions or premature thromboembolism.

High plasma levels of homocysteine are the results of the interplay between congenital and environmental factors. In the last two decades, a growing amount of interest has focused on mild-to-moderate hyperhomocysteinemia as a risk factor of thromboembolic diseases. Case-control and cross-sectional studies clearly indicated that mild-to-moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with heightened risk of both arterial and venous thrombosis. On the other hand, prospective studies did not unequivocally show that hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a high thrombotic risk. Therefore, additional studies are needed to define whether hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for thrombosis, especially of the venous circulation. Among these, prospective cohort studies will clarify better the temporal relationship between high homocysteine levels and the thrombotic event. Most importantly, however, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of the effects of homocysteine-lowering vitamins on the thrombotic risk are urgently needed. Not only will they help in defining whether the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and thrombosis is causal, they will also have a potential dramatic impact in the prevention of thromboembolic events.

The sulfur-containing amino acid, homocysteine, is formed from the essential amino acid methionine, and a number of B vitamins are involved in methionine metabolism. Pyridoxine, vitamin B6, is a cofactor for cystathionine beta synthase, which mediates the transformation of homocysteine to cystathionine, the initial step in the transsulfuration pathway and the urinary excretion of sulfur. In a normal diet there is conservation of the carbon skeleton, and about 50% of the homocysteine formed is remethylated to methionine via steps that require folic acid and vitamin B12. A deficiency of any of these three vitamins leads to modest homocyst(e)ine elevation, as does diminished renal function, both of which are common in the elderly. It is also established that homocyst(e)ine elevation of this order is associated with increased cardiovascular risk but is also associated with most established risk factors, although it is thought to be an independent contributor. In the inborn error of metabolism homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency there is greatly increased circulating homocyst(e)ine and a clear association with precocious vascular disease. In about 50% of these patients there is a vascular event before the age of 30 years. The homocysteine-induced adverse vascular changes appear to result from endothelial and smooth muscle cell effects and increased thrombogenesis. We have documented a highly significant reduction in the occurrence of vascular events during 539 patient years of treatment in 32 patients with cystathionine beta synthase deficiency (mean age 30 years, range 9-66 years) by aggressive homocyst(e)ine lowering with pyridoxine, folic acid, and B12 (p = 0.0001). The 15 pyridoxine nonresponsive patients also received oral betaine. Although a cause and effect relationship is postulated for the increased cardiovascular risk associated with mild homocysteine elevation, a common cause of this elevation is the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. Homozygotes occur in about 11% of Caucasian populations. However, the mutation is not associated with increased coronary risk. Since mild homocysteine elevation is easily normalized by B vitamin supplementation, usually with folic acid, it remains for controlled clinical trials of this inexpensive therapy to determine whether normalizing mild homocyst(e)ine elevation reduces cardiovascular risk.

The possibility that modest elevations in the level of blood homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinaemia) could contribute to cardiovascular disease arose from investigation of patients with rare, severe homocysteine elevations caused by cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Such patients often had thromboembolic events before the age of 30 years. Since the established cardiovascular risk factors could only partly account for the occurrence and severity of vascular disease in the general population, other risk factors had to exist, and homocysteine elevation seemed to be a possible candidate. Australian case-control studies identified an association between mild homocysteine elevation and early-onset coronary disease, and also with chronic renal failure. Patients in the latter group have a high prevalence of unexplained vascular disease and particularly high homocysteine levels. Such elevations in levels of homocysteine in vascular patients could usually be normalised by daily supplementation with folic acid (1-5 mg) while in patients with chronic renal failure 5 mg of folic acid daily markedly reduced the increased concentrations of homocysteine. These initial observations have been confirmed by many investigators and biologically plausible mechanisms for homocysteine-induced vascular dysfunction, and particularly endothelial dysfunction, have been identified. However, associations between hyperhomocysteinaemia and other risk factors, such as smoking and hypertension, have also been documented and need to be controlled for when assessing any increase in risk that homocysteine may independently confer. Although it has been established that lowering the greatly elevated blood homocysteine levels in homocystinuria, due to cystathione beta-synthase deficiency, unquestionably reduces cardiovascular risk, it remains to be determined whether normalising mild homocysteine elevation could reduce cardiovascular risk. Trials to test this possibility have been initiated and others are planned.

Recent developments in ultrasound technology enable the noninvasive measurement of structural and functional vessel wall changes. Until now, the effect of homocysteine on the arterial wall has remained unclear: reports on intima-media thickness (IMT) yield conflicting results, whereas data on vessel wall stiffness are lacking. Because several cardiovascular risk factors result in an increased IMT or stiffness, different groups at risk for atherosclerotic disease, with special emphasis on hyperhomocysteinemia, were studied. Nineteen patients homozygous and 14 subjects heterozygous for cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, 21 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), 15 patients with essential hypertension, 20 smokers, and 28 control subjects were studied. The IMT values (both right and left) of the common carotid artery (CCA), bulb (BUL), internal carotid artery (ICA), and common femoral artery (CFA) were measured in millimeters by high-resolution ultrasound (Biosound). The distensibility (DC, in 10(-3). kPa-1) and compliance (CC in mm2. kPa-1) coefficients of the CCA (right and left) and CFA (right) were determined by a wall track system (Pie Medical). The mean IMT of the posterior wall in the CCA was 0.70+/-0.09 mm in healthy controls. For patients with vascular disease, FH, and hypertension and in smokers, the mean CCA IMT was larger, whereas no major differences in IMT were observed in patients either homozygous or heterozygous for CBS deficiency. The DC and CC in the right CCA were 23.5+/-6.9 (10(-3). kPa-1) and 0.9+/-0.3 (mm2. kPa-1) in healthy subjects, slightly lower in patients homozygous for CBS deficiency, and clearly lower in patients with vascular disease, FH, and hypertension. No positive correlation was found between plasma homocysteine level and either IMT, CC, or DC. Because smoking was a confounder in each risk group, a stepwise regression analysis was carried out to assess the contribution of each risk factor on IMT and arterial wall stiffness. Age explained most of the variation in IMT of the CCA (coefficient of determination R2 of 0.34), whereas R2 values for serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking (pack-years), and systolic blood pressure were 0.08, 0.07, and 0.06, respectively. Homocysteine did not contribute to variation in IMT in both the CCA and CFA. Age and smoking contributed to the variation in IMT in the CFA. The variation in DC and CC in the right CCA and right CFA could in part be explained by age, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure. Plasma homocysteine concentration explained only a small proportion of the variation in DC in the CCA (R2=0.02) and in CC in the CFA (R2=0.04). In this study, no relationship was found between homocysteine level and the thickness of the arterial wall, with only a marginal influence on stiffness.

An elevation in the concentration of total plasma homocysteine is known to be an independent risk factor for the development of vascular disease. Alterations in homocysteine metabolism have also been observed clinically in diabetic patients. Patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have signs of renal dysfunction tend to exhibit elevated total plasma homocysteine levels, whereas type 1 diabetic patients who have no clinical signs of renal dysfunction have lower than normal plasma homocysteine levels. The purpose of this study was to investigate homocysteine metabolism in a type 1 diabetic animal model and to examine whether insulin plays a role in its regulation. Diabetes was induced by intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg streptozotocin to Sprague-Dawley rats. We observed a 30% reduction in plasma homocysteine in the untreated diabetic rat. This decrease in homocysteine was prevented when diabetic rats received insulin. Transsulfuration and remethylation enzymes were measured in both the liver and the kidney. We observed an increase in the activities of the hepatic transsulfuration enzymes (cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase) in the untreated diabetic rat. Insulin treatment normalized the activities of these enzymes. The renal activities of these enzymes were unchanged. These results suggest that insulin is involved in the regulation of plasma homocysteine concentrations by affecting the hepatic transsulfuration pathway, which is involved in the catabolism of homocysteine.

The objectives were firstly to assess the evidence that homocysteine is a significant and independent risk factor for vascular disease with special reference to cardiovascular disease, and secondly to evaluate the evidence that a food staple fortified with folic acid will reduce this problem on a population basis. The structure of plasma homocysteine (tHcy) is described. Homocysteine, a highly reactive compound, is synthesized from the amino acid, methionine, and is metabolized by two pathways, the catabolic transsulphuration route via cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) and the remethylation path using 5-methyltetrahy-drofolate polyglutamate, the product of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; EC 1.1.1.171), via the cobalamin dependent enzyme, methionine synthase (MS; EC 2.1.1.13).The mechanisms whereby hyper-tHcy is produced include both increased rates of synthesis and decreased metabolism. The latter may occur owing to nutritional deficiency of the vitamin cofactors which are necessary for the normal function of the metabolic enzymes. In particular, folate is required for methylene reductase, pyridoxal phosphate for cystathionine synthase and cobalamin for methionine synthase. When these vitamins are deficient hyper-tHcy is induced and this occurs especially in the elderly. Alternatively, a variant form of methylene reductase has recently been described which occurs in nearly 10% of the normal population. This variant is associated with hyper-tHcy, especially in situations associated with a low folate nutritional status. Meta-analysis of both retrospective case-control studies, nested prospective case-control surveys and a secondary trial of mortality in postmyocardial infarct patients have shown that the association of hyper-tHcy with vascular disease is beyond doubt. This has been further supported by direct assessments of the degree of vascular disease in the carotid brachial and aortic arteries in relation to tHcy levels. Furthermore, treatment with a cocktail of the vitamin cofactors has produced lowering of tHcy levels and regression of the vascular disease in the carotid arteries of affected individuals. Suggested pathogenic mechanisms in vascular disease induced by hyper-tHcy include vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, smooth muscle proliferation and derangements of normal intravascular regulation mechanisms. A variety of clinical conditions are known to be associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic complications. Some of these are associated with hyper-tHcy. Low physiological doses of folic acid, as well as pharmocological doses, lower tHcy. However, because of the poor bioavailability of food folate (50%) and the considerable chemical instability of the naturally occurring reduced forms of folate, in most people it would require unacceptably high consumption of green vegetables to accomplish the necessary increase in intracellular folate and reduction in tHcy. Accordingly, folic acid, the nonreduced synthetic form of the vitamin, which is 100% bioavailable and chemically extremely stable, should be added to a food staple such as flour to ensure maximum protection for most of the population.

In order to determine if cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) could separate groups of patients with various vascular disease, CBS activity was studied in cultured human skin fibroblasts from 30 subjects being either controls, atherosclerotic patients or patients having suffered a deep venous thrombosis. We found a tendency to a negative correlation between age and CBS activity in the control group only (r = -0.58, P = 0.08), with a tendency to lower CBS activities in the young patients with atherosclerotic (4.9) or venous disease (5.3) compared to the young control group (10.2). This could implicate higher levels of p-homocysteine with increased age as well as in young patients with atherosclerotic or thrombotic disease causing vascular damage. The results are important for the further discussion of the role of homocysteine as a risk factor for developing atherosclerotic and thrombogenic vascular disease and for finding a suitable screening method as prevention is by vitamin supplement only.

Homocysteine is a metabolite of methionine that may be remethylated by enzymes requiring folate and cobalamin (vitamin B12) to again form methionine or catabolized by the pyridoxine (vitamin B6) dependent enzyme, cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) to form cysteine (fig. 1) [1]. Homocysteine exists as a combination of various free and protein bound forms, but the total amount is what is usually measured and may be reported as homocyst(e)ine [2]. The biological plausibility that elevated homocysteine might lead to vascular disease noted in 1969 by McCully [3]. He reported that a child with abnormal cobalamin metabolism and hyperhomocysteinemia had arterial lesions similar to those seen in children with severe hyperhomocysteinemia from CBS deficiency. These findings led to the idea that moderate elevations in homocysteine, even those still within the so-called normal range, might also lead to vascular pathology through a variety of mechanisms including atherosclerosis and thrombosis [4].

The thiol amino acid homocysteine (HC) accumulates in homocystinuria and homocyst(e)inemia, and is associated with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. To determine whether HC influences the cell's program of gene expression, vascular endothelial cells were treated with HC for 6-42 h and analyzed by differential display. We found a 3-7-fold, time-dependent induction of a 220-base pair fragment, which demonstrated complete sequence identity with elongation factor-1delta (EF-1delta), a member of the multimeric complex regulating mRNA translation. Fibroblasts from cystathionine beta-synthase -/- individuals also showed up to 3.0-fold increased levels of mRNA for EF-1alpha, -beta, and -delta when compared with normal cells, and treatment of normal cells with the HC precursor, methionine, induced a 1.5-2.0-fold increase in EF-1alpha, -beta, and -delta mRNA. This induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide and reflected a doubling in the rate of gene transcription in nuclear run-on analyses. In HC-treated endothelial cells, pulse-chase studies revealed a doubling in the rate of synthesis of the thiol-containing protein, annexin II, but no change in synthesis of the cysteineless protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Thus, HC induces expression of a family of acute translational response genes through a protein synthesis-dependent transcriptional mechanism. This process may mediate accelerated synthesis of free thiol-containing proteins in response to HC-induced oxidative stress.

Mutations in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) are known to cause homocystinuria, a recessive disorder characterized by excessive levels of total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma. The primary cause of mortality is thromboembolism induced by the excessive tHcy levels. Mild increases in tHcy levels are a significant risk factor in the development of vascular disease in the general population. This can result from heterozygosity at the CBS locus or polymorphic variation in other enzymes involved in homocysteine re-methylation. We report here that a mutation which deletes the carboxy-terminal 145 amino acids of CBS can functionally suppress the phenotype of several CBS mutant alleles found in homocystinurics when expressed in yeast. This C-terminal domain of CBS acts to inhibit enzymatic activity and is in turn regulated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a positive effector of CBS. Our results indicate that most mutations found in homocystinurics do not cause dysfunction of the catalytic domain, but rather interfere with the activation of the enzyme. These findings suggest a new drug target to treat homocystinuria and homocysteine-related vascular disease.

Moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia (MHH) is a risk factor for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. About 10%-20% of the normal population have homocysteine levels contributing to an increased risk for arterial and venous disease. Main regulating enzymes of homocysteine metabolism are cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Heterozygosity for CBS deficiency is most likely not an important cause for MHH in vascular disease. A recently discovered cause of MHH is reduced MTHFR activity due to a homozygous C677T mutation in the coding region of MTHFR. This mutation has been related to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, although a number of studies are not confirmative. The elevated homocysteine levels due to this mutation can be normalized by administration of vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism, in particular folate.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease of sulphur amino acid metabolism. Major clinical manifestations include disorders of the eye, the skeleton, the central nervous system and the vascular system. A wide clinical spectrum of the disease has been reported. We discuss the role of genetic factors (e.g. different mutations of the CBS gene and a variable genetic background) and the importance of environmental factors (e.g. diet, vitamins, perinatal factors and drugs) in explaining the phenotypic variability observed in homocystinuria.</AbstractText>: Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease of sulphur amino acid metabolism.

The mechanism by which homocysteine causes endothelial cell (EC) injury and/or dysfunction is not fully understood. To examine the stress-inducing effects of homocysteine on ECs, mRNA differential display and cDNA microarrays were used to evaluate changes in gene expression in cultured human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to homocysteine. Here we show that homocysteine increases the expression of GRP78 and GADD153, stress-response genes induced by agents or conditions that adversely affect the function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Induction of GRP78 was specific for homocysteine because other thiol-containing amino acids, heat shock or H2O2 did not appreciably increase GRP78 mRNA levels. Homocysteine failed to elicit an oxidative stress response in HUVEC because it had no effect on the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) including HSP70, nor did it activate heat shock transcription factor 1. Furthermore homocysteine blocked the H2O2-induced expression of HSP70. In support of our findings in vitro, steady-state mRNA levels of GRP78, but not HSP70, were elevated in the livers of cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice with hyperhomocysteinaemia. These studies indicate that the activation of stress response genes by homocysteine involves reductive stress leading to altered ER function and is in contrast with that of most other EC perturbants. The observation that homocysteine also decreases the expression of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and natural killer-enhancing factor B suggests that homocysteine could potentially enhance the cytotoxic effect of agents or conditions known to cause oxidative stress.

Elevated total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) is recognized as an independent risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. However, it is not known how much of the observed hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with vascular disease is due to heterozygosity for cystathionine-beta-synthase (CbetaS) deficiency, because a clinically useful screening method is unavailable. To determine this, parents of children who are homozygous for CbetaS deficiency (affected with homocystinuria) and a control population were compared for tHcy, total plasma cysteine (tCys), plasma folate, and plasma vitamin B12. The group of obligate heterozygotes had increased tHcy (P &lt; or = .01), decreased tCys (P &lt; or = .01), and decreased plasma folate (P &lt; or = .01). The calculated ratios of tHcy/tCys (P = .01) and tHcy/plasma folate (P = .003) were the best metabolic discriminants for genotype. These ratios are likely to prove useful in heterozygote screening for CPS deficiency and in the development of rational treatment strategies for patients with increased tHcy.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CS) deficiency is the most common inborn error of methionine metabolism. Patients with CS-deficiency have an extremely high risk of vascular disease. The underlying mechanism is still unsolved. Dysfunction of endothelial cells could be the trigger in the formation of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Therefore, differences in cell function were studied between normal and CS-deficient human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in culture media as a measure of homocysteine export increased in all cell lines, including the cell line with CS-deficiency, with constant amounts of approximately 2.5 microM every 24 h. von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in culture media were used as markers of endothelial function and increased also with progression of culture time. The effects of additions of folate, vitamin B6 and methionine to the culture medium were studied. The homocysteine export and the markers of endothelial function did not differ between the control and the CS-deficient HUVECs under various test conditions. These data show that CS-deficient endothelial cells have normal homocysteine export and normal endothelial cell function. In CS-deficient patients the very high blood levels of homocysteine, probably due to deficient CS function in liver and kidney, seems to be the hazardous factor to endothelial cells, thus promoting atherosclerosis and thrombosis in CS-deficient patients.

Background: The continued identfication of new mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene is important in correlating the genotype/phenotype of patients with classic homocystinuria and in assessing whether heterozygosity of CBS deficiency is an important cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia, an independent risk factor for occlusive vascular diseases. Methods and Results: Single-strand polymorphism and direct nucleotide sequencing were used to detect two novel mutations in the CBS gene of three homocystinuric patients from two unrelated families. The first mutation, a G-to-A transistion at nucleotide 1316 in exon 12, results in an amino acid substitution of arginine by glutamine at codon 439. The second mutation is a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1109 in exon 10 and results in an amino acid substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at codon 370. All three patients are apparently compound heterozygotes, with one of the two novel mutations on one allele and the T(833)C mutation on the other allele. Conclusions: The absence of the G(1316)A and G(1109)A in 216 control alleles demonstrates that these two novel mutations do not represent common polymorphisms, but rather are responsible for the defective CBS enzyme activities encoded by one of the two alleles of the CBS gene in each of the two families.

The high incidence of vascular complications in severe hyperhomocysteinaemia in homozygotes for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency has focused attention upon homocysteine as an atherogenic and thrombophilic agent. For two decades there has been accumulating evidence of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia as risk factor of vascular disease. Pooled data on hundreds of coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease patients show that mild hyperhomocysteinaemia was detectable in about 20-30%. In a recent meta-analysis of 27 studies up to 1994, including about 4000 patients and as many controls, it is calculated that the summary odds ratio of elevated homocysteine levels was 1.7, with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-1.9, for coronary heart disease; it was 2.5, with 95% CI 2.0-3.0, for cerebro-vascular disease; and it was 6.8, with 95% CI 2.9-15.8, for peripheral vascular disease. The relevance of this newly recognized risk factor will be demonstrated by the outcome of the European Comac study on 'Hyperhomocysteinaemia and Vascular Disease', a multicentre case-control study on 800 vascular patients and 750 controls. Despite the selection for epidemiological reasons of a relatively low cut-off level as the criterion for mild hyperhomocysteinaemia in this study-the upper 20% of the distribution of control levels-the relative risk of thus-defined hyperhomocysteinaemia for arterial disease is about 2. This equals the relative risk of hypercholesterolaemia and of smoking; hypertension leads to a higher excess risk. The observed synergistic interaction between hyperhomocysteinaemia and hypertension and smoking may warrant a change in the now generally followed procedure of screening for hyperhomocysteinaemia only if conventional risk factors have not been detected in the patient. Those vascular patients with combined risk factors leading to synergism in their joint effect may profit most from homocysteinelowering intervention.

Among 40 patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency diagnosed in the state of New South Wales, Australia (population 6 million) and followed long-term, there were 10 deaths at ages 2-30 years. Of these 8 were definite vascular deaths, one was a presumed vascular death, and the other was due to an accident and unrelated to homocystinuria. The vascular deaths were all early cases and only one patient, a pyridoxine-responsive 30-year-old woman, had been prescribed adequate treatment although it was uncertain that she was taking it. In 32 patients of mean age 30 years (range 9-66 years) there were 539 patient-years of treatment with pyridoxine, folic acid and hydroxocobalamin. There were 17 pyridoxine-responsive patients and all maintained plasma total free homocyst(e)ine levels &lt; 20 mumol/L over an average treatment period of 16.6 years. The 15 nonresponsive patients received additionally 6-9 g of betaine daily. This resulted in a further 74% mean decline (+/-14% SD) in plasma total free homocyst(e)ine, persisting during an average (post-betaine) treatment period of 11 years; current mean +/- SD levels are 33 +/- 17 mumol/L (n = 15). There were two vascular events during treatment, one fatal pulmonary embolus (see above) and one myocardial infarction, whereas without treatment, 21 would have been expected, chi2 = 14.22, p = 0.0001, relative risk 0.09 (95% CI 0.02-0.38). There were no events during 258 patient-years of treatment in the 15 pyridoxine-nonresponsive patients (p &lt; 0.005 versus expected untreated). Nineteen patients had a total of 19 major and 15 minor operations requiring anaesthetic, and three had successful pregnancies, one whilst receiving betaine. There were no thromboembolic complications. We conclude that treatment which effectively lowers circulating homocyst(e)ine, even to suboptimal levels, markedly reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, and that betaine therapy contributes importantly to this in pyridoxine-nonresponsive patients. Betaine as additional therapy is safe and effective for at least 16 years.

Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by homocystinuria and multisystemic clinical disorders. The term denotes a biochemical abnormality of methionine metabolism caused both by transsulfuration pathway disorders and remethylation of homocysteine into methionine, and as such it can be a result of numerous specific and different genetic lesions. Homocystinuria is most commonly caused by deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) activity (EC 4.2.1.22). In this lesion, depending on specific characteristics of mutant enzyme molecules, in regard to existence of residual activity, responsive and nonresponsive homocystinuria can be differed regarding clinical response to high doses of pyridoxine. Although there are numerous different clinical abnormalities, changes on four organ systems are dominant. The most common symptoms of homocystinuria include lens dislocation, vascular disorders, skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. Laboratory findings are the first diagnostic procedure, while determination of enzymatic activity is a direct parameter for making diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis and early detection are extremely important for the course and prognosis of the disease as they enable application of currently available therapy as soon as possible. The presently available therapy can, only in such cases, prevent occurrence of serious clinical symptoms, prevent their advancement to some extent or improve reversible clinical manifestations.

The link between vascular disease and elevated homocysteine levels has been recognized for more than 30 years, and association with moderately elevated levels has been suspected for 20 years. Homocysteine is a sulfhydryl-containing amino acid that is formed by the demethylation of methionine. It is normally catalysed to cystathionine by cystathionine beta-synthase a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme. Homocysteine is also remethylated to methionine by methionine synthase, a vitamin B12 dependent enzyme and by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Environmental factors such as folate, or vitamin B12, or vitamin B6 deficiencies and genetic defects such as cystathionine beta-synthase or abnormality of methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase or some vitamin B12 metabolism defects may contribute to increasing plasma homocysteine levels. Normal fasting levels of homocysteine lie within the range 6-16 mumol/l. Apart from differences in assay methods, age, sex and nutritional status may affect the plasma levels. Though it is now well known that homocysteine is an independent risk factor for premature vascular disease, the pathogenesis of homocysteine-induced vascular damage is, for the most part, unknown. It may be multifactorial, including direct homocysteine damage to the endothelium, an enhanced low-density lipoprotein peroxidation, an increase of platelet thromboxane A2, or a decrease of protein C activation.

Editing of the non-protein amino acid homocysteine, a frequent type of error-correcting process in amino acid selection for protein synthesis by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, results in formation of a cyclic thioester, homocysteine thiolactone. Here it is shown that human cells in which homocysteine metabolism is deregulated by a mutation in the cystathionine beta-synthase gene and/or by an antifolate drug, aminopterin (which prevents remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by methionine synthase), produce more homocysteine thiolactone, in addition to homocysteine, than unaffected cells. The thiolactone is incorporated into cellular and extracellular proteins, in addition to being secreted and hydrolyzed to homocysteine. Experiments with model proteins and amino acids suggest that the mechanism of incorporation involves acylation of side chain amino groups of lysine residues by the activated carboxyl group of the thiolactone. The metabolic conversion of homocysteine to homocysteine thiolactone and the reactivity of the thiolactone toward proteins may explain pathological consequences of elevated levels of homocysteine such as observed in vascular disease.

We have investigated the disposition of potentially endotoxic homocysteine (Hcy) and its transsulfuration metabolite cysteine (Cys) in 98 individuals (age range 20-66 years). Our study reports on the relationship between Hcy and two important dietary factors likely to influence plasma levels of this thiol: dietary folate and dietary methionine. chi2 analysis shows a low frequency of elevated plasma Hcy at high folate intake. This frequency for Hcy &gt;10 micromol/liter with a folate intake &gt;350 microg/day is significant (P &lt; 0.02). The data reflect a tendency for elevated Hcy values to be associated with low dietary folate, although many subjects with a low dietary folate also had a low plasma Hcy. Intake of dietary methionine was found to be significantly higher in males than in females (P &lt; .0001). This may account for the looser relationship between Hcy and its transsulfuration product, Cys, in females (R2 = 0.30) compared to males (R2 = 0.73), since conversion of methionine to SAM in males would activate cystathionine beta synthase and commit excess Hcy to transsulfuration. The generally lower methionine intake of females means that more Hcy is utilized in the remethylation cycle in which methionine is produced from the de novo methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or from the preformed methyl group of betaine. Clearly a Hcy moiety locked up in remethylation would be further removed from Cys, the end product of transsulfuration. An increasing number of studies are clarifying the relationship between Hcy, folate, and other B vitamins. However, less attention seems to be given to the influence of dietary methionine on the disposition of Hcy. The present study supports biochemical theory and indicates that more focus should be given to the effect of dietary methionine on Hcy. These findings have particular significance since even moderate increases in plasma Hcy are associated with a toxic vascular effect. Consequently the relationship between dietary folate and Hcy levels should be a factor in evaluating recommended dietary allowances for this vitamin. The simplicity of our dietary folate questionnaire also raises the possibility of a screening test in which individuals can ascertain whether their folate intake is adequate to reduce Hcy levels to a benign value.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the causes for delay in the diagnosis of homocystinuria.DESIGN: Clinical and laboratory data were collected from patients diagnosed as having homocystinuria due to cystathionine synthase deficiency, with special reference to the ages at which the patients had their first major signs of the disease, ectopia lentis was established, and homocystinuria was diagnosed.SETTING: University hospital in the Netherlands.SUBJECTS: 34 patients (18 males) in whom homocystinuria due to cystathionine synthase deficiency was diagnosed in the period 1970-94.RESULTS: Among 34 consecutively detected homocystinuria patients the mean age at diagnosis of homocystinuria was 24 (range 1-61) years. Despite frequent ocular manifestations, serious complications in the vascular, skeletal, and central nervous systems, and repeated examinations performed in these patients by clinicians of various disciplines, there was a mean delay of 11 (0-43) years between the first major signs of the disease (at mean age 13 (1-40) years) and the ultimate diagnosis of homocystinuria. Even when ectopia lentis was diagnosed (in 26 (76%) patients, mean age 18 (1-50) years), this did not lead to adequate biochemical analysis for homocystinuria at the time of detection, causing a mean diagnostic delay of 8 (0-24) years in these patients.CONCLUSIONS: Three factors should have precipitated the diagnosis of homocystinuria: early recognition that unusual myopia (high, very high, abnormal progressive, or at young age) was caused by subluxation of the ocular lenses; awareness that the occurrence of myopia combined with systemic complications (&quot;myopia plus&quot;) might be due to homocystinuria; and appropriate biochemical investigations carried out in patients with ectopia lentis and in their siblings.

OBJECTIVE: We used single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) to screen for mutations at nucleotides 833 and 919 of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene in 13 patients with homocystinuria and 11 of their relatives.METHODS: Exon 8 of genomic DNA was selectively amplified by PCR using primers derived from intronic sequences of the human CBS gene. SSCP analysis was performed on the amplified products. Genotypes identified by SSCP were confirmed by DNA sequencing and an allele-specific PCR method.RESULTS: SSCP identified 5 patterns corresponding to five genotypes. We confirmed that the different genotypes result from mutations at nucleotides 833 and 919 of the CBS gene, and that these 2 mutations account for approximately 50% of affected alleles in homocystinuria patients.CONCLUSION: Our recent elucidation of intron-exon borders and intronic sequences of the CBS gene has made possible the use of SSCP to screen for known/unknown mutations in the CBS gene. Because T833C and G919A represent the two most common mutations and both are located within exon 8 of the CBS gene, SSCP of exon 8 allows screening of the heterozygous carrier state of these mutations in a large population, to determine the importance of heterozygosity of CBS mutations as the cause of mild hyperhomocyst(e)inemia associated with premature vascular diseases.

Mild hyperhomocysteinaemia is a major risk factor for vascular disease and neural tube defects (NTDs), conferring an approximately three-fold relative risk for each condition. It has several possible causes: heterozygosity for rare loss of function mutations in the genes for 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) or cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS); dietary insufficiency of vitamin co-factors B6, B12 or folates; or homozygosity for a common 'thermolabile' mutation in the MTHFR gene which has also been associated with vascular disease and NTDs. We quantified the contribution of the thermolabile mutation to the hyperhomocysteinaemic phenotype in a working male population (625 individuals). Serum folate and vitamin B12 concentrations were also measured and their relationship with homocysteine status and MTHFR genotype assessed. The homozygous thermolabile genotype occurred in 48.4, 35.5, and 23.4% of the top 5, 10, and 20% of individuals (respectively) ranked by plasma homocysteine levels, compared with a frequency of 11.5% in the study population as a whole, establishing that the mutation is a major determinant of homocysteine levels at the upper end of the range. Serum folate concentrations also varied with genotype, being lowest in thermolabile homozygotes. The MTHFR thermolabile genotype should be considered when population studies are designed to determine the effective homocysteine-lowering dose of dietary folate supplements, and when prophylactic doses of folate are recommended for individuals.

Two separate metabolic pathways that methylate homocysteine to methionine are known in humans, utilizing, respectively, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and betaine as methyl donors. Deficiency of the folate-dependent methylation system is linked to hyperhomocysteinemia. Our data suggest that this deficiency leads to concurrent metabolic down-regulation of homocysteine transsulfuration that may contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia. By contrast, no instances have been reported of hyperhomocysteinemia resulting from deficiencies of betaine-dependent homocysteine methylation. Long-term betaine supplementation of 10 patients, who had pyridoxine-resistant homocystinuria and gross hyperhomocysteinemia due to deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase activity, caused a substantial lowering of plasma homocysteine, which has now been maintained for periods of up to 13 years. Betaine had to be taken regularly because the effect soon disappeared when treatment was stopped. In conclusion, depressed activity of the transsulfuration pathway may contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia because of primary deficiencies of enzymes of either the transsulfuration or of the folate-dependent methylation pathways. Stimulation of betaine-dependent homocysteine remethylation causes a commensurate decrease in plasma homocysteine that can be maintained as long as betaine is taken.

To assess the risk for homocyst(e)ine-associated vascular disease, overt hyperhomocyst(e)inemia should be demonstrated. In nonhomocystinuric subjects, clinical vascular disease must have developed after 40 or more years of persistent hyperhomocyst(e)inemia which may not be present without a genetic defect(s). Nongenetic factors, however, may amplify or mask phenotypic expression of a genetic defect, causing difficulties for the evaluation of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia based on plasma homocyst(e)ine concentration alone. Therefore, the search for genetic defects seems as important as the determination of plasma homocyst(e)ine concentration in evaluating the relationship between hyperhomocyst(e)inemia and the development of vascular disease. If genetic defect, such as heterozygous cystathionine synthase deficiency or thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is not detected, post-methionine homocyst(e)ine determination is a suitable means to identify genetic susceptibility to hyperhomocyst(e)inemia when the environmental factors are similar in the control and study groups.

Fasting and post-methionine load plasma total homocysteine concentrations were investigated in the parents of two homocystinuric patients. Three genetic mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase gene were found. In the patient of family 1, a frequent Caucasian mutation. T833C, was found on one allele, while the mutation on the other allele has not yet been defined. In the patient of family 2, a mutation C569T, recently described by Sperandeo and colleagues, was found on one allele, while a novel mutation, G346A, was characterized on the other allele. The frequent gene mutation T833C was detected in a heterozygous mother who, surprisingly, exhibited strictly normal fasting and post-methionine load homocysteinaemia. In contrast, in the other family, we found a novel mutation (G346A) in the mother located near Lys 119, the putative binding site of phosphopyridoxal phosphate. This mother exhibited increased fasting and post-methionine load homocysteinaemia. These observations could explain the conflicting results reported for vascular pathologies in parents of homocystinuric patients and direct the search for genetic mutations in these vascular pathologies.

BACKGROUND: Homocysteinaemia is now accepted as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Our goal was to study the influence of age plasma homocysteine level on the CAD risk attributable to homocysteinaemia.METHODS: We studied a group of 98 patients under 55 years of age who had suffered a myocardial infarction 3-12 months before the study. The patients were matched by sex and age with a group of 98 controls without vascular disease. We measured the plasma homocysteine levels 6h after a methionine overload of 0.1 g/kg body weight in patients and controls. Afterwards, the odds ratio for homocysteinaemia was determined by homocysteine level, and that for hyperhomocysteinaemia (homocysteine level &gt; 34 mumol/l) by age group.RESULTS: After methionine loading, the homocysteine odds ratio varied from 0.47 (homocysteine level &lt; 23 mumol/l) to 2.88 (homocysteine level &gt; 34 mumol/l). In patients under the age of 46 the odds ratio for hyperhomocysteinaemia was 18.6. In patients between 46 and 55 years of age the odds ratio for hyperhomocysteinaemia was 1.2.CONCLUSIONS: Low homocysteine levels are protective against CAD, and the higher the homocysteine level the higher the coronary risk appears to be. This clearly means that heterozygosity for cystathionine beta synthase deficiency alone is not enough to explain the vascular risk associated with homocysteinaemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia was shown to be a significant risk factor only in patients under the age of 46 years old.

Homocyst(e)ine [H(e)], the sum of homocysteine, homocystine, and the homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide, free and protein-bound, has been shown to be associated in retrospective case control studies, and in one prospective study, with vascular disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Elevated levels of homocyst(e)ine severe enough to cause homocystinuria are seen in severe nutritional deficiencies of vitamin B12, folic acid and vitamin B6. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 synthesis of 5'-10'-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase, or the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase may cause severe hyperhomocyst(e)inemia and homocystinuria. The clinical manifestation of these disorders are mental retardation, neurological disorders, and widespread thromboembolic phenomena. The measurement of H(e) is currently performed using high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Other methods, especially mass spectroscopy, are also used. Internal standards using increasing concentrations of homocystine and acetylcysteine and several external standards are used to ensure accuracy of the assay. Milder elevations of H(e) have recently been associated with vascular disease, in both men and women. The strength of this association appears to be stronger for peripheral and cerebrovascular disease than for CAD. Nevertheless, several case control studies in Europe, Canada, and the United States have shown that H(e) levels are elevated in CAD patients compared with controls, and H(e) levels are independent of the conventional cardiovascular risk factors (age, gender, lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol levels, hypertension, or cigarette smoking). One prospective study, the Physicians' Health Study, has shown that H(e) levels are slightly but significantly higher in CAD cases vs controls in a population of US physicians.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Studies by various investigators have indicated that elevated levels of plasma homocyst(e)ine are strongly associated with the occurrence of occlusive vascular diseases. With the eventual aim of determining whether or not elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations are directly causative of cardiovascular diseases, we have generated mice that are moderately and severely homocyst(e)inemic. Homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells was used to inactivate the cystathionine beta-synthase [L-serine hydrolyase (adding homocysteine), EC 4.2.1.22] gene. Homozygous mutants completely lacking cystathionine beta-synthase were born at the expected frequency from matings of heterozygotes, but they suffered from severe growth retardation and a majority of them died within 5 weeks after birth. Histological examination showed that the hepatocytes of homozygotes were enlarged, multinucleated, and filled with microvesicular lipid droplets. Plasma homocyst(e)ine levels of the homozygotes were approximately 40 times normal. These mice, therefore, represent a model for severe homocyst(e)inemia resulting from the complete lack of cystathionine beta-synthase. Heterozygous mutants have approximately 50% reduction in cystathionine beta-synthase mRNA and enzyme activity in the liver and have twice normal plasma homocyst(e)ine levels. Thus, the heterozygous mutants are promising for studying the in vivo role of elevated levels of homocyst(e)ine in the etiology of cardiovascular diseases.

Thermolability of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) was examined as a possible cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with premature vascular disease. Control subjects and vascular patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemia and with normohomocysteinemia were studied. The mean (+/- SD) specific MTHFR activity in lymphocytes of 22 control subjects was 15.6 (+/- 4.7) nmol CH2O/mg protein/h (range: 9.1-26.6), and the residual activity (+/- SD) after heat inactivation for 5 min at 46 degrees C was 55.3 (+/- 12.0)% (range: 35.9-78.3). By measurement of MTHFR activity, two distinct subgroups of hyperhomocysteinemic patients became evident. One group (n = 11) had thermolabile MTHFR with a mean (+/- SD) specific activity of 8.7 (+/- 2.1) nmol CH2O/mg protein/h (range: 5.5-12.7) and a residual activity, after heat inactivation, ranging from 0% to 33%. The other group (n = 28) had normal specific activity (+/- SD) of 21.5 (+/- 7.2) nmol CH2O/mg protein/h (range: 10.0-39.0) and a normal residual activity (+/- SD) of 53.8 (+/- 9.2)% (range: 33.1-71.5) after heat inactivation. The mean (+/- SD) specific activity of 29 normohomocysteinemic patients was 20.7 (+/- 6.5) nmol CH2O/mg protein/h (range: 9.4-33.8), and the mean (+/- SD) residual activity after heat inactivation was 58.2 (+/- 10.2)% (range: 43.0-82.0). Thus, in 28% of the hyperhomocysteinemic patients with premature vascular disease, abnormal homocysteine metabolism could be attributed to thermolabile MTHFR.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine-beta-synthase deficiency (CBS-def-HOCY) initially often presents with vascular disorders, e.g. thromboembolic events. The measurement of vascular endothelial markers in plasma could help to assess endothelial damage. We determined von Willebrand factor (measured as Ristocetincofactor, RiCoF) and thrombomodulin (TM), two endothelial cell markers to our knowledge not measured systematically before in homocystinuria patients in a longitudinal study of two homocystinuric patients: Patient1 with thromboembolic disease and his asymptomatic sister, patient2. Before start of therapy in patient 1, TM and RiCoF levels both were increased. In patient 2 a moderately elevated RiCoF and a normal level of TM were found. Vitamin therapy with 15 mg folate and 600 mg pyridoxine per day led to almost complete normalization of amino acids in urine and plasma, and complete normalization of RiCoF and TM levels in both patients. Thus, TM and RiCoF elevations demonstrate that CBS-def-HOCY leads to endothelial cell damage, which resolved under vitamin therapy in the patients studied.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia are inherited disorders of metabolism that are associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease. This study addresses the possibility that different patterns of carotid wall damage and cerebral blood flow hemodynamics are present in these two metabolic diseases.METHODS: Twelve patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (mean age, 24 years), 10 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (mean age, 26 years), and 11 healthy control subjects (mean age, 26 years) underwent a vascular examination by noninvasive methods. B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to obtain measurements of intima-media thickness of common carotid, bifurcation, and internal carotid arteries as an index of atherosclerosis. Cerebral blood flow velocity was estimated from vascular examination of the middle cerebral artery by transcranial Doppler. Systolic, diastolic, and mean velocities were measured. Pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was also calculated.RESULTS: Mean maximum intima-media thickness was 1.4 mm in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, 0.6 mm in patients with homocystinuria, and 0.6 mm in control subjects. The difference between hypercholesterolemic and homocystinuric patients or control subjects was statistically significant (P &lt; .001). Diastolic blood flow velocities were significantly reduced in the middle cerebral arteries of hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or control subjects (P &lt; .05), whereas systolic or mean velocities did not differ. The pulsatility index, a possible indicator of vascular resistance in the cerebral circulation, was significantly higher in hypercholesterolemic patients compared with homocystinuric patients or healthy control subjects (P &lt; .01). A direct relation was demonstrated between pulsatility index of the middle cerebral artery and mean maximum intima-media thickness of carotid arteries on the same side (P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: Familial hypercholesterolemia is responsible for diffuse and focal thickening of carotid arteries and possibly also for hyperlipidemic endothelial dysfunction extending to small resistance arteries and leading to a disturbed cerebral blood flow. Patients with homocystinuria due to homozygosis for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency seldom have plaques in their carotid arteries. They are similar to healthy control subjects with regard to both intima-media thickness and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. Therefore, it is unlikely that typical atherosclerotic lesions precede thrombotic events in homocystinuria. However, it is possible that arterial dilatations caused by medial damage lead to thrombosis in homocystinuric patients.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is the major cause of homocystinuria in humans. The most frequent symptoms of homocystinuria include: dislocated optic lenses, vascular disorders, skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. Patients with this deficiency have elevated levels of homocyst(e)ine, methionine and low cysteine in their body fluids. These abnormal levels often partially or fully normalize upon treatment with pharmacological doses of vitamin B6. To investigate the molecular and biochemical basis for these conditions, it was necessary to determine the nucleotide and polypeptide sequence of CBS. We report here the human CBS cDNA sequence of 2,554 nucleotides encoding the CBS subunit of 551 amino acids. An intron of 214 bp appears to be retained in the 3'-untranslated region of most of the fibroblast and liver mRNA. We also report a frequent Mspl polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated sequence and two synonymous mutations in the coding region: 699C/T (Y233Y) and 1080C/T (A360A). The amino acid sequence similarity of human and rat CBS is greater than 90%; the enzyme also exhibits 52% similarity to O-acetylserine(thiol)-lyase from bacteria and plants. Lastly, we demonstrate that expression of the human enzyme in CHO cells yields enzymatically active protein of the expected size with a half-life of approximately 14 hrs.

Mild homocysteinemia occurs surprisingly often in patients with premature vascular disease. We studied the possible enzymatic sources of this mild hyperhomocysteinemia and the control of homocysteine levels in plasma by treatment of patients with the cofactors and cosubstrates of homocysteine catabolism. We assessed homocysteine metabolism in 131 patients who had premature disease in their coronary, peripheral, or cerebrovascular circulation by using a standard oral methionine-load test. Impaired homocysteine metabolism occurred in 28 patients. We assayed levels of the primary enzymes of homocysteine catabolism in cultured skin fibroblast extracts from 15 of these 28 patients. The patients' cystathionine beta-synthase levels (3.68 +/- 2.52 nmol/h per milligram of cell protein, mean +/- SD) were markedly depressed compared with those from 31 healthy adult control subjects (7.61 +/- 4.49, P &lt; .001). The patients' levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate: homocysteine methyltransferase were normal. While betaine: homocysteine methyltransferase was not expressed in skin fibroblasts, 24-hour urinary betaine and N,N-dimethylglycine measurements were consistent with normal or enhanced remethylation of homocysteine by betaine: homocysteine methyltransferase in the 13 patients tested. When treated daily with choline and betaine, pyridoxine, or folic acid, there was a normalization of the postmethionine plasma homocysteine level in 16 of 19 patients. Our results indicate that mild homocysteinemia in premature vascular disease may be caused by either a folate deficiency or deficiencies in cystathionine beta-synthase activity. It does not necessarily involve deficiencies of either 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase. Effective treatment regimens are also defined.

Elevated circulating homocyst(e)ine is a risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. We explored whether elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine is associated with increased plasma lipid hydroperoxides that might trigger vascular disease. We obtained plasma containing high levels of homocyst(e)ine from four patients with a homozygous deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase activity and also from four heterozygotes with a deficiency of this enzyme after an oral methionine load. The mean plasma non-protein-bound homocyst(e)ine level in all subjects was more than 11-fold higher than the mean normal fasting value. Levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CEOOH), normalized against the concentration of free cholesterol in HDL, were not elevated in our subjects (mean +/- SD, 0.0091 +/- 0.0061) compared with values for 14 fasting healthy donors (0.0164 +/- 0.0086). An inverse dependency was observed between plasma total homocyst(e)ine and HDL CEOOH (r = -0.78, p = 0.023). Also, the ubiquinol-10/ubiquinone-10 ratio in HDL, which is expected to fall during oxidative stress, increased with plasma homocyst(e)ine. Since HDL contains the majority of detectable plasma lipid hydroperoxides, of which CEOOHs are the most abundant, our data suggest that an elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine level does not enhance oxidative stress, increase the levels of lipid hydroperoxides in plasma, or generate vascular damage by this mechanism.

Homocystinuria is frequently associated with severe multisystem involvement such as dislocated lenses, skeletal deformities, mental retardation and premature vascular occlusions. Surprisingly, gastro-intestinal involvement has not been described in this disorder. We present a 17 year old boy with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, who developed severe gastrointestinal involvement, manifested by chronic diarrhoea and acute pancreatitis. The diarrhoea was successfully treated with betaine. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms and suggested treatment are described.

We measured the vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and folic acid nutritional status in a group of apparently healthy men (n = 44) with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (plasma homocysteine concentration &gt; 16.3 mumol/L). Compared with control subjects (n = 274) with normal plasma homocysteine (&lt; or = 16.3 mumol/L) concentrations, significantly lower plasma concentrations of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (P &lt; 0.001), cobalamin (P &lt; 0.001), and folic acid (P = 0.004) were demonstrated in hyperhomocysteinemic men. The prevalence of suboptimal vitamin B-6, B-12, and folate status in men with hyperhomocysteinemia was 25.0%, 56.8%, and 59.1%, respectively. In a placebo-controlled follow-up study, a daily vitamin supplement (10 mg pyridoxal, 1.0 mg folic acid, 0.4 mg cyanocobalamin) normalized elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations within 6 wk. Because hyperhomocysteinemia is implicated as a risk factor for premature occlusive vascular disease, appropriate vitamin therapy may be both efficient and cost-effective to control elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations.

Elevated plasma homocysteine enhances the risk of thrombosis and premature arteriosclerosis. We have assessed the activity of the 3 prime enzymes of homocysteine metabolism in cultured human venous endothelial cells, in a study of their possible protective roles. In cells from 4 individuals, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, the mean activity +/- S.D. of cystathionine beta-synthase (nmol of product/h per mg of cell protein, at 37 degrees C) was 3.58 +/- 3.11 at pH 8.6. The assay used was our newly developed amino acid analyser-based procedure. The activity of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase at pH 7.4 was 4.12 +/- 1.25 and betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) was undetectable (&lt; 1.4 nmol/h per mg protein). Cells were also cultured in a medium aimed at stimulating methionine biosynthesis, containing methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium to which L-homocystine (100 mumol/l) and methylcobalamin (1 mumol/l) had been added. In these cells 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase activity increased to 7.95 +/- 1.45, P &lt; 0.001, there was a non-significant decrease in cystathionine beta-synthase activity to 2.16 +/- 1.52 and BHMT activity was still undetectable. These cells were more resistant to in vitro homocysteine-induced detachment than were cells from the same line cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium alone. Our findings establish that human endothelial cells express 2 of the 3 primary enzymes of homocysteine catabolism. They suggest that persons who are deficient in cystathionine beta-synthase or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase activity may not only develop homocysteinemia, but also have vascular endothelium which is more susceptible to damage by homocysteine than persons with normal enzyme levels.

Hyperhomocysteinemia has been suggested as a potent new risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease. Homocsyteine can induce endothelial cell injury but the mechanism is not understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of free radicals as potential causes of endothelial cell injury in a case-control study of obligate heterozygotes for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Firstly, free radical production as measured by neutrophil chemiluminescence in obligate heterozygotes for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency was compared with age- and sex-matched normal subjects. Secondly, the response of the cellular antioxidant system was examined by measuring the enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, their cofactors (selenium, copper), vitamin E and vitamin A in heterozygotes and normal subjects. Analyses of neutrophil chemiluminescence, vitamin A and E, glutathione peroxidase, selenium and copper showed no difference between heterozygotes and controls. While superoxide dismutase activity was higher in heterozygotes than normal subjects, the difference did not reach statistical significance and the hypothesis of excess free radical production as a mechanism of injury was not confirmed. However, further examination of superoxide dismutase activity in a larger number of subjects would be of interest.

In order to clarify whether cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) could differentiate groups of patients with various vascular diagnosis, CBS was studied in cultured human skin fibroblasts from 99 human subjects diagnosed as homozygotes or heterozygotes for CBS deficiency or suffering from atherosclerotic vascular disease or Down's syndrome (prone to less atherosclerosis). In addition, embryonic human skin fibroblasts and controls were analysed for CBS. We found significant group differences but the overlap in the hetero- and homozygotes for CBS deficiency was too extensive to allow any individual diagnosis based on cell culture studies. CBS activity was significantly lower in the atherosclerotic patients as compared to control subjects. The difference was mostly due to much higher CBS activity in the younger controls. Age dependency was markedly emphasized by very high values from embryonic cells. A strong negative correlation was noted for age and CBS activity in control subjects but not in the atherosclerotic patients. The results are important for the discussion of homocysteine in atherosclerosis and point to the importance of donor age on CBS activity in cultured cells. In addition, diagnosis of hetero-homozygosity for CBS activity is not possible on an individual basis by this method. Further studies in cell culture systems are needed to investigate if young patients (less than 45 years old) with atherosclerotic disease could be identified by low CBS activity in fibroblast cultures as indicated by this study.

Hyperhomocysteinemia arising from impaired methionine metabolism, and usually due to a deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase is a significant and independent risk factor for symptomatic vascular disease. It is not known if hyperhomocysteinemia in apparently healthy asymptomatic subjects is associated with atherosclerosis and whether such a relationship is independent of conventional risk factors. The prevalence of asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis was determined by duplex ultrasound examination in 25 obligate heterozygotes with respect for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (whose children were known to be homozygous for this genetic defect) and in 21 controls. Hyperhomocysteinemia was determined by a standard methionine-loading test and conventional risk factors were also recorded. Twelve of 25 obligate heterozygotes and 8 of 21 normal controls had evidence of extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis. Hyperhomocysteinemia as a genetic trait was not a significant risk marker, but the actual homocysteine level was associated with an increased risk of carotid disease. After adjustment for the effects of other significant risk factors, the odds ratio of hyperhomocysteinemia for carotid disease was 1.038 per unit increase in homocysteine level (P = 0.03). Hyperhomocysteinemia is a weak risk factor for asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerosis and the relative risk associated with this genetic trait is less than that observed in a study of patients presenting with clinical manifestations of vascular disease.

Thrombotic and thromboembolic complications are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with homocystinuria. However, it is unusual for thrombosis to be the single clinical feature leading to investigation for homocystinuria. We report an academically superior teenage boy who presented with sagittal sinus thrombosis, papilledema, transient right hemiparesis, and pneumothoraces. Pyridoxine-unresponsive homocystinuria was diagnosed by aminogram, enzyme assay, and clinical trial. Treatment has been with methionine restriction and betaine. Homocystinuria should be considered in patients with unusual vascular lesions or premature thromboembolism.

Previous work with cultured mammalian cells and perfused laboratory animals suggested to us that hydrolysis of homocysteine thiolactone was catalyzed in these systems. We confirmed this finding by measuring the sulfhydryl-releasing activity of cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical arteries in homocysteine thiolactone solution, pH 7.4, 37 degrees C. The reaction was vigorous and stereospecific and showed saturation kinetics (Km values for L- and D,L-homocysteine thiolactone were 3.9 and 8.2 mmol/l, respectively, and Vmax values were 10.75 and 10.1 mumol/min/10(9) cells, respectively). L-Homocysteine thiolactone was quantitatively converted to homocysteine, as measured by amino acid analysis. Human serum also accelerated the elimination of homocysteine thiolactone, although in this process, the majority of the newly formed sulfhydryl-containing product was precipitable by sulfosalicylic acid, indicating likely homocysteinylation of serum proteins. However, approximately 38% of the sulfhydryl-containing product was not precipitated, and because thiolactone elimination stereospecifically favored the L-enantiomer, a possible subsidiary role for serum-catalyzed hydrolysis of the thiolactone was suggested. No homocysteine thiolactone could be found in serum samples from six patients with acute myocardial infarction, three patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, and six normal subjects. Thus, humans have active vascular systems for elimination of homocysteine thiolactone, a process that could be responsible for an absence of the compound in serum.

BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia arising from impaired methionine metabolism, probably usually due to a deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase, is associated with premature cerebral, peripheral, and possibly coronary vascular disease. Both the strength of this association and its independence of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are uncertain. We studied the extent to which the association could be explained by heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.METHODS: We first established a diagnostic criterion for hyperhomocysteinemia by comparing peak serum levels of homocysteine after a standard methionine-loading test in 25 obligate heterozygotes with respect to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (whose children were known to be homozygous for homocystinuria due to this enzyme defect) with the levels in 27 unrelated age- and sex-matched normal subjects. A level of 24.0 mumol per liter or more was 92 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific in distinguishing the two groups. The peak serum homocysteine levels in these normal subjects were then compared with those in 123 patients whose vascular disease had been diagnosed before they were 55 years of age.RESULTS: Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 16 of 38 patients with cerebrovascular disease (42 percent), 7 of 25 with peripheral vascular disease (28 percent), and 18 of 60 with coronary vascular disease (30 percent), but in none of the 27 normal subjects. After adjustment for the effects of conventional risk factors, the lower 95 percent confidence limit for the odds ratio for vascular disease among the patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, as compared with the normal subjects, was 3.2. The geometric-mean peak serum homocysteine level was 1.33 times higher in the patients with vascular disease than in the normal subjects (P = 0.002). The presence of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency was confirmed in 18 of 23 patients with vascular disease who had hyperhomocysteinemia.CONCLUSIONS: Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular disease, including coronary disease, and in most instances is probably due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.

Fourteen patients (six males, eight females; mean age, 20 years) with homocystinuria due to homozygous cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, underwent a vascular examination. Fourteen heterozygotes (seven males, seven females; mean age, 46 years), including 12 parents and one daughter of homozygotes (obligate heterozygotes), and one sister of a homozygote (with low enzyme activity as evaluated in vitro), were also examined. Homozygotes and heterozygotes were compared with two separate control groups of different age (mean age, 20 and 43 years, respectively). Ankle/arm systolic pressure index (by continuous-wave Doppler) was, on average, lower in homozygotes (P less than .01) and heterozygotes (P less than .05) as compared with the controls. An ankle/arm index less than 0.97 and suggesting flow-reducing arterial lesions was found in six (21%) lower limbs of homozygotes versus zero in controls (P less than .05). Echo Doppler (Duplex Scanner) abnormalities, indicating early, non-flow-reducing lesions of iliac arteries were more frequent in homozygotes (seven wall abnormalities or stenoses less than 15%) than in young controls (P less than .05). The corresponding figures for heterozygotes were seven wall abnormalities or stenoses (1% to 15% and one stenosis 16% to 50%) (P less than .01 v middle-aged controls). Early lesions (three wall abnormalities or stenoses less than 15%, three stenoses 16% to 50%) were detected in six (23%) internal carotids of heterozygotes versus three (3%) of corresponding controls (P less than .05). Technical limitations precluded the accurate detection of early lesions in the internal carotid arteries of young homozygotes and controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Excess homocysteine in body fluids has been implicated as a factor in the pathogenesis of occlusive vascular disease (peripheral and cerebrovascular arterial disease, and perhaps coronary artery disease). Heterozygotes for inborn errors of homocysteine metabolism (transsulfuration or remethylation pathways) are much more frequent than are homozygotes/compounds. If heterozygotes are at increased risk (a question not addressed here), it is of interest to know whether they can be identified consistently by a &quot;screening&quot; measurement of blood homocyst(e)ine. We used hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (cystathioninemia beta-synthase deficiency) as a test case. From reviews of metabolite values in blood samples either fasting (11 articles) or after a methionine load (8 articles), and of measures of enzyme activity (12 articles), it is apparent that (1) The heterozygous phenotype cannot be identified consistently by any single measure (there is overlap with normal values); and (2) the exaggerated gene dosage effect (negative allelic complementation) present in most heterozygotes does not assist their classification. The failure of enzyme assay to distinguish heterozygotes consistently (relative to normal values) may reflect allelic heterogeneity. The failure of metabolic values to identify heterozygotes consistently reflects the local and global properties of the homeostatic system controlling the homocysteine pool size. The problem described here is a particular example of a general one in physiological and medical genetics, namely detection of heterozygotes for recessive alleles, affecting metabolic homeostasis, for purposes of medical intervention and for genetic counselling.

Homocystinuria is an inborn error of methionine metabolism, of which cause is mainly deficiency of cystathionine synthetase. The major clinical manifestations of homocystinuria are mental retardation, seizures, ectopia lentis, skeletal deformities and occlusive vascular disease. A case of homocystinuria accompanied with deep cerebral venous thrombosis was reported. A 29-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with unconsciousness and tetraparesis on December 7, 1984. She was diagnosed as homocystinuria due to cystathionine synthetase deficiency at 13-year-old. Amino acid analysis of serum revealed homocystinaemia (1.37 mg/dl, normal 0), hypermethioninaemia (1.27 mg/dl, normal 0.2-0.48) and low cystathionine content. CT scan revealed intraventricular hemorrhage and diffuse low density in basal ganglia and white matter. Cerebral angiograms showed that deep cerebral veins and superior sagittal sinus can not be recognized clearly in any phase, and Sylvian veins are opacified markedly. It is suggested that intraventricular hemorrhage, and low density area in basal ganglia and white matter is due to hemorrhagic infarction by venous thrombosis of internal cerebral vein. The major clinical manifestations of homocystinuria result from the elevated plasma homocysteine level. The excitotoxic effect of homocysteic acid accounts for mental retardation and seizures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Severe homocysteinemia due to genetic defects either of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or of enzymes in vitamin B12 and folate metabolism is associated with very early-onset vascular disease. Therefore, we studied homocysteine metabolism in 72 patients presenting before the age of 55 years with occlusive arterial disease of cerebral, carotid, or aorto-iliac vessels. Twenty patients (28%) had basal homocysteinemia; and 26 patients (36%) had abnormal increases of plasma homocysteine after peroral methionine loading, which exceeded the highest value for 46 comparable controls and was within the range for 20 obligate heterozygotes for homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency. Basal plasma homocysteine content was strongly and negatively correlated to vitamin B12 and folate concentrations. Plasma PLP was depressed in most patients but there was no correlation between PLP and homocysteine values. In 20 patients, treatment with pyridoxine hydrochloride (240 mg/day) and folic acid (10 mg/day) reduced fasting homocysteine after 4 weeks by a mean of 53%, and methionine response by a mean of 39%. These data show that a substantial proportion of patients with early-onset vascular disease have impaired homocysteine metabolism, which may contribute to vascular disease, and that the impaired metabolism can be improved easily and without side effects.

Homocysteine is a branch-point metabolite, the biological fate of which is linked to vitamin B12, reduced folates and vitamin B6. Various inborn defects in homocysteine metabolism, among which cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency is most common, lead to the clinical condition homocystinuria. A central feature of this clinical state is premature arteriosclerosis. These patients benefit from agents serving as cofactors in homocysteine metabolism which both reduce the homocysteine levels in plasma and the incidence of vascular episodes. Experimental data point to homocysteine as an arteriosclerotic agent. Homocysteine in human plasma exists mainly as mixed disulfides with albumin (70 per cent) and cysteine. New methods determine total plasma homocysteine which includes all these species. Normal values for plasma homocysteine are lower in premenopausal women than in men and postmenopausal women. Impaired homocysteine metabolism seems to exist in 15-30 per cent of patients with premature cardiovascular disease. Moderate homocysteinemia is as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, independent of conventional risk factors. Apart from homocystinuria, vitamin B12 deficiency causes the most extreme elevations of plasma homocysteine, and it has been established that plasma homocysteine is a more responsive parameter to impaired vitamin B12 function than serum cobalamin. Massive increase in plasma homocysteine level is also observed in folate deficiency, whereas renal failure, some malignant states and psoriasis cause a moderate homocysteinemia. High doses of folic acid reduce plasma homocysteine, and this innocuous mean should be considered as an intervention in patients with increased plasma level. Drugs like methotrexate, some anticonvulsants and 6-azauridine triacetate induce moderate elevation of plasma homocysteine, whereas a reduction is observed after penicillamine administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Sulfur amino acids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic vascular disease, and observations of patients with several inborn errors of metabolism have led to the 'homocysteine theory of arteriosclerosis'. Homocysteine is an intermediate in the transsulfuration pathway and it enters into several other reactions, some of which involve transfer of methyl groups. An abnormally high concentration of homocysteine in the blood causes homocystinuria. Deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase is the most frequent cause of homocystinuria. Patients with this disorder are at risk for early vascular occlusions. Treatment with vitamin B6 of patients who are biochemically responsive to this vitamin reduces the risk of thromboembolism. Clinical or pathologic evidence of early vascular disease has also been provided in patients with homocysteinemia due to deficient (re)methylation of homocysteine to methionine. This may be caused by a deficiency of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or by a deficient synthesis of cobalamins.

In three different studies we tested the hypothesis that early-onset vascular disease is associated with impaired homocysteine metabolism which could contribute to the development of arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. In patients with occlusive vascular disease before the age of 60, a post-methionine load increase of plasma homocysteine exceeding the highest value for comparable healthy control subjects was found in 1 of 21 with myocardial infarction (5%), 14 of 37 with aorto-iliac disease (38%), and 17 of 53 with cerebrovascular disease (32%). This might indicate heterozygosity for homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Concentrations of serum vitamin B12 and red cell folate had an important modulating effect on plasma homocysteine concentrations in the fasting state.

Thrombogenesis and accelerated atherogenesis occur in the homocystinurias, both those due to recessively inherited cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and to disorders of remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The evidence strongly implicates high levels of plasma homocysteine as the mediator. Homocysteine damages cultured human venous and arterial endothelial cells and enhances detachment from their substrate, changes not found with comparable concentrations of other amino acids tested. Homocysteine is oxidized in vitro to homocystine in an oxygen-dependent reaction producing hydrogen peroxide. Since the effects of homocysteine in cell cultures can be prevented by catalase, hydrogen-peroxide-induced injury may be the mechanism responsible. Five different laboratories have documented an association between mild homocysteinaemia and premature vascular disease. The majority of affected patients are heterozygotes for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency whose endothelial cells may have an enhanced susceptibility to injury by homocysteine. Mild homocysteinaemia also occurs in chronic renal failure in which vascular disease is prominent. Mechanisms linking mild homocysteinaemia and possible vascular effects are not yet understood, but could involve prostaglandins and oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and possibly also free radicals.

Homocysteine is an amino acid considered to cause vascular injury, arteriosclerosis, and thromboembolism. Total plasma homocysteine (free and protein-bound) was found to be twice as high in asymptomatic vitamin B12-deficient subjects (23.8 +/- 3.8 mumol/L, means +/- SEM, n = 20) as in controls (11.5 +/- 0.9 mumol/L, P less than .0001, n = 21), and higher than in heterozygotes for homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (13.8 +/- 1.6 mumol/L, P less than .01, n = 14), who were recently shown to be much more common among patients with premature vascular disease than expected. Eight (40%) vitamin B12-deficient and two (14%) heterozygote subjects had significant homocysteinemia (greater than mean +2 SD for controls). After administration of hydroxycobalamin to vitamin B12-deficient subjects, homocysteine levels decreased to normal (-49%, 12.2 +/- 1.5 mumol/L, P less than .0001, n = 20). Thus, if homocysteine does cause vascular injury, theoretically vitamin B12-deficiency might be associated with an increased frequency of vascular disease.

Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency may be responsive to pyridoxine, a precursor of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate, and the amount of residual enzyme activity present is the probable determinant of this. In six treated pyridoxine-responsive patients whose biochemical control of fasting plasma amino acid levels appeared optimal, we assessed the effects on plasma amino acids of standard oral methionine loads (4g/m2 of body area) before and after adding betaine (trimethylglycine) 6 g/d, to the treatment regimen of pyridoxine and folic acid. Our aim was to define the capacity of these patients to metabolize methionine and to determine whether betaine would effect a reduction in postload homocysteine levels. During the 24 hours after the methionine challenge all patients had higher plasma methionine and homocysteine and lower cysteine than did 17 normal subjects. After betaine these homocysteine responses were reduced to near normal, and there was a trend toward increased methionine. There was a direct correlation between premethionine fasting homocysteine and mean homocysteine responses during the 24 hours following the methionine load, both before (r = 0.79) and after betaine (r = 0.71). Betaine also increased plasma cysteine levels in patients with the more severe biochemical abnormalities. After betaine there were modest increases in plasma serine (mean increase 25%; P less than 0.025). Since the vascular complications of homocystinuria are related to increased plasma homocysteine, betaine therapy may reduce this risk in patients receiving a standard pyridoxine and folic acid regimen in whom there are abnormal homocysteine responses after a standard methionine load.

Highly elevated concentrations of homocysteine measured as homocysteine or cysteine-homocysteine mixed disulfide (MDS) are found in plasma and urine in subjects with inherited abnormalities of the methionine metabolism. These subjects have a high incidence of arteriosclerotic vascular complications during childhood. Homocysteine causes endothelial cell injury and cell detachment that initiates the development of arteriosclerosis. The present study demonstrates a significantly elevated mean plasma MDS concentration in 19 patients with arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease compared to 17 controls. Our findings suggest that moderate homocysteinemia might be a risk factor for arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.

The treatment of homocystinuria that is not responsive to pyridoxine is not usually biochemically or clinically successful, and vascular, ocular, and skeletal complications commonly supervene. Persistent marked homocysteinemia appears to be the most important biochemical disturbance leading to these complications. Ten patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency that was not responsive to pyridoxine and one patient with homocystinuria due to a defect in cobalamin metabolism were treated with 6 g daily of betaine added to conventional therapy, to improve homocysteine remethylation. All patients had a substantial decrease in plasma total homocysteine levels (P less than 0.001) and an increase in total cysteine levels (P less than 0.001). Changes in plasma methionine concentrations were variable. Fasting levels of plasma amino acids became normal in two patients, and in six there was immediate clinical improvement. There were no unwanted effects. We conclude that treatment of homocystinuria that is not responsive to pyridoxine and of disorders of homocysteine remethylation should include betaine in adequate doses to ensure maximum lowering of elevated plasma homocysteine levels.

We measured blood copper-containing proteins and plasma total copper in 15 patients with homocystinuria (14 with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and one with abnormal cobalamin metabolism), in 13 heterozygotes for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, and in 44 normal subjects. Plasma total copper was increased in patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency compared with age- and sex-matched controls; the ratio was 1.41 +/- 0.14 for females and 1.39 +/- 0.15 for males (means +/- SD). This was due to corresponding increases in caeruloplasmin concentrations, but levels were unrelated to total plasma homocysteine. Erythrocyte superoxide dismutase levels were normal. The heterozygotes had normal plasma copper and caeruloplasmin levels. The increased copper and caeruloplasmin may contribute to the precocious atherogenesis occurring in homocystinuria by decreasing the adhesion of vascular endothelial cells to the intima. It is unlikely that decreased lysyl oxidase activity due to chelation of copper by homocysteine is important for the pathogenesis of the connective tissue defect in homocystinuria.

There is as yet no satisfactory experimental model for homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. We produced homocysteinemia in pigs for up to 60 days by continuously infusing DL-homocysteine thiolactone and compared the changes in the plasma amino acids with the findings in 16 patients with homocystinuria. Vascular morphology was also investigated in the infused animals. In six pigs DL-homocysteine thiolactone, 0.68/kg/day for 13-60 days increased mean levels of methionine from 43.6 to 116.6 mumole/l, homocystine from zero to 67.4, cysteine-homocysteine disulfide from 4.3 to 49.2, taurine from 97.3 to 193.9 and alpha-amino-n-butyric acid from 16.5 to 147.4. Total cysteine did not change although cystine decreased from 50.8 to 26.2 mumole/liter. There were no amino acid changes in four saline infused (control) pigs and no differences in vascular morphology between experimental and control animals. Seven severely affected homocystinuric patients, biochemically, unresponsive to pyridoxine administration, had plasma sulfur-containing amino acid changes of similar magnitude to those in the infused pigs except that taurine concentrations were normal and total cysteine was decreased as it also was in nine pyridoxine responsive patients. In contrast to the pigs, plasma alpha-amino-n-butyric acid was normal in all 16 patients. We conclude that this model provides information about methionine metabolism but that it should be used with caution to study mechanisms in homocystinuria because it does not exactly mimic the human disease and because the thiolactone, which at present must be used as the source of infused L-homocysteine, itself produces changes which could influence results.

Normal hemostasis depends in part on the balance achieved between proaggregatory and prothrombotic platelet thromboxane A2, measured as its stable end-product thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and vascular prostacyclin (PGI2), which inhibits platelet aggregation and is antithrombotic. Cystathionine-beta-synthase deficiency is characterized by a high frequency of thromboembolic disease. We therefore studied, in vitro, the effects of homocysteine and related compounds on platelet TXB2 and vascular PGI2 formation. In paired samples of platelet rich plasma, which had been preincubated with L-homocystine (1 mM), mean production of the two platelet cyclooxygenase products, TXB2 and 12-hydroxy-5, 8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid increased significantly from control levels [13.6% +/- 1.9 to 19.8% +/- 2.1 (P less than 0.02) TXB2 and 29.8% +/- 4.2 to 39.4% +/- 4.1 (P less than 0.01) HHT]. In the presence of D,L-homocysteine (1 mM), mean TXB2 and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid production was also significantly increased [12.7% +/- 1.5 to 16.9% +/- 1.5 (P less than 0.01) TXB2 and 27% +/- 4 to 31% +/- 4.1 (P less than 0.02) HHT]. Cystine, cysteine, or methionine (1 mM) did not have similar effects in this test system. Homocysteine and homocystine were without effect on the synthesis of vascular PGI2 by umbilical artery segments [control, 0.22 +/- 0.03 to 0.21 +/- 0.03 ng/mg with D,L-homocysteine and 0.20 +/- 0.04 control to 0.19 +/- 0.04 ng/mg with D,L-homocystine]. A homocyst(e)ine-induced increase in platelet thromboxane production in the absence of an increase in vascular prostacyclin, if present in vivo, may contribute to the vascular thromboses characteristic of human homocystinemias (homocystinurias).

Homocystinuria with elevated plasma homocysteine and methionine levels is the result of deficient activity of cystathionine synthetase, the enzyme catalyzing conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with a worldwide distribution. The major clinical manifestations result from the elevated plasma homocysteine level. The excitotoxic effect of homocysteic acid accounts for mental retardation and seizures. Interference with collagen cross-linking by sulfhydryl groups of homocysteine causes ectopia lentis and skeletal deformities. Sulfation factor-like effects contribute to disruption of vascular endothelium, which is followed by platelet thrombosis and widespread arterial and venous occlusions. Low methionine homocystinuria, with deficient remethylation of homocysteine, results from deranged vitamin B(12) metabolism and from deficient 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase. Administration of azaribine produces homocystinuria by mechanism not yet elucidated.
