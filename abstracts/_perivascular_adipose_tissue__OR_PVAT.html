<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a vital role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, most studies ascribed the function of PVAT in vascular remodeling to adipokines secreted by the perivascular adipocytes. Whether mesenchymal stem cells exist in PVAT and play a role in vascular regeneration remain unknown. Approach and Results: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allowed direct visualization of the heterogeneous PVAT-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PV-ADSCs) at a high resolution and revealed 2 distinct subpopulations, among which one featured signaling pathways crucial for smooth muscle differentiation. Pseudotime analysis of cultured PV-ADSCs unraveled their smooth muscle differentiation trajectory. Transplantation of cultured PV-ADSCs in mouse vein graft model suggested the contribution of PV-ADSCs to vascular remodeling through smooth muscle differentiation. Mechanistically, treatment with TGF-ß1 (transforming growth factor ß1) and transfection of microRNA (miR)-378a-3p mimics induced a similar metabolic reprogramming of PV-ADSCs, including upregulated mitochondrial potential and altered lipid levels, such as increased cholesterol and promoted smooth muscle differentiation.CONCLUSIONS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing allows direct visualization of PV-ADSC heterogeneity at a single-cell level and uncovers 2 subpopulations with distinct signature genes and signaling pathways. The function of PVAT in vascular regeneration is partly attributed to PV-ADSCs and their differentiation towards smooth muscle lineage. Mechanistic study presents miR-378a-3p which is a potent regulator of metabolic reprogramming as a potential therapeutic target for vascular regeneration.</p>

<p>Obesity is increasingly prevalent and is associated with substantial cardiovascular risk. Adipose tissue distribution and morphology play a key role in determining the degree of adverse effects, and a key factor in the disease process appears to be the inflammatory cell population in adipose tissue. Healthy adipose tissue secretes a number of vasoactive adipokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and changes to this secretory profile will contribute to pathogenesis in obesity. In this review, we discuss the links between adipokine dysregulation and the development of hypertension and diabetes and explore the potential for manipulating adipose tissue morphology and its immune cell population to improve cardiovascular health in obesity.</p>

<p>RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease (RALD) is a recently described noninfectious and nonmalignant clinical syndrome characterized by autoimmune disorders, massive splenomegaly, modest lymphadenopathy, and monocytosis. On the molecular level, RALD is defined by somatic mutations of either NRAS or KRAS gene in a subset of hematopoietic cells. To date, there is a dearth of well-documented histopathologic description of cutaneous involvement by RALD in the literature. In the current case report, a 43-year-old female patient with a history of RALD presented with clinical pictures of sepsis and an erythematous rash in the left lower extremity. Histologic examination revealed a dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of immature myeloid cells admixed with scattered neutrophils involving the dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue, imparting a panniculitis-like histologic pictures. There was a strong angiocentric propensity of the immature hematopoietic cells as well as extensive extravasation of red blood cells, even in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemically, the immature hematopoietic cells were positive for CD43, CD4, and CD68, but negative for CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase. Overall, the histologic and cytologic findings were highly reminiscent of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. Review of the English literature revealed cutaneous involvements by RALD only in patients with KRAS mutation compared with none of its NRAS counterparts. However, larger clinicopathologic studies on cutaneous involvement by RALD are warranted. The term “RALD cutis” with its histologic and molecular features is suggested to serve as a potential groundwork for future studies of this rare phenomenon.</p>

<p>Arterial hypertension is strongly related to overweight and obesity. In obese subjects, several mechanisms may lead to hypertension such as insulin and leptin resistance, perivascular adipose tissue dysfunction, renal impairment, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system activation and sympathetic nervous system activity. Weight loss (WL) seems to have positive effects on blood pressure (BP). The aim of this review was to explain the mechanisms linking obesity and hypertension and to evaluate the main studies assessing the effect of WL on BP. We analysed studies published in the last 10 years (13 studies either interventional or observational) showing the effect of WL on BP. Different WL strategies were taken into account-diet and lifestyle modification, pharmacological intervention and bariatric surgery. Although a positive effect of WL could be identified in each study, the main difference seems to be the magnitude and the durability of BP reduction over time. Nevertheless, further follow-up data are needed: there is still a lack of evidence about long term effects of WL on hypertension. Hence, given the significant results obtained in several recent studies, weight management should always be pursued in obese patients with hypertension.</p>

<p>Experimental and human autopsy studies have associated adventitial lymphangiogenesis with atherosclerosis. An analysis of perivascular lymphangiogenesis in patients with coronary artery disease is lacking. Here, we examined lymphangiogenesis and its potential regulators in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding the heart (C-PVAT) and compared it with PVAT of the internal mammary artery (IMA-PVAT). Forty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were included. Perioperatively collected C-PVAT and IMA-PVAT were analyzed using histology, immunohistochemistry, real time PCR, and PVAT-conditioned medium using cytokine arrays. C-PVAT exhibited increased PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1)-positive vessel density. The number of lymphatic vessels expressing lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 or podoplanin was also elevated in C-PVAT and associated with higher inflammatory cell numbers, increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, and fibrosis. Significantly higher expression of regulators of lymphangiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF receptor-3 was observed in C-PVAT compared to IMA-PVAT. Cytokine arrays identified angiopoietin-2 as more highly expressed in C-PVAT vs. IMA-PVAT. Findings were confirmed histologically and at the mRNA level. Stimulation of human lymphatic endothelial cells with recombinant angiopoietin-2 in combination with VEGF-C enhanced sprout formation. Our study shows that PVAT surrounding atherosclerotic arteries exhibits more extensive lymphangiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis compared to PVAT surrounding a non-diseased vessel, possibly due to local angiopoietin-2, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D overexpression.</p>

<p>Targeting residual cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention, would allow deployment of novel therapeutic agents, facilitating precision medicine. For example, lowering vascular inflammation is a promising strategy to reduce the residual inflammatory cardiovascular risk in patients already receiving optimal medical therapy, but prescribing novel anti-inflammatory treatments will be problematic due to the lack of specific companion diagnostic tests, to guide their targeted use in clinical practice. Currently available tests for the detection of coronary inflammation are either non-specific for the cardiovascular system (e.g. plasma biomarkers) or expensive and not readily available (e.g. hybrid positron emission tomography imaging). Recent technological advancements in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allow non-invasive detection of high-risk plaque features (positive remodelling, spotty calcification, low attenuation plaque, and napkin-ring sign) and help identify the vulnerable patient, but they provide only indirectly information about coronary inflammation. Perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI), a novel method for assessing coronary inflammation by analysing routine CCTA, captures changes in the perivascular adipose tissue composition driven by inflammatory signals coming from the inflamed coronary artery, by analysing the three-dimensional gradients of perivascular attenuation, followed by adjustments for technical, anatomical, and biological factors. By detecting vascular inflammation, perivascular FAI enhances cardiovascular risk discrimination which could aid more cost-effective deployment of novel therapeutic agents. In this article, we present the existing non-invasive modalities for the detection of coronary inflammation and provide a practical guide for their use in clinical practice.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Mineralocorticoid receptor activation of the epithelial sodium channel in endothelial cells (ECs) (EnNaC) is accompanied by aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated arterial relaxation. Recent data support enhanced activity of the alpha subunit of EnNaC (aEnNaC) mediates this aldosterone induced endothelial stiffening and associated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation. There is mounting evidence that diet induced obesity diminishes expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase a (AMPKa), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which would be expected to lead to impaired downstream eNOS activation. Thereby, we posited that enhanced EnNaC activation contributes to diet induced obesity related increases in stiffness of the endothelium and diminished NO mediated vascular relaxation by increasing oxidative stress and related inhibition of AMPKa, Sirt1, and associated eNOS inactivation.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that endothelial specific EnNaC activation mediates WD-induced endothelial stiffness, impaired eNOS activation, aortic fibrosis and remodeling through increased aortic oxidative stress and increased inflammation related to a reduction of AMPKa and Sirt 1 mediated eNOS phosphorylation/activation and NO production.</p>

<p>Aims Heart failure (HF) is associated with increased large conduit artery stiffness and afterload resulting in stiffening of the coronary arteries. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) both promote arterial stiffness, yet the mechanisms by which coronary PVAT promotes arterial stiffness and the efficacy of exercise to prevent coronary stiffness are unknown. We hypothesized both chronic continuous and interval exercise training would prevent coronary PVAT-mediated AGE secretion and arterial stiffness. Methods and Results Yucatan mininature swine were divided into four groups: control-sedentary (CON), aortic-banded sedentary heart failure (HF), aortic-banded HF continuous exercise trained (HF+CONT), and aortic-banded HF interval exercise trained (HF+IT). The left circumflex (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA) underwent ex vivo mechanical testing, and arterial AGE, elastin and collagen were assessed. Coronary elastin elastic modulus (EEM) and elastin protein were lower, and AGE was increased with HF compared to CON that was prevented by both HF+CONT and HF+IT. Mouse aortic segments treated with swine coronary PVAT-conditioned media had lower EEM, elastin content, greater AGE secretion and arterial AGE accumulation in HF compared with CON, which was prevented by both HF+CONT and HF+IT. Aminoguanidine (AMG), an AGE inhibitor, prevented the reduction in the EEM, arterial elastin content and AGE accumulation in mouse aortic segments treated with PVAT conditioned media in the HF group. Conclusions Our data demonstrate efficacy for chronic continuous and interval exercise to prevent coronary artery stiffness via inhibition of PVAT-derived AGE secretion in a pre-clinical mini-swine model of pressure overload-induced HF.</p>

<p>Human perivascular progenitor cells, including pericytes, are well-described multipotent mesenchymal cells giving rise to mesenchymal stem cells in culture. Despite the unique location of pericytes, specific antigens to distinguish human pericytes from other cell types are few. Here, we employed a human tissue microarray (Human Protein Atlas) to identify proteins strongly and specifically expressed in a pericytic location within human adipose tissue. Next, these results were cross-referenced with RNA sequencing data from human adipose tissue pericytes, as defined as a FAC sorted CD146&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD34&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;CD31&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cell population. Results showed that from 105,532 core biopsies of soft tissue, 229 proteins showed strong and specific perivascular immunoreactivity, the majority of which (155) were present in the tunica intima. Next, cross-referencing with the transcriptome of FACS-derived CD146&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pericytes yielded 25 consistently expressed genes/proteins, including 18 novel antigens. A majority of these transcripts showed maintained expression after culture propagation (56% of genes). Interestingly, many novel antigens within pericytes are regulators of osteogenic differentiation. In sum, our study demonstrates the existence of novel pericyte markers, some of which are conserved in culture that may be useful for future efforts to typify, isolate, and characterize human pericytes.</p>

<p>The purpose of the study was to investigate the features of expression and adiponectin content in the adipocyte culture of subcutaneous, epicardial, and perivascular adipose tissue and the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin on these processes. 29 patients with coronary artery disease were examined. Adipocytes were isolated from the samples of SAT, EAT and PVAT which were taken during coronary artery bypass surgery, followed by cultivation in the presence of rosuvastatin and evaluation of gene expression and adiponectin concentration. Adipocytes SAT, EAT and PVAT differed in the level of adiponectin secretion and expression of its gene. On day 1 of cultivation the expression of the adiponectin gene in the EAT was 2.3 times lower than in the PVAT. On day 2 of cultivation the expression of the adiponectin gene was reduced both in the EAT and the PVAT as compared to the SAT. When rosuvastatin was added at a concentration of 1 mmol/L, adiponectin gene expression in PVAT was higher than when rosuvastatin was added at a concentration of 5 mmol/L, in the adipocyte culture of SAT effect was opposite. Thus, the adipocytes of EZhT and, to a greater extent, PAS, can be a therapeutic target for statins in the case of the pathological activation of adipose tissue.Issledovali osobennosti ékspressii i soderzhaniia adiponektina v kul’ture adipotsitov podkozhnoi, épikardial’noi i perivaskuliarnoi zhirovoi tkani i vliianie na éti protsessy razlichnykh doz rozuvastatina.

<p>Our understanding of the regulation of vascular function, specifically that of vasomotion, has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. The classic conception of a vascular system solely regulated by circulating hormones and sympathetic innervation gave way to a vision of a local regulation. Initially by the so-called, autacoids like prostacyclin, which represented the first endothelium-derived paracrine regulator of smooth muscle. This was the prelude of the EDRF-nitric oxide age that has occupied vascular scientists for nearly 30 years. Endothelial cells revealed to have the ability to generate numerous mediators besides prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). The need to classify these substances led to the coining of the terms: endothelium-derived relaxing, hyperpolarizing and contracting factors, which included various prostaglandins, thromboxane A2, endothelin, as well numerous candidates for the hyperpolarizing factor. The opposite layer of the vascular wall, the adventitia, eventually and for a quite short period of time, enjoyed the attention of some vascular physiologists. Adventitial fibroblasts were recognized as paracrine cells to the smooth muscle because of their ability to produce some substances such as superoxide. Remarkably, this took place before our awareness of the functional potential of another adventitial cell, the adipocyte. Possibly, because the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) was systematically removed during the experiments as considered a non-vascular artifact tissue, it took quite long to be considered a major source of paracrine substances. These are now being integrated in the vast pool of mediators synthesized by adipocytes, known as adipokines. They include hormones involved in metabolic regulation, like leptin or adiponectin; classic vascular mediators like NO, angiotensin II or catecholamines; and inflammatory mediators or adipocytokines. The first substance studied was an anti-contractile factor named adipose-derived relaxing factor of uncertain chemical nature but possibly, some of the relaxing mediators mentioned above are behind this factor. This manuscript intends to review the vascular regulation from the point of view of the paracrine control exerted by the cells present in the vascular environment, namely, endothelial, adventitial, adipocyte and vascular stromal cells.</p>

<p>The duration and distance of manned space flights emphasizes the importance of advanced elucidation of space flight factors and their effects on human beings. The exposure to inflammatory mediators under microgravity may contribute to the activity of different cells, perivascular stromal cells (MSCs) in particular. Inflammatory activation is now considered as a principal cue of MSC engagement in reparative remodeling. In the present paper, the effect of simulated microgravity (sµg) on TNFa-mediated priming of adipose tissue-derived MSC (ASCs) was examined. Sµg per se did not induce inflammatory-related changes, such as elevation of ICAM-1 and HLA-ABC expression, soluble mediator production, or shifting of the transcription profile in ASCs. Moreover, the attenuated ASC response to TNFa priming under sµg was manifested in decreased production of TNFa-dependent pleiotropic cytokines (IL-8 and MCP-1), matrix remodeling proteases, and downregulation of some genes encoding growth factors and cytokines. Time-dependent analysis detected the first signs of priming attenuation after 48<U+2009>hours of 3D-clinorotation. A reduced response of MSCs to priming under sµg can be a negative factor in terms of MSC involvement in tissue remodeling processes.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) could affect PVAT characters, and whether the SGLT2 inhibitors-induced changes of adipose tissue, especially the alternation of adipose tissue-derived secretory factors, affect vascular pathophysiology.METHODS: Western-type diet (WD) fed wild-type mice were treated with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) for 10 weeks. WEHI 274.1 and primary vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated with conditioned media (CM) of epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) or abdominal PVAT of Ipra- or vehicle-treated mice fed a WD. Epi of Ipra- or vehicle-treated mice fed a WD was implanted onto cuff-placed femoral arteries of apoE-deficient mice.RESULTS: Ipra increased adipocyte size associated with decreased expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrosis-related genes in abdominal PVAT of WD-fed mice. Ipra also suppressed WD-induced macrophages accumulation, fibrosis, and adipocyte death in abdominal PVAT. In CM of abdominal PVAT from Ipra-treated mice, concentration of leptin was significantly lower than that from vehicle-treated mice. In vitro, migration of WEHI 274.1 and primary vascular smooth muscle cells were more enhanced by CM of Epi or abdominal PVAT from vehicle-treated mice than that from Ipra-treated mice. Perivascular implantation of Epi from Ipra-treated mice to apolipoprotein E-deficient mice attenuated cuff-induced neointimal hyperplasia and vascular remodeling compared to that from vehicle-treated mice.CONCLUSIONS: The Ipra-induced changes of abdominal PVAT will lead to a better understanding of unveiled mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors prevent cardiovascular complications in T2DM, and the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting PVAT.</p>

<p>The interaction between atherosclerosis and commensal microbes through leaky gut syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by impaired intestinal permeability and the introduction of undesired pathogens into the body, has not been fully elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the potential role of a ClC-2 chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, which is reported to have beneficial effects on LGS, in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. After a 15-week feeding period of a Western diet (WD), ApoE-/- mice were treated with a Western-type diet (WD) alone or WD with oral supplementation of lubiprostone for 10 weeks. This feeding protocol was followed by experimental evaluation of LGS and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. In mice with lubiprostone, in vivo translocation of orally administered 4-kDa FITC-dextran was significantly improved, and RNA expression of the epithelial tight junction proteins, Zo-1 and occludin, was significantly up-regulated in the ileum, compared to the WD alone group, suggesting a possible reversal of WD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. As a result, WD-induced exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation was reduced by 69% in longitudinally opened aortas and 26% in aortic root regions. In addition, there was a significant decrease in circulating immunoglobulin level, followed by an attenuation of inflammatory responses in the perivascular adipose tissue, as evidenced by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lubiprostone attenuates atherosclerosis by ameliorating LGS-induced inflammation through the restoration of the intestinal barrier. These findings raise the possibility of targeting LGS for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the thickness of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and the adipokine-cytokine profile of patients with coronary heart disease, which can be of significant importance for predicting the course of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Eighty-four patients with CVD were assessed and divided into two groups based on the presence of visceral obesity (VO). In patients with VO, the thickness of the epicardial deposits of the left and right ventricles were 1.75 and 1.43 times greater, respectively, than in patients without VO. For patients with VO, the prevalence of the volume of the left anterior descending artery was 10% higher, and the middle third of the envelope artery was 28% higher, when compared to patients without VO. When evaluating inflammatory status, it was established that the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-1ß, and leptin in the blood serum of patients with VO exceeded the values of patients without VO. The level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was 2-times lower in patients with VO. The findings of this study show that increased EAT and PVAT are independent risk factors of CVD, as well as a possible model for the assessment of drug effectiveness for CVD.</p>

<p>KEY POINTS: In vivo, uterine perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) potentiates uterine artery blood flow in pregnant rats, although not in non-pregnant rats. In isolated preparations, uterine PVAT has pro-contractile and anti-dilatory effects on uterine arteries. Pregnancy induces changes in uterine arteries that makes them responsive to uterine PVAT signalling.ABSTRACT: An increase in uterine artery blood flow (UtBF) is a common and necessary feature of a healthy pregnancy. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that adipose tissue surrounding uterine arteries (uterine perivascular adipose tissue; PVAT) is a novel local mediator of UtBF and uterine artery tone during pregnancy. In vivo experiments in anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats showed that pregnant animals (gestational day 16, term = 22–23 days) had a three-fold higher UtBF compared to non-pregnant animals. Surgical removal of uterine PVAT reduced UtBF only in pregnant rats. In a series of ex vivo bioassays, we demonstrated that uterine PVAT had pro-contractile and anti-dilatory effects on rat uterine arteries. In the presence of PVAT-conditioned media, isolated uterine arteries from both pregnant and non-pregnant rats had reduced vasodilatory responses. In non-pregnant rats, these responses were mediated at the level of uterine vascular smooth muscle, whereas, in pregnant rats, PVAT-media reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Pregnancy increased adipocyte size in ovarian adipose tissue but had no effect on uterine PVAT adipocyte morphology. In addition, pregnancy down-regulated the gene expression of metabolic adipokines in uterine but not in aortic PVAT. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that uterine PVAT plays a regulatory role in UtBF, at least in part, as a result of its actions on uterine artery tone. We propose that the interaction between the uterine vascular wall and its adjacent adipose tissue may provide new insights for interventions in pregnancies with adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal UtBF.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Heme oxygenase (HO-1) plays a critical role in adipogenesis and it is important to understand its function in obesity. Many studies have shown that upregulation of HO-1 can affect the biologic parameters in obesity-mediated diabetes, hypertension and vascular endothelial cell function. Thus, we aimed to explore the hypothesis that upregulation of HO-1, using a pharmacologic approach as well as gene targeting, would improve both adiposity and endothelial cell dysfunction by direct targeting of endothelial cells. Our second aim was to compare the short-term effect of a HO-1 inducer, cobalt-protoporphrin IX (CoPP), with the long-term effects of gene targeted therapy on vascular and adipocyte stem cells in obese mice.METHOD: We examined the effect of CoPP on fat pre-adipocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We also used a lentiviral construct that expressed heme oxygenase (HO-1) that was under the control of an endothelium specific promoter, vascular endothelium cadherin (VECAD) heme oxygenase (VECAD-HO-1). We targeted endothelial cells using vascular endothelium cadherin/green fluorescent protein fusion construct (VECAD-GFP) as the control. Conditioned media (CM) from endothelial cells (EC) was added to fat derived adipocytes. Additionally, we treated renal interlobar arteries with phenylephrine and dosed cumulative increments of acetylcholine both with and without exposure to CoPP. We did the same vascular reactivity experiments with VECAD-HO-1 lentiviral construct compared to the control.RESULTS: CoPP improved vascular reactivity and decreased adipogenesis compared to the control. MSCs exposed to CM from EC transfected with VECAD-HO-1 showed decreased adipogenesis, smaller lipid droplet size and decreased PPAR-<U+03B3>, C/EBP and increased Wnt 10b compared to the control. HO-1 upregulation had a direct effect on reducing adipogenesis. This effect was blocked by tin mesoporphrin (SnMP). EC treated with VECAD-HO-1 expressed lower levels of ICAM and VCAM compared to the control, suggesting improved EC function. This also improved ACH induced vascular reactivity. These effects were also reversed by SnMP. The effect of viral transfection was much more specific and sustained than the effects of pharmacologic therapy, CoPP.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a pharmacological inducer of HO-1 such as CoPP improves endothelial cell function while dampening adipogenesis, but long-term HO-1 expression by direct targeting of endothelial cells by gene transfer therapy may offer a more specific and ideal solution. This was evidenced by smaller healthier adipocytes that had improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting increased adiponectin levels. HO-1 upregulation reestablished the “crosstalk” between perivascular adipose tissue and the vascular system that was lost in the chronic inflammatory state of obesity. This study demonstrates that gene targeting of EC may well be the future direction in treating obesity induced EC dysfunction, with the finding that targeting the vasculature had a direct and sustained effect on adipogenesis.</p>

<p>A growing body of evidence is pointing out the pathophysiological role of fat accumulation in different organs. Ectopic fat depots within heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas as well as around blood vessels might be more associated to cardiometabolic risk than classical variables, such as body mass index. Among different mechanisms, lipid metabolism appears to be particularly influenced by ectopic fat depots. Indeed, intracellular accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids, and triglycerides promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial uncoupling, oxidative stress, and altered membrane composition/function, finally promoting inflammatory response and cell death. The dysfunctional adipose tissue was shown to induce both local and systemic effects, with relevant clinical consequences. Epicardial fat and myocardial steatosis have been associated with the development of atrial fibrillation and ventricular dysfunction. Similarly perivascular adipose tissue appears to trigger atherosclerosis and hypertension. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized both as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and as a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. Importantly, the renal sinus fat emerged as a potential player in kidney dysfunction. Finally, both skeletal muscle and pancreatic fat depots have been indicated as potential endocrine modulators of insulin resistance. Considering the global rise in the prevalence of obesity, the understanding of mechanisms underlying ectopic fat accumulation represents an urgent need, with potential clinical implications for CV risk stratification. Here, we attempt to update the current knowledge of the different ectopic fat depots, focusing on underlying mechanisms and potential clinical implications.</p>

<p>Obesity is closely associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, including dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Adipose tissue (AT) is identified as a complex endocrine organ, with a wide range of regulatory functions at the cellular, tissue and systemic levels. Various terms, including paracardiac, epicardial and pericardial, are used to describe the fatty deposits surrounding the heart. Among all the fat depots, perivascular AT (PVAT) is of great biological significance for the cardiovascular system due to its anatomical proximity to the vessels. Recent studies have shown the presence of a complex, bidirectional paracrine and vasocardial signaling system between the vascular wall and PVAT. In the review, we will discuss the biological role of PVAT in both the physiological state and cardiovascular pathology, emphasizing its dual proatherogenic and antiatherogenic role. Let us consider PVAT as a target for various therapeutic agents in cardiovascular diseases. We will also analyze data on the role of non-invasive techniques as a diagnostic tool for assessing coronary artery inflammation.</p>

<p>Aging is an independent risk factor for vascular diseases. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), an active component of the vasculature, contributes to vascular dysfunction during aging. Identification of underlying cell types and their changes during aging may provide meaningful insights regarding the clinical relevance of aging-related vascular diseases. Here, we take advantage of single-cell RNA sequence to characterize the resident stromal cells in the PVAT (PVASCs) and identified different clusters between young and aged PVASCs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed decreased endothelial and brown adipogenic differentiation capacities of PVASCs during aging, which contributed to neointimal hyperplasia after perivascular delivery to ligated carotid arteries. Mechanistically, in vitro and in vivo studies both suggested that aging-induced loss of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> coactivator-1 a (PGC1a) was a key regulator of decreased brown adipogenic differentiation in senescent PVASCs. We further demonstrated the existence of human PVASCs (hPVASCs) and overexpression of PGC1a improved hPVASC delivery-induced vascular remodeling. Our finding emphasizes that differentiation capacities of PVASCs alter during aging and loss of PGC1a in aged PVASCs contributes to vascular remodeling via decreased brown adipogenic differentiation.</p>

<p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) function may depend on its anatomical location and developmental origin. Interscapular BAT (iBAT) regulates acute macronutrient metabolism, whilst perivascular BAT (PVAT) regulates vascular function. Although phenotypically similar, whether these depots respond differently to acute nutrient excess is unclear. Given their distinct anatomical locations and developmental origins and we hypothesised that iBAT and PVAT would respond differently to brief period of nutrient excess. Sprague-Dawley rats aged 12 weeks (n=12) were fed either a standard (10% fat, n=6) or high fat diet (HFD: 45% fat, n=6) for 72h and housed at thermoneutrality. Following an assessment of whole body physiology, fat was collected from both depots for analysis of gene expression and the proteome. HFD consumption for 72h induced rapid weight gain (c. 2.6%) and reduced serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) with no change in either total adipose or depot mass. In iBAT, an upregulation of genes involved in insulin signalling and lipid metabolism was accompanied by enrichment of lipid-related processes and functions, plus glucagon and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathways. In PVAT, HFD induced a pronounced down-regulation of multiple metabolic pathways which was accompanied with increased abundance of proteins involved in apoptosis (e.g. Hdgf and Ywaq) and toll-like receptor signalling (Ube2n). There was also an enrichment of DNA-related processes and functions (e.g. nucleosome assembly and histone exchange) and RNA degradation and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, we show that iBAT and PVAT elicit divergent responses to short-term nutrient excess highlighting early adaptations in these depots before changes in fat mass.</p>

<p>Resveratrol increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells by upregulating the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), stimulating eNOS enzymatic activity, and preventing eNOS uncoupling. At the same time, resveratrol inhibits the synthesis of endothelin-1 and reduces oxidative stress in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Pathological stimuli-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, and arterial stiffness can be ameliorated by resveratrol as well. In addition, resveratrol also modulates immune cell function, inhibition of immune cell infiltration into the vascular wall, and improves the function of perivascular adipose tissue. All these mechanisms contribute to the protective effects of resveratrol on vascular function and blood pressure in vivo. Sirtuin 1, AMP-activated protein kinase, and estrogen receptors represent the major molecules mediating the vascular effects of resveratrol.</p>

<p>Human perivascular stem/stromal cells (PSC) are a multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cell population defined by their perivascular residence. PSC are increasingly studied for their application in skeletal regenerative medicine. PSC from subcutaneous white adipose tissue are most commonly isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and defined as a bipartite population of CD146+CD34-CD31-CD45- pericytes and CD34+CD146-CD31-CD45- adventitial cells. FACS poses several challenges for clinical translation, including requirements for facilities, equipment, and personnel. The purpose of this study is to identify if magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) is a feasible method to derive PSC, and to determine if MACS-derived PSC are comparable to our previous experience with FACS-derived PSC. Briefly, CD146+ pericytes and CD34+ adventitial cells were enriched from human lipoaspirate using a multi-step column approach. Next, cell identity and purity were analyzed by flow cytometry. In vitro multilineage differentiation studies were performed with MACS-defined PSC subsets. Finally, in vivo application was performed in non-healing calvarial bone defects in Scid mice. Results showed that human CD146+ pericytes and CD34+ adventitial cells may be enriched by MACS, with defined purity, anticipated cell surface marker expression, and capacity for multilineage differentiation. In vivo, MACS derived PSC induce ossification of bone defects. These data document the feasibility of a magnetic activated cell sorting approach for the enrichment and application of perivascular stem/stromal cells in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Higher perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes to adverse physiologic alterations in the vascular wall, and thus could potentially limit normal physical function later in life. We hypothesize that higher PVAT volume at midlife is prospectively associated with slower gait speed later in life, independent of overall adiposity and other risk factors.METHODS: Participants from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) cardiovascular fat ancillary study were included. PVAT volume around the descending aorta was quantified using existing CT scans at midlife, while gait speed was measured after an average of 10.4 ± 0.7 years.RESULTS: 276 women (age 51.3±2.8 years at PVAT assessment) were included. Mean gait speed was 0.96 ± 0.21 m/s. Adjusting for study-site, race, education-level, menopausal status, and length of descending aorta at PVAT assessment, and age, body mass index, difficulty paying for basics, overall health and smoking status at gait speed assessment, a higher midlife PVAT volume was associated with a slower gait speed later in life (P=0.03). With further adjustment for presence of any comorbid conditions by the time of gait speed assessment, the association persisted; every 1-SD increase in log-PVAT was associated with 3.3% slower gait speed (95% CI: 0.3%-6.3%; P=0.03).CONCLUSION: Greater PVAT in midlife women may contribute to poorer physical function in older age supporting a potential role of midlife PVAT in multiple domains of healthy aging. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the physiologic changes associated with PVAT that may underlie the observed associations.</p>

<p>Most of the systemic blood vessels are surrounded by the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Healthy PVAT is anticontractile and anti-inflammatory, but a dysfunctional PVAT has been suggested to link cardiometabolic risk factors to vascular dysfunction. Vascular oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological event in cardiometabolic complications of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. PVAT-derived adipocytes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) including superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide that might signal to vascular wall. Therefore, an abnormal generation of ROS by PVAT emerges as a potential pathophysiological mechanism underlying vascular injury. This review summarizes new findings describing ROS production in PVAT of several vascular beds, major sources of ROS in this tissue including mitochondria, NADPH oxidase and eNOS uncoupled, and finally, changes in ROS production affecting vascular function in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Macrophages are linked to the initiation of the chronic inflammation believed to underlie the changes taking place in the white fatty tissue of obese people. Both the number of macrophages, but their functional status, play an important role in the development of inflammation. Classically, macrophages are divided into two types: pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) types, and based on current immunological studies, further views on the functional distribution of macrophages are suggested. In this study, we evaluated the M1 and M2 macrophages ratio in obese subjects with, or without diabetes. To identify all macrophages, we used CD68 expression, while CD204 expression is typically used for the M2 macrophage.MATERIALS AND METHODS: During bariatric surgery, carried out in obese people with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), we obtained subcutaneous adipose tissue from the navel and omental adipose tissue. We also obtained the same tissue from people with a physiological range of BMI from a judicial autopsy. Applying immunohistochemical staining anti-CD68 and anti-CD204, we carried out a quantitative evaluation of the number of macrophages.RESULTS: We found CD68+ and CD204+ positive macrophages in perivascular spaces and between fat cells, both isolated and in larger infiltrates. They were also present in so-called “crown-like structures” (CLS) around dying adipocytes. Quantitative analysis showed an increased number of macrophages in all obese patients compared to the control group of non-obese, individuals without T2D. The most striking observation was the macrophage increase in the visceral fatty tissue of diabetics. The number of CD68 and CD204 positive macrophages was statistically significantly smaller in patients without T2D.CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a significantly greater number of macrophages in visceral adipose tissue, especially in patients with T2D. Our results also show a positive correlation between the presence of T2D and the total number of macrophages; a significantly greater number of macrophages were found in visceral adipose tissue, especially in patients with T2D.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is considered to serve a vital role during the development of endothelial dysfunction. The current study investigated the effect of exosomes derived from mangiferin-stimulated PVAT on endothelial function, including regeneration, migration, apoptosis and inflammation. The number of exosomes secreted by PVAT was increased by stimulation with mangiferin (0.1, 1 or 10 µM), and uptake of these exosomes by endothelial cells was observed. Exosomes produced by stimulation of PVAT with mangiferin reversed the effects of inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction following palmitic acid (PA) treatment. Furthermore, nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B signaling in endothelial cells was significantly increased when treated with PA-induced PVAT-derived exosomes, whereas exosomes from the supernatant of PVAT stimulated with mangiferin reduced p65 and p50 phosphorylation levels in the cells, and inhibited p65 transportation to the nucleus. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that exosomes derived from mangiferin-stimulated PVAT supernatant inhibited inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction via modulation of NF-<U+03BA>B signaling.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding the human coronary arteries, secretes a wide range of adipocytokines affecting the biology of the adjacent vascular wall in a paracrine way. However, we have recently found that PVAT also behaves as a sensor of signals coming from the vascular wall, to which it reacts by changing its morphology and secretory profile. Indeed, vascular inflammation, a key feature of vascular disease pathogenesis, leads to the release of inflammatory signals that disseminate into local fat, inducing local lipolysis and inhibiting adipogenesis. This ability of PVAT to sense inflammatory signals from the vascular wall, can be used as a “thermometer” of the vascular wall, allowing for non-invasive detection of coronary inflammation. Vascular inflammation induces a shift of PVAT’s composition from lipid to aqueous phase, resulting into increased computed tomography (CT) attenuation around the inflamed artery, forming a gradient with increasing attenuation closer to the inflamed coronary artery wall. These spatial changes in PVAT’s attenuation are easily detected around culprit lesions during acute coronary syndromes. A new biomarker designed to captured these spatial changes in PVAT’s attenuation around the human coronary arteries, the Fat Attenuation Index (FAI), has additional predictive value in stable patients for cardiac mortality and non-fatal heart attacks, above the prediction provided by the current state of the art that includes risk factors, calcium score and presence of high risk plaque features. The use of perivascular FAI in clinical practice may change the way we interpret cardiovascular CT angiography, as it is applicable to any coronary CT angiogram, and it offers dynamic information about the inflammatory burden of the coronary arteries, providing potential guidance for preventive measures and invasive treatments.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the state of the art on the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in the microcirculation of patients with obesity, focusing on the complex relationship between the consolidated and the novel mechanisms involved in this alteration.RECENT FINDINGS: Human obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, caused by a reduced nitric oxide availability secondary to an enhanced oxidative stress production. Pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, secreted by perivascular adipose tissue, is a major mechanism whereby obesity is associated with a reduced vascular NO availability. Vasculature also represents a source of low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress which contribute to endothelial dysfunction in obese patients. Recently, a direct influence of arginase on endothelial function by reducing nitric oxide availability was demonstrated in small vessels from patients with severe obesity. This effect is modulated by ageing and related to the high levels of vascular oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and enzymatic pathways are important players in the pathophysiology of obesity-related vascular disease. The identification of new therapeutic approaches able to interfere with these mechanisms will result in more effective prevention of the cardiovascular complications associated with obesity.</p>

<p>Obesity has many deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, mediated by changes in insulin sensitivity, dyslipidaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. Current therapies mainly focus on caloric intake suppression and bariatric surgery, however the efficacy of these approaches remains elusive as most patients regain their body weight within the next 5<U+202F>years. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity is of paramount importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent vascular complications. Autophagy has emerged as key self-degrading process responsible for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Defects in autophagy homeostasis are implicated in metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Most importantly, autophagy regulates animal lifespan. Albeit ample preclinical evidence supports the therapeutic promise of autophagy modulators for the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases, the clinical efficacy of pharmacological modulation of autophagy remains to be proven. Recent work has shown that GLP-1-based therapeutic approaches may positively affect autophagy in perivascular adipose tissue, thus improving obesity-related endothelial dysfunction. In the present review we discuss current evidence on the role of autophagy in obesity, with a specific focus on DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) as modulators of this process. Experimental evidence on GLP-1-based approaches is critically discussed in light of recent clinical trials with DPP-4i and GLP-1 RA.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is a rich source of multi-potent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) capable of differentiating into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Adipogenic differentiation of progenitor cells is a major mechanism driving adipose tissue expansion and dysfunction in response to obesity. Understanding changes to perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is thus clinically relevant in metabolic disease. However, previous studies have been predominately performed in the mouse and other animal models. This protocol uses human thoracic PVAT samples collected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Adipose tissue from the ascending aorta was collected and used for explantation of the stromal vascular fraction. We previously confirmed the presence of adipose progenitor cells in human PVAT with the capacity to differentiate into lipid-containing adipocytes. In this study, we further analyzed the differentiation potential of cells from the stromal vascular fraction, presumably containing multi-potent progenitor cells. We compared PVAT-derived cells to human bone marrow MSC for differentiation into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Following 14 days of differentiation, specific stains were utilized to detect lipid accumulation in adipocytes (Oil red O), calcific deposits in osteogenic cells (Alizarin Red), or glycosaminoglycans and collagen in chondrogenic cells (Masson’s Trichrome). While bone marrow MSC efficiently differentiated into all three lineages, PVAT-derived cells had adipogenic and chondrogenic potential, but lacked robust osteogenic potential.</p>

<p>Hypertension (HT) is a global public health issue. There are many behavioural risk factors including unhealthy diet, tobacco use and alcohol consumption as well physical inactivity that contribute to the development of high blood pressure (BP) and its complications. Favourable effect of regular physical activity on treatment or prevention of hypertension by improvement of endothelial function is widely accepted however little is known about its relationship with immune system. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the role of moderate regular physical activity on immune cell phenotype. T cell and monocyte subsets were characterised in 31 subjects with prehypertension (130 - 139 mmHg systolic and 85 - 89 mmHg diastolic blood pressure) who participated in moderate training (3 times/week) on cyclometers for 3 months in crossover study design. Complementary study was performed in murine model of Ang II-induced hypertension and ten-week-old animals were trained on a treadmill (5 times/week, 1 hour) for 2 weeks before and 1.5 weeks after minipumps implantation. In the context of elevated blood pressure regular physical activity had modest influence on immune cell phenotype. Both in human study and murine model we did not observe effects of applied exercise that can explain the mechanism of BP reduction after short-term regular training. Twelve-weeks regular training did not affect the activation status of T lymphocytes measured as expression of CD69, CD25 and CCR5 in human study. Physical activity resulted in higher expression of adhesion molecule CD11c on CD16+ monocytes (especially CD14 high) without any changes in leukocytes subpopulation counts. Similar results were observed in murine model of hypertension after the training. However the training caused significant decrease of CCR5 and CD25 expressions (measured as a mean fluorescence intensity) on CD8+ T cells infiltrating perivascular adipose tissue. Our studies show modest regulatory influence of moderate training on inflammatory markers in prehypertensive subjects and murine model of Ang II induced hypertension.</p>

<p>Angiotensin II plays important functions in cardiovascular system mediating actions leading to inflammatory responses such as activation of VSMC in order to produce ROS, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Changes in angiotensin II production could stimulate the recruitment and activation of myeloid cells initiating local inflammatory response without effect on BP. We aimed to verify if angiotensin II induces an inflammatory response in the aorta and if it correlates with variations in BP. C57Bl/6 mice treated with saline solution (0.9%, control group) or angiotensin II (30ng/kg, Ang II group) were used. BP and HR levels were measured. Immunohistochemistry for IL1-<i>ß</i>, TGF-<i>ß</i>, iNOS, CD45, and <i>a</i>-actin was performed in the aorta. BP and HR do not change. A biphasic response was observed both for IL1-<i>ß</i> and TGF-<i>ß</i> expression and also for the presence of CD45 positive cells, with an acute increase (between 30 and 60 minutes) and a second increase, between 24 and 48 hours. Positive staining for iNOS increased in the earlier period (30 minutes) in perivascular adipose tissue and in a longer period (48 hours) in tunica adventitia. Immunoblotting to <i>a</i>-actin showed no alterations, suggesting that the applied dose of angiotensin II does not alter the aortic VSMCs phenotype. The results suggest that angiotensin II, even at doses that do not alter BP, induces the expression of inflammatory markers and migration of inflammatory cells into the aorta of normotensive mice. Thus, angiotensin II may increase the propensity to develop a cardiovascular injury, even in normotensive individuals.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and its vasomodulatory effects play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of blood vessels. Alterations in PVAT associated with reduction in its anticontractile influence are proven to contribute to vascular dysfunction in hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine whether the changes in PVAT properties could participate in progression of vascular abnormalities in developing spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR, both in 5th and in 12th week of age, were used. Systolic blood pressure was similar between WKY rats and SHR in 5th week of age; however, in 12th week, it was significantly increased in SHR comparing to WKY rats. The amount of retroperitoneal fat was higher in WKY rats in both age groups, whereas body weight was higher in WKY rats only in 12th week, when compared to age-matched SHR. From isolated superior mesenteric arteries, two ring preparations were prepared for isometric tension recording, one with PVAT intact and other with PVAT removed. In WKY rats as well as in SHR, arterial contractile responses to noradrenaline, applied cumulatively on rings, were significantly inhibited in the presence of intact PVAT. In both age groups, anticontractile effect of PVAT was higher in WKY rats than in SHR. Neurogenic contractions, induced by electrical stimulation of perivascular sympathoadrenergic nerves, were significantly attenuated in the presence of PVAT in WKY mesenteric arteries from both age groups; however, in arteries from SHR, intact PVAT had no influence on this type of contractile responses. The results suggest that in SHR impairment of anticontractile effect of PVAT precedes hypertension and might contribute to its development.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVEStem cell therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of severe cerebral ischemia. However, targeting sufficient grafted cells to the affected area remains challenging. Choosing an adequate transplantation method for the CNS appears crucial for this therapy to become a clinical reality. The authors used a scaffold-free cell sheet as a translational intervention. This method involves the use of cell sheet layers and allows the transplantation of a large number of cells, locally and noninvasively. The authors evaluated the effectiveness of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell sheets in a rat model of stroke.METHODSThe animals, subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, were randomly divided in two groups: one in which a cell sheet was transplanted and the other in which a vehicle was used (n = 10/group). Over a period of 14 days after transplantation, the animals’ behavior was evaluated, after which brain tissue samples were removed and fixed, and the extent of angiogenesis and infarct areas was evaluated histologically.RESULTSCompared to the vehicle group, in the cell sheet group functional angiogenesis and neurogenesis were significantly increased, which resulted in behavioral improvement. Transplanted cells were identified within newly formed perivascular walls as pericytes, a proportion of which were functional. Newly formed blood vessels were found within the cell sheet that had anastomosed to the cerebral blood vessels in the host.CONCLUSIONSThe transplantation approach described here is expected to provide not only a paracrine effect but also a direct cell effect resulting in cell replacement that protects the damaged neurovascular unit. The behavioral improvement seen with this transplantation approach provides the basis for further research on cell sheet-based regenerative treatment as a translational treatment for patients with stroke.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence shows that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is crucially involved in inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. However, controversial results have been reported regarding the effect of PVAT in atherosclerosis. This study aimed to determine the role of PVAT in disturbed blood flow (d-flow)-induced carotid plaque formation.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that regulated PVAT formation may confer protection against atherosclerosis-prone shear stress, probably through attenuation of focal inflammation.</p>

<p>Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a complex and multifactorial chronic disease. Our aim was to assess the associations between obesity, fat depots and carotid artery stenosis (CAS) in patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk.METHODS: The study group included 391 patients (F/M: 136/255 pts.; age: 61.8<U+202F>±<U+202F>8<U+202F>years) scheduled for elective coronary angiography. A comprehensive clinical assessment included a carotid artery and abdominal ultrasound involving the following fat depots: (1) carotid extra-media thickness (EMT) indexed to the body mass index (perivascular adipose tissue [PVAT]), and (2) abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat.RESULTS: Patients with a =50% stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA) were older (65.9<U+202F>±<U+202F>7 vs 60.3<U+202F>±<U+202F>7<U+202F>years, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.0001) and had increased PVAT (836<U+202F>±<U+202F>120 vs 779<U+202F>±<U+202F>127<U+202F>µm, p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.01) compared to individuals with &lt;50% internal carotid artery stenosis. None of the CAS parameters were associated with any measures of obesity. Multivariable regression model showed that age (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.0001), PVAT (p<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.0001) and smoking (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.04) were independently associated with the severity of ICA stenosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that carotid extra-media thickness, an index measure of PVAT, is associated with CAS severity. It is a strong and independent predictor of significant ICA stenosis. None of the obesity measurements revealed associations with carotid atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is no longer recognised as simply a structural support for the vasculature, and we now know that PVAT releases vasoactive factors which modulate vascular function. Since the discovery of this function in 1991, PVAT research is rapidly growing and the importance of PVAT function in disease is becoming increasingly clear. Obesity is associated with a plethora of vascular conditions; therefore, the study of adipocytes and their effects on the vasculature is vital. PVAT contains an adrenergic system including nerves, adrenoceptors and transporters. In obesity, the autonomic nervous system is dysfunctional; therefore, sympathetic innervation of PVAT may be the key mechanistic link between increased adiposity and vascular disease. In addition, not all obese people develop vascular disease, but a common feature amongst those that do appears to be the inflammatory cell population in PVAT. This review will discuss what is known about sympathetic innervation of PVAT, and the links between nerve activation and inflammation in obesity. In addition, we will examine the therapeutic potential of exercise in sympathetic stimulation of adipose tissue.</p>

<p>KEY POINTS: The prevailing dogma about neurogenic regulation of vascular tone consists of major vasodilatation caused by CGRP (and possibly substance P) released from sensory-motor nerves and vasoconstriction caused by noradrenaline, ATP and neuropeptode Y release from sympathetic nerves. Most studies on perivascular nerve-mediated vasodilatation are made in vitro. In the present study, we provide evidence indicating that in vivo electrical perivascular nerve stimulation in rat mesenteric small arteries causes a large ß1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, which contrasts with a smaller vasodilatation caused by endogenous CGRP that is only visible after inhibition of Y1 NPY receptors.</p>

<p>Background Perivascular adipose tissue ( PVAT ) is causally associated with vascular function and the pathogenesis of vascular disease in association with metabolically driven chronic inflammation called metaflammation. However, the difference in PVAT surrounding the coronary artery ( CA - PVAT ) and that surrounding the internal thoracic artery (ITA-PVAT), a vessel resistant to atherosclerosis, remains unclear. Herein, we investigated whether CA - PVAT , ITA - PVAT , and subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SCAT ) have distinct phenotypes. Methods and Results Fat pads were sampled from 44 patients (men/women, 36:8; age, 67±13 years) with CA disease who underwent elective CA bypass grafting. Adipocyte size in ITA - PVAT and that in CA - PVAT were significantly smaller than that in SCAT . A greater extent of fibrosis and increased gene expression levels of fibrosis-related molecules were observed in CA - PVAT than those in SCAT and those in ITA - PVAT . CA - PVAT exhibited more pronounced metaflammation, as indicated by a significantly larger extent of CD 68-positive and CD 11c-positive M1 macrophages, a lower ratio of CD 206-positive M2 to CD 11c-positive M1 macrophages, a lower gene expression level of adiponectin, and higher gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome- and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related molecules, than did ITA - PVAT and SCAT . Expression patterns of adipocyte developmental and pattern-forming genes were totally different among SCAT , ITA - PVAT, and CA - PVAT . Conclusions The phenotype of ITA - PVAT is closer to that of SCAT than that of CA - PVAT , which may result from inherent differences in adipocytes. ITA - PVAT appears to be protected from metaflammation and consecutive adipose tissue remodeling, which may contribute to the decreased atherosclerotic plaque burden in the ITA.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction are associated with obesity. Studies in obese patients and animals demonstrate that the MR (mineralocorticoid receptor) contributes to obesity-associated cardiovascular complications through its specific role in AT. However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate whether MR regulates mitochondrial function in obesity, resulting in AT premature aging and vascular dysfunction. Obese (db/db) and lean (db/+) mice were treated with an MR antagonist or a specific mitochondria-targeted antioxidant. Mitochondrial and vascular functions were determined by respirometry and myography, respectively. Molecular mechanisms were probed by Western immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction in visceral AT and arteries and focused on senescence markers and redox-sensitive pathways. db/db mice displayed AT senescence with activation of the p53-p21 pathway and decreased SIRT (sirtuin) levels, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the beneficial anticontractile effects of perivascular AT were lost in db/db via ROCK (Rho kinase) activation. MR blockade prevented these effects. Thus, MR activation in obesity induces mitochondrial dysfunction and AT senescence and dysfunction, which consequently increases vascular contractility. In conclusion, our study identifies novel mechanistic insights involving MR, adipose mitochondria, and vascular function that may be of importance to develop new therapeutic strategies to limit obesity-associated cardiovascular complications.</p>

<p>The Global Burden of Disease Study identified cardiovascular risk factors as leading causes of global deaths and life years lost. Endothelial dysfunction represents a pathomechanism that is associated with most of these risk factors and stressors, and represents an early (subclinical) marker/predictor of atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress is a trigger of endothelial dysfunction and it is a hall-mark of cardiovascular diseases and of the risk factors/stressors that are responsible for their initiation. Endothelial function is largely based on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function and activity. Likewise, oxidative stress can lead to the loss of eNOS activity or even “uncoupling” of the enzyme by adverse regulation of well-defined “redox switches” in eNOS itself or up-/down-stream signaling molecules. Of note, not only eNOS function and activity in the endothelium are essential for vascular integrity and homeostasis, but also eNOS in perivascular adipose tissue plays an important role for these processes. Accordingly, eNOS protein represents an attractive therapeutic target that, so far, was not pharmacologically exploited. With our present work, we want to provide an overview on recent advances and future therapeutic strategies that could be used to target eNOS activity and function in cardiovascular (and other) diseases, including life style changes and epigenetic modulations. We highlight the redox-regulatory mechanisms in eNOS function and up- and down-stream signaling pathways (e.g., tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism and soluble guanylyl cyclase/cGMP pathway) and their potential pharmacological exploitation.</p>

It is well described that PVAT is an important modulator of the vascular tone being considered a biologically active tissue, releasing both vasoconstrictor and vasodilators factors.

<p>BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease in aging societies, which is accompanied by chronic inflammation and degeneration of the joint structure. Inflammation of the infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) and synovial membrane (IFP surface) plays essential roles in persistent pain development in patients with OA. To identify the point during the inflammatory process critical for persistent pain development, we performed a time course histological analysis in a rat arthritis model.METHODS: Wistar rats received single intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetic acid (MIA, 0.2 or 1.0<U+2009>mg/30<U+2009>µL) in the right knees or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 30<U+2009>µL) as a control in the left knees. Pain avoidance behaviors (weight-bearing asymmetry and tactile hypersensitivity of the plantar surface of the hind paw) were evaluated on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 after injection. Histological assessments of the knee joint were performed on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 after MIA injection.RESULTS: Weight-bearing asymmetry was observed along with the onset of acute inflammation in both the low- (0.2<U+2009>mg) and high-dose (1.0<U+2009>mg) groups. In the low-dose group, weight-bearing asymmetry was completely reversed on day 10, indicating that joint pain seemed to alleviate between days 7 and 10. In contrast, we observed persistent joint pain after day 10 in the high-dose group. Histological assessments of the high-dose group indicated that the initial sign of inflammatory responses was observed in the perivascular region inside the IFP. Inflammatory cell infiltration from the perivascular region to the parenchymal region of the IFP was observed on day 3 and reached the IFP surface (synovial membrane) on day 7. Extensive fibrosis throughout the IFP was observed between days 5 and 7 after MIA injection.CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that acute joint pain occurs along with the onset of acute inflammatory process. Irreversible structural changes in the IFP, such as extensive fibrosis, are observed prior to persistent pain development. Thus, we consider that this process may play important roles in persistent pain development.</p>

<p>RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease (RALD) is a recently described noninfectious and nonmalignant clinical syndrome characterized by autoimmune disorders, massive splenomegaly, modest lymphadenopathy, and monocytosis. On the molecular level, RALD is defined by somatic mutations of either NRAS or KRAS gene in a subset of hematopoietic cells. To date, there is a dearth of well-documented histopathologic description of cutaneous involvement by RALD in the literature. In the current case report, a 43-year-old female patient with a history of RALD presented with clinical pictures of sepsis and an erythematous rash in the left lower extremity. Histologic examination revealed a dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of immature myeloid cells admixed with scattered neutrophils involving the dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue, imparting a panniculitis-like histologic pictures. There was a strong angiocentric propensity of the immature hematopoietic cells as well as extensive extravasation of red blood cells, even in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemically, the immature hematopoietic cells were positive for CD43, CD4, and CD68, but negative for CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase. Overall, the histologic and cytologic findings were highly reminiscent of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. Review of the English literature revealed cutaneous involvements by RALD only in patients with KRAS mutation compared with none of its NRAS counterparts. However, larger clinicopathologic studies on cutaneous involvement by RALD are warranted. The term “RALD cutis” with its histologic and molecular features is suggested to serve as a potential groundwork for future studies of this rare phenomenon.</p>

<p>Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is thought to play a role in vascular homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of large vessel diseases, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Herein, we tested the hypothesis that locally restricted transcriptional profiles characterize PVAT surrounding AAA, indicating specific dysfunctions associated with the disease. Approach and Results- Using a paired sample design to limit the effects of interindividual variation, we performed a microarray-based investigation of the PVAT transcriptome in 30 patients with AAA, comparing the adipose layer of the dilated abdominal aorta with that of the not-dilated aortic neck in each patient. Furthermore, we used a state-of-the-art data mining procedure to remove the effect of confounders produced by high-throughput gene expression techniques. We found substantial differences in PVAT gene expression clearly distinguishing the dilated from the not-dilated aorta, which increased in number and magnitude with increasing AAA diameter. Comparisons with other adipose depots (omental or subcutaneous fat) confirmed that gene expression changes are locally restricted. We dissected putative mechanisms associated with AAA PVAT dysfunction through a functional enrichment network analysis: both innate and adaptive immune-response genes along with genes related to cell-death pathways, metabolic processes of collagen, sphingolipids, aminoglycans, and extracellular matrix degradation were strongly overrepresented in PVAT of AAA compared with PVAT of the not-dilated aorta. Conclusions- Our results support a possible function of PVAT in AAA pathogenesis and suggest that AAA is an immunologic disease with an underlying autoimmune component. Interfering with these disease-specific pathways would clarify their precise role in AAA pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contains an independent adrenergic system that can take up, metabolize, release, and potentially synthesize the vasoactive catecholamine norepinephrine. Norepinephrine has been detected in PVAT, but the mechanism of its protection within this tissue is unknown. Here, we investigate whether PVAT adipocytes can store norepinephrine using VMAT (vesicular monoamine transporter). Approach and Results- High-performance liquid chromatography identified norepinephrine in normal male Sprague Dawley rat aortic, superior mesenteric artery, and mesenteric resistance vessel PVATs, and retroperitoneal fat. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed VMAT1 and VMAT2 mRNA expression in the adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction of mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of VMAT1 and VMAT2, and the colocalization of VMAT2 with norepinephrine, in the cytoplasm of adipocytes in mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT. A protocol was developed to capture real-time uptake of Mini 202-a functional and fluorescent VMAT probe-in live rat PVAT adipocytes. Mini 202 was taken up by freshly isolated and differentiated adipocytes from mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT and adipocytes from thoracic aortic and superior mesenteric artery PVATs. In adipocytes freshly isolated from mesenteric resistance vessel PVAT, addition of rose bengal (VMAT inhibitor), nisoxetine (norepinephrine transporter inhibitor), or corticosterone (organic cation 3 transporter inhibitor) significantly reduced Mini 202 signal. Immunofluorescence supports that neither VMAT1 nor VMAT2 is present in retroperitoneal adipocytes, suggesting that PVAT adipocytes may be unique in storing norepinephrine. Conclusions- This study supports a novel function of PVAT adipocytes in storing amines in a VMAT-dependent manner. It provides a foundation for future studies exploring the purpose and mechanisms of norepinephrine storage by PVAT in normal physiology and obesity-related hypertension.</p>

<p>Background Studies have shown that pericoronary artery inflammation can be accurately detected via increased attenuation on computed tomography. Our purpose was to evaluate the association between pericarotid inflammation, measured by density of carotid perivascular fat on computed tomography angiography, with stroke and transient ischemic attack. Methods and Results We screened computed tomography angiography examinations for patients with unilateral internal carotid artery ( ICA ) stenosis =50% to 99%. A blinded neuroradiologist placed regions-of-interest in the pericarotid fat on the slice showing maximal stenosis. Two-sample t tests were performed to assess between-subject differences in mean Hounsfield Units in carotid perivascular fat between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Paired t tests were used to assess within-subject differences in mean Hounsfield Units between stenotic versus nonstenotic ICA s in a given patient. We included 94 patients, including 42 symptomatic and 52 asymptomatic patients. In the between-subject analysis of stenotic ICA s, we found symptomatic patients had higher mean pericarotid fat density compared with asymptomatic patients (-66.2±19.2 versus -77.1±20.4, P=0.009). When comparing nonstenotic ICA s, there was no significant difference between pericarotid fat density in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients (-81.0±13.3 versus -85.3±18.0: P=0.198). Within-subject comparison showed statistically significant increased density in stenotic ICA versus nonstenotic ICA with mean Hounsfield Units difference of 11.1 ( P&lt;0.0001). Conclusions We found increased density, a surrogate marker for perivascular inflammation, in the fat surrounding ICA s ipsilateral to stroke or transient ischemic attack compared with asymptomatic ICA s. Our findings suggest that inflammation associated with culprit carotid plaques extends beyond the vessel lumen and can be identified using simple methods on computed tomography angiography imaging.</p>

<p>Although pericytes have long been known for their roles in blood vessel regulation, it was not until a decade ago that their tissue regeneration potential began to be considered, after studies showed that pericytes were the in vivo counterparts of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). The prospective isolation and culture expansion of pericytes brought great excitement as it opened the way to the therapeutic use of well-defined cell populations with known regenerative potential to overcome concerns associated with the use of traditional MSC preparations. Studies first in humans and later in the horse and other domestic species showed that indeed cultured pericytes had key characteristics of MSCs, namely, their immunophenotype and the abilities to grow clonally and to differentiate into mature mesenchymal cells both in vitro and vivo. Several studies with human pericytes, and to a much lesser extent with animal pericytes, have also shown significant promise in tissue repair in different disease models. This review summarizes current knowledge on the tissue regeneration properties of pericytes from domestic animals and outlines future steps necessary for realizing their full potential both in clinical veterinary medicine and in preclinical testing of human therapies using large animal models, including the need for robust approaches for isolation, culture and appropriate in vivo testing of the tissue regenerative properties of pericytes in these species.</p>

<p>Besides seminal functions in angiogenesis and blood pressure regulation, microvascular pericytes possess a latent tissue regenerative potential that can be revealed in culture following transition into mesenchymal stem cells. Endowed with robust osteogenic potential, pericytes and other related perivascular cells extracted from adipose tissue represent a potent and abundant cell source for refined bone tissue engineering and improved cell therapies of fractures and other bone defects. The use of diverse bone formation assays in vivo, which include mouse muscle pocket osteogenesis and calvaria replenishment, rat and dog spine fusion, and rat non-union fracture healing, has confirmed the superiority of purified perivascular cells for skeletal (re)generation. As a surprising observation though, despite strong endogenous bone-forming potential, perivascular cells drive bone regeneration essentially indirectly, via recruitment by secreted factors of local osteo-progenitors.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is not only a connective tissue but also an endocrine organ secreting adipokines like Leptin and Adiponectin, lipokines such as palmitoileic acid and extracellular vesicles. These factors and the expression of matrix remodeling enzymes impact surrounding tissues via paracrine effects. The expression of selected secretion factors and the effect of adipocyte conditioned media from four thoracal adipose tissue origins - subcutaneous, perivascular, pericardial and epicardial adipose tissues - in a fibroblast proliferation/wound healing scratch assay model were investigated. Results were compared directly and according to the type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) status of the patients the tissues are originated from. Adipocyte conditioned media from non-diabetic patients resulted in a significant higher scratch closure rate compared to the media with T2DM background. Linoleic acid incubation in scratch assay resulted in a reduced scratch closure rate. Leptin, Adiponectin and Visfatin/Nampt expression and MMP2, MMP9 and FSTL1 mRNA levels did not vary according to T2DM subgroups directly, leading to the assumption that these factors are not causal for scratch assay effects observed. In contrast significant mRNA expression differences were monitored between the thoracal tissue origins implying variations in the local effects of the different adipose tissue depots.</p>

<p>Intravascular photoacoustic-ultrasound (IVPA-US) imaging and near-infrared spectroscopy-intravascular ultrasound (NIRS-IVUS) are two hybrid modalities that detect arterial lipid, with comparison necessary to understand the relative advantages of each. We performed in vivo and ex vivo IVPA-US imaging of the iliac arteries of Ossabaw swine with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and lean swine to investigate sensitivity for early-stage atherosclerosis. We repeated imaging ex vivo with NIRS-IVUS for comparison to IVPA-US and histology. Both modalities showed significantly greater lipid in MetS vs. lean swine, but only IVPA-US localized the lipid as perivascular. To investigate late-stage atherosclerosis, we performed ex vivo IVPA-US imaging of a human coronary artery with comparison to NIRS-IVUS and histology. Two advanced fibroatheromas were identified, with agreement between IVPA-measured lipid area and NIRS-derived lipid content. As confirmed histologically, IVPA-US has sensitivity to detect lipid content similar to NIRS-IVUS and provides additional depth resolution, enabling quantification and localization of lipid cores within plaques.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with various human disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cancers. In this study, we observed that knockout (KO) of CCN5, which encodes a matricellular protein, caused mild obesity in mice. The CCN5 KO mice also exhibited mild diabetes characterized by high fasting glucose levels and impaired insulin and glucose tolerances. Cardiac hypertrophy, ectopic lipid accumulation, and impaired lipid metabolism in hearts were observed in the CCN5 KO mice, as determined using histology, quantitative RT-PCR, and western blotting. Fibrosis was significantly greater in hearts from the CCN5 KO mice both in interstitial and perivascular regions, which was accompanied by higher expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Both systolic and diastolic functions were significantly impaired in hearts from the CCN5 KO mice, as assessed using echocardiography. Taken together, these results indicate that CCN5 KO leads to lipotoxic cardiomyopathy with mild obesity and diabetes in mice.</p>

<p>The seeding of scaffolds with the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue is a common prevascularization strategy in tissue engineering. Alternatively, adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments (ad-MVF) may serve as vascularization units. In contrast to SVF single cells, they represent a mixture of intact arteriolar, capillary and venular vessel segments. Therefore, we herein hypothesized that the ad-MVF-based prevascularization of scaffolds is superior to the conventional SVF single cells-based approach.</AbstractText>: The seeding of scaffolds with the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue is a common prevascularization strategy in tissue engineering.

In contrast to SVF single cells, they represent a mixture of intact arteriolar, capillary and venular vessel segments. Therefore, we herein hypothesized that the ad-MVF-based prevascularization of scaffolds is superior to the conventional SVF single cells-based approach.SVF single cells and ad-MVF were enzymatically isolated from epididymal fat pads of green fluorescent protein (GFP)<sup>+</sup> donor mice to assess their viability and cellular composition using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Moreover, collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices (Integra®) were seeded with identical amounts of the isolates and implanted into full-thickness skin defects within dorsal skinfold chambers of GFP<sup>-</sup> recipient mice for the intravital fluorescent microscopic, histological and immunohistochemical analysis of implant vascularization and incorporation throughout an observation period of 2 weeks. Non-seeded matrices served as controls. While both isolates contained a comparable fraction of endothelial cells, perivascular cells, adipocytes and stem cells, ad-MVF exhibited a significantly higher viability. After in vivo implantation, the vascularization of ad-MVF-seeded scaffolds was improved when compared to SVF-seeded ones, as indicated by a significantly higher functional microvessel density. This was associated with an enhanced cellular infiltration, collagen content and density of CD31<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>+</sup> microvessels particularly in the center of the implants, demonstrating a better incorporation into the surrounding host tissue. In contrast, non-seeded matrices exhibited a poor vascularization, incorporation and epithelialization over time.</AbstractText>: microvessels particularly in the center of the implants, demonstrating a better incorporation into the surrounding host tissue.

<p>Adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments (ad-MVFs) are promising vascularization units for tissue engineering. In this study, we analysed the effects of normothermic (37°C) and subnormothermic (20°C) short-term cultivation on their viability and network forming capacity. Ad-MVFs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> C57BL/6 mice were cultivated for 24 hr at 37°C or 20°C. Freshly isolated, noncultivated ad-MVFs served as controls. Number, length, viability, proliferation, and angiogenic activity of the ad-MVFs were assessed by microscopic analysis and proteome profiling. GFP<sup>+</sup> ad-MVFs were seeded onto collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices, which were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of GFP<sup>-</sup> mice to analyse their vascularization by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Depending on the temperature, short-term cultivation of ad-MVFs markedly changed their expression of multiple proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. Moreover, cultivation at 37°C significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells within ad-MVFs, whereas 20°C preserved the viability of ad-MVFs and even promoted the proliferation of endothelial and perivascular cells. Accordingly, ad-MVFs cultivated at 20°C also exhibited an enhanced in vivo vascularization capacity when compared with normothermically cultivated ad-MVFs and noncultivated controls. This was indicated by an accelerated network formation, an increased microvascular remodelling, and a higher density of GFP<sup>+</sup> microvessels within implanted matrices. Thus, if ad-MVFs require short-term storage before in vivo application, subnormothermic cultivation should be preferred to normothermic cultivation.</p>

<p>Thoracic aorta perivascular adipose tissue (T-PVAT) has critical roles in regulating vascular homeostasis. However, the developmental characteristics and cellular lineage of adipocyte in the T-PVAT remain unclear. We show that T-PVAT contains three long strip-shaped fat depots, anterior T-PVAT (A-T-PVAT), left lateral T-PVAT (LL-T-PVAT), and right lateral T-PVAT (RL-T-PVAT). A-T-PVAT displays a distinct transcriptional profile and developmental origin compared to the two lateral T-PVATs (L-T-PVAT). Lineage tracing studies indicate that A-T-PVAT adipocytes are primarily derived from SM22a<sup>+</sup> progenitors, whereas L-T-PVAT contains both SM22a<sup>+</sup> and Myf5<sup>+</sup> cells. We also show that L-T-PVAT contains more UCP1<sup>+</sup> brown adipocytes than A-T-PVAT, and L-T-PVAT exerts a greater relaxing effect on aorta than A-T-PVAT. Angiotensin II-infused hypertensive mice display greater macrophage infiltration into A-T-PVAT than L-T-PVAT. These combined results indicate that L-T-PVAT has a distinct development from A-T-PVAT with different cellular lineage, and suggest that L-T-PVAT and A-T-PVAT have different physiological and pathological functions.</p>

Methods and Results: The pathological and physiological functions of human SVGs with a NT technique to preserve the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and ones obtained by using a conventional (CON) technique removing PVAT, were examined. Immunohistochemistry of the section of SVGs showed that the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the endothelium of the NT group was more responsive to vascular endothelial growth factor. A myograph of SVGs showed greater contraction with phenylephrine in the NT group. However, the strong contraction was eliminated in SVGs taken by electrocautery. In the 10 patients whose SVGs were taken without electrocautery, endothelial-dependent relaxation with bradykinin was apparently increased in the CON group more than in the NT group. Smooth muscle relaxation with nitroprusside was higher in the CON group at the lower concentrations; however, the relaxation became greater in the NT group at the high concentrations. Therefore, the effect of neutralizing PVAT-released factors in the both groups was further examined. After medium of NT and CON were exchanged in half, relaxation of SVGs was immediately restored in the NT group.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the NT technique preserves the functions of vasoconstriction and relaxation. Also, the presence of PVAT-released vasoconstrictive factors was suspected.</p>

<p>Obesity-associated metabolic alterations are closely linked to low-grade inflammation in peripheral organs, in which macrophages play a central role. Using genetic labeling of myeloid lineage cells, we show that hypothalamic macrophages normally reside in the perivascular area and circumventricular organ median eminence. Chronic consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) induces expansion of the monocyte-derived macrophage pool in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), which is significantly attributed to enhanced proliferation of macrophages. Notably, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is robustly activated in ARC macrophages of HFD-fed obese mice. Hypothalamic macrophage iNOS inhibition completely abrogates macrophage accumulation and activation, proinflammatory cytokine overproduction, reactive astrogliosis, blood-brain-barrier permeability, and lipid accumulation in the ARC of obese mice. Moreover, central iNOS inhibition improves obesity-induced alterations in systemic glucose metabolism without affecting adiposity. Our findings suggest a critical role for hypothalamic macrophage-expressed iNOS in hypothalamic inflammation and abnormal glucose metabolism in cases of overnutrition-induced obesity.</p>

<p>The vascular wall within adipose tissue is a source of mesenchymal progenitors, referred to as perivascular stem/stromal cells (PSC). PSC are isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and defined as a bipartite population of pericytes and adventitial progenitor cells (APCs). Those factors that promote the differentiation of PSC into bone or fat cell types are not well understood. Here, we observed high expression of WISP-1 among human PSC in vivo, after purification, and upon transplantation in a bone defect. Next, modulation of WISP-1 expression was performed, using WISP-1 overexpression, WISP-1 protein, or WISP-1 siRNA. Results demonstrated that WISP-1 is expressed in the perivascular niche, and high expression is maintained after purification of PSC, and upon transplantation in a bone microenvironment. In vitro studies demonstrate that WISP-1 has pro-osteogenic/anti-adipocytic effects in human PSC, and that regulation of BMP signaling activity may underlie these effects. In summary, our results demonstrate the importance of the matricellular protein WISP-1 in regulation of the differentiation of human stem cell types within the perivascular niche. WISP-1 signaling upregulation may be of future benefit in cell therapy mediated bone tissue engineering, for the healing of bone defects or other orthopaedic applications.</p>

<p>One of the new targets of untapped therapeutic potential is perivascular adipose tissue (pVAT). pVAT releases a plethora of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents and is involved in the inflammatory response of the vascular wall, playing a key role in various cardiovascular pathologies. Both fiber optic Raman spectroscopy with a high-spatial resolution probe and Raman microscopy were applied to study various types of adipose tissue with the emphasis on pVATs of the thoracic and abdominal aorta and the mesenteric artery, as well as epididymal and interscapular adipose tissue for comparison. Our results demonstrated that the lipid unsaturation degree was clearly distinct in various types of adipose tissue and was influenced by the age of animals. In particular, the basal unsaturation level of pVATs of the abdominal aorta and the mesenteric artery was considerably higher than that of the thoracic aorta and a significant increase of the unsaturation level of pVAT with age was observed showing that aging has a considerable impact on the pVAT’s chemical composition. Overall, our results show that Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive tool to determine the perivascular adipose tissue chemical composition that appears to be vascular-bed specific.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), the adipose tissue that surrounds most of the vasculature, has emerged as an active component of the blood vessel wall regulating vascular homeostasis and affecting the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Although PVAT characteristics resemble both brown and white adipose tissues, recent evidence suggests that PVAT develops from its own distinct precursors implying a closer link between PVAT and vascular system. Under physiological conditions, PVAT has potent anti-atherogenic properties mediated by its ability to secrete various biologically active factors that induce non-shivering thermogenesis and metabolize fatty acids. In contrast, under pathological conditions (mainly obesity), PVAT becomes dysfunctional, loses its thermogenic capacity and secretes pro-inflammatory adipokines that induce endothelial dysfunction and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promoting atherosclerosis development. Since PVAT plays crucial roles in regulating key steps of atherosclerosis development, it may constitute a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. Here, we review the current literature regarding the roles of PVAT in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential for diagnosis of fatty liver by means of ultrasonographic measurement of liver and perivisceral adipose tissue as an alternative to blood indicators of lipomobilization and liver biopsy in periparturient high-yielding dairy cows. Thirty cows were enrolled and divided into two groups. The evaluation of body condition score (BCS), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), liver and perivisceral adipose tissue ultrasonographic measurement and histological liver lipid content (GdL) was performed at 15 ± 5 d prepartum (T0), 10 ± 2 d postpartum (T1), 30 ± 2 d postpartum (T2) and 50 ± 2 d postpartum (T3). Mesenteric fat thickness (the thickness of the perivascular adipose tissue) measured on ultrasound was shown to be an independent determinant of fatty liver. The cut-off of the ultrasonographic evaluation of the liver may be useful as a first and practical approach in identifying fatty liver. In conclusion, a non-invasive and reliable diagnostic method for predicting the risk of fatty liver in high yielding dairy cows has been demonstrated.</p>

<p>The dietary fatty acid 10,12 conjugated linoleic acid (10,12 CLA) promotes weight loss by increasing fat oxidation, but its effects on atherosclerosis are less clear. We recently showed that weight loss induced by 10,12 CLA in an atherosclerosis-susceptible mouse model with characteristics similar to human metabolic syndrome is accompanied by accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages within subcutaneous adipose tissue. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether 10,12 CLA-mediated weight loss was associated with an atheroprotective phenotype. Male low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (Ldlr<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were made obese with 12 weeks of a high-fat, high-sucrose diet feeding (HFHS: 36% fat, 36% sucrose, 0.15% added cholesterol), then either continued on the HFHS diet with or without caloric restriction (CR), or switched to a diet with 1% of the lard replaced by either 9,11 CLA or 10,12 CLA for 8 weeks. Atherosclerosis and lipid levels were quantified at sacrifice. Weight loss in mice following 10,12 CLA supplementation or CR as a weight-matched control group had improved cholesterol and triglyceride levels, yet only the 10,12 CLA-treated mice had improved en face and aortic sinus atherosclerosis. 10,12 CLA-supplemented mice had increased lesion macrophage content, with enrichment of surrounding perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) alternative macrophages, which may contribute to the anti-atherosclerotic effect of 10,12 CLA.</p>

<p>Mouse adipocytes have been reported to release aldosterone and reduce endothelium-dependent relaxation. It is unknown whether perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases aldosterone in humans. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that human PVAT releases aldosterone and induces endothelial dysfunction. Vascular reactivity was assessed in human internal mammary and renal segmental arteries obtained at surgery. The arteries were prepared with/without PVAT, and changes in isometric tension were measured in response to the vasoconstrictor thromboxane prostanoid receptor agonist U46619 and the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. The effects of exogenous aldosterone and of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist eplerenone were determined. Aldosterone concentrations were measured by ELISA in conditioned media incubated with human adipose tissue with/without angiotensin II stimulation. Presence of aldosterone synthase and MR mRNA was examined in perirenal, abdominal, and mammary PVAT by PCR. U46619 -induced tension and acetylcholine-induced relaxation were unaffected by exogenous and endogenous aldosterone (addition of aldosterone and MR blocker) in mammary and renal segmental arteries, both in the presence and absence of PVAT. Aldosterone release from incubated perivascular fat was not detectable. Aldosterone synthase expression was not consistently observed in human adipose tissues in contrast to that of MR. Thus, exogenous aldosterone does not affect vascular reactivity and endothelial function in ex vivo human arterial segments, and the tested human adipose tissues have no capacity to synthesize/release aldosterone. In perspective, physiologically relevant effects of aldosterone on vascular function in humans are caused by systemic aldosterone originating from the adrenal gland.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling is dictated by coordinated interactions between adipocytes and resident stromal-vascular cells; however, the functional heterogeneity of adipose stromal cells has remained unresolved. We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and FACS to identify and isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of PDGFRß+ stromal cells within visceral WAT of adult mice. LY6C- CD9- PDGFRß+ cells represent highly adipogenic visceral adipocyte precursor cells (‘APCs’), whereas LY6C+ PDGFRß+ cells represent fibro-inflammatory progenitors (‘FIPs’). FIPs lack adipogenic capacity, display pro-fibrogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotypes, and can exert an anti-adipogenic effect on APCs. The pro-inflammatory phenotype of PDGFRß+ cells is regulated, at least in part, by NR4A nuclear receptors. These data highlight the functional heterogeneity of visceral WAT perivascular cells, and provide insight into potential cell-cell interactions impacting adipogenesis and inflammation. These improved strategies to isolate FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT will facilitate the study of physiological WAT remodeling and mechanisms leading to metabolic dysfunction.This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

<p>Clinical studies have shown that obesity negatively impacts large arteries’ function. We reported that rats exposed to maternal separation (MatSep), a model of early life stress, display enhanced angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced vasoconstriction in aortic rings cleaned of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) under normal diet (ND) conditions. We hypothesized that exposure to MatSep promotes a greater loss of PVAT-mediated protective effects on vascular function and loss of blood pressure (BP) rhythm in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) when compared with controls. MatSep was performed in male Wistar-Kyoto rats from days 2 to 14 of life. Normally reared littermates served as controls. On ND, aortic rings from MatSep rats with PVAT removed showed increased ANG II-mediated vasoconstriction versus controls; however, rings from MatSep rats with intact PVAT displayed blunted constriction. This effect was exacerbated by an HFD in both groups; however, the anticontractile effect of PVAT was greater in MatSep rats. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was similar in MatSep and control rats fed an ND, regardless of the presence of PVAT. HFD impaired aortic relaxation in rings without PVAT from MatSep rats, whereas the presence of PVAT improved relaxation in both groups. On an HFD, immunolocalization of vascular smooth muscle-derived ANG-(1-7) and PVAT-derived adiponectin abundances were increased in MatSep. In rats fed an HFD, 24-h BP and BP rhythms were similar between groups. In summary, MatSep enhanced the ability of PVAT to blunt the heightened ANG II-induced vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction in rats fed an HFD. This protective effect may be mediated via the upregulation of vasoprotective factors within the adipovascular axis.</p>

<p>Histologic and radiologic studies describe intramyocardial fat tissue as a normal finding or as part of cardiac pathology. The role of fat cells within the myocardium is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess fat tissue distribution in the myocardium of right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) and age differences in subjects free from cardiac disease. The study included 10 males without cardiac disease divided into two groups according to age (below/above 50 years). Three cross sections were performed (RV free wall and apex and RA free wall) with histomorphological analysis on digital photographs. The shares of total myocardial fat (TMF), peri-vascular fat (PVF) and non-perivascular (nPVF) fat were calculated. Samples from the older group had larger amounts of fat in the epicardium and myocardium, without statistically significant differ-ence (TMF p=0.847, PVF p=0.4 and nPVF p=0.4). The largest quantities of fat tissue were found in the RV apex samples (14.9%), followed by RV free wall (7.5%) and RA (4.5%), where total apical RV fat share was significantly larger than in RA sample (p=0.044). Intramyocardial fat cells were present within the non-diseased RA and RV in all samples, mostly in the apex. Further investigations on age difference, effect of visceral obesity and sex differences are needed.</p>

<p>Autologous adipose tissue is used for tissue repletion and/or regeneration as an intact lipoaspirate or as enzymatically derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which may be first cultured into mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Alternatively, transplant of autologous adipose tissue mechanically fragmented into submillimeter clusters has recently showed remarkable efficacy in diverse therapeutic indications. To document the biologic basis of the regenerative potential of microfragmented adipose tissue, we first analyzed the distribution of perivascular presumptive MSCs in adipose tissue processed with the Lipogems technology, observing a significant enrichment in pericytes, at the expense of adventitial cells, as compared to isogenic enzymatically processed lipoaspirates. The importance of MSCs as trophic and immunomodulatory cells, due to the secretion of specific factors, has been described. Therefore, we investigated protein secretion by cultured adipose tissue clusters or enzymatically derived SVF using secretome arrays. In culture, microfragmented adipose tissue releases many more growth factors and cytokines involved in tissue repair and regeneration, noticeably via angiogenesis, compared to isogenic SVF. Therefore, we suggest that the efficient tissue repair/regeneration observed after transplantation of microfragmented adipose tissue is due to the secretory ability of the intact perivascular niche.

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fat radiodensity, measured via CT Hounsfield units (HU), is a potential marker of fat quality. We sought to determine the cross-sectional associations of total heart fat (TAT) and aortic perivascular fat (PVAT) radiodensity with cardiovascular risk factors, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and aortic calcification (AC) in midlife women.METHODS: Fat radiodensity, CAC, and AC were quantified using CT scans. A total of 528 women (mean age: 50.9<U+202F>±<U+202F>2.9 years; 37% Black) were included in analyses.RESULTS: Women in the lowest TAT radiodensity tertile were more likely to have adverse cardiovascular risk factors. Independent of cardiovascular risk factors, women in the middle and high TAT radiodensity tertiles were less likely to have CAC (OR (95% CI): 0.32 (0.18, 0.59); 0.43 (0.24, 0.78), respectively) compared with women in the lowest TAT radiodensity tertile. Although adjusting for BMI attenuated the overall association, women in the middle TAT radiodensity tertile remained at significantly lower odds of CAC when compared to the low radiodensity tertile, 0.47 (0.24, 0.93), p=0.03. No significant associations were found for PVAT radiodensity and calcification measures in multivariable analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Lower TAT radiodensity was associated with a less favorable cardiometabolic profile. Women with mid-range TAT radiodensity values had a lower odds of CAC presence, independent of CVD risk factors and BMI. More research is necessary to understand radiodensity as a surrogate marker of fat quality in midlife women.</p>

<p>Despite the existing preventative and therapeutic measures, cardiovascular diseases remain the main cause of temporary disability, long-term disability, and mortality. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and their complications. However, not all fat depots have the same inflammatory, paracrine, and metabolic activities. In addition, recent studies have indicated that the accumulation of visceral fat, rather than subcutaneous fat, is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. However, there is also evidence that increasing the area of visceral fat can help protect against lipotoxicity. This review aims to discuss the contemporary literature regarding the characteristics of the visceral, epicardial, and perivascular fat depots, as well as their associations with cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer-related extremity lymphedema is a potentially devastating condition. Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) has shown benefit in lymphedema treatment. Due to concerns over potential iatrogenic complications, various donor sites have been described. The current study aims at defining the deep inferior epigastric lymph node basin as a novel donor site for VLNT.METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on patients undergoing routine abdominal-based breast reconstruction. Resection of all perivascular adipose and lymphatic tissue surrounding the proximal deep inferior epigastric pedicle was performed at the time of pedicle dissection and submitted for Pathologic evaluation. Patient demographics and pertinent medical/surgical history was obtained from medical records.RESULTS: Specimens were obtained from 10 consecutive patients. Seven patients underwent bilateral reconstruction for a total of 17 specimens obtained. Mean patient age and BMI were 48<U+2009>years ± 9.4 and 27 ± 4.2, respectively. Fourteen out of 17 (82%) specimens contained viable lymph nodes displaying a thin fibrous connective tissue capsule overlying an unremarkable subcapsular sinus with a cortex and paracortex containing germinal centers composed of B lymphocytes, tangible body macrophages, and T-cells. The medullary sinus space displayed a fatty unremarkable hilum. The mean number and size of lymph nodes were 2.6<U+2009>±1.2 nodes/specimen and 3.67<U+2009>mm ± 2.3, respectively. All patients experienced an uneventful postoperative course without evidence any of compromised flap viability.CONCLUSION: Lacking previous description, the deep inferior epigastric lymph node basin is a readily accessible donor site with significant anatomic advantages for potential VLNT during autologous breast reconstruction.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Achilles tendon rupture is a common injury and the best treatment option remains uncertain between surgical and nonoperative methods. Biologic approaches using multipotent stem cells such as perivascular stem cells pose a possible treatment option, although there is currently a paucity of evidence regarding their clinical therapeutic use.PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether injected perivascular stem cells (PSCs) would (1) improve histologic signs of tendon healing (such as percent area of collagen); and (2) improve biomechanical properties (peak load or stiffness) in a rat model of Achilles tendon transection.METHODS: Two subtypes of PSCs were derived from human adipose tissue: pericytes (CD146CD34CD45CD31) and adventitial cells (CD146CD34CD45CD31). Thirty-two athymic rats underwent right Achilles transection and were randomized to receive injection with saline (eight tendons), hydrogel (four tendons), pericytes in hydrogel (four tendons), or adventitial cells in hydrogel (eight tendons) 3 days postoperatively with the left serving as an uninjured control. Additionally, a subset of pericytes was labeled with CM-diI to track cell viability and localization. At 3 weeks, the rats were euthanized, and investigators blinded to treatment group allocation evaluated tendon healing by peak load and stiffness using biomechanical testing and percent area of collagen using histologic analysis with picrosirius red staining.RESULTS: Histologic analysis showed a higher mean percent area collagen for pericytes (30%) and adventitial cells (28%) than hydrogel (21%) or saline (26%). However, a nonparametric statistical analysis yielded no statistical difference. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the pericyte group had a higher peak load than the saline group (41 ± 7 N versus 26 ± 9 N; mean difference 15 N; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4-27 N; p = 0.003) and a higher peak load than the hydrogel group (41 ± 7 N versus 25 ± 3 N; mean difference 16; 95% CI, 8-24 N; p = 0.001). The pericyte group demonstrated higher stiffness than the hydrogel group (36 ± 12 N/mm versus 17 ± 6 N/mm; mean difference 19 N/mm; 95% CI, 5-34 N/mm; p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that injection of PSCs improves mechanical but not the histologic properties of early Achilles tendon healing.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is a preliminary study that provides more insight into the use of adipose-derived PSCs as a percutaneous therapy in the setting of Achilles tendon rupture. Further experiments to characterize the function of these cells may serve as a pathway to development of minimally invasive intervention aimed at improving nonoperative management while avoiding the complications associated with surgical treatment down the line.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) refers to the local aggregate of adipose tissue surrounding the vascular tree, exhibiting phenotypes from white to brown and beige adipocytes. Although PVAT has long been regarded as simply a structural unit providing mechanical support to vasculature, it is now gaining reputation as an integral endocrine/paracrine component, in addition to the well-established modulator endothelium, in regulating vascular tone. Since the discovery of anti-contractile effect of PVAT in 1991, the use of multiple rodent models of reduced amounts of PVAT has revealed its regulatory role in vascular remodeling and cardiovascular implications, including atherosclerosis. PVAT does not only release PVAT-derived relaxing factors (PVRFs) to activate multiple subsets of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potassium channels and anti-inflammatory signals in the vasculature, but it does also provide an interface for neuron-adipocyte interactions in the vascular wall to regulate arterial vascular tone. In this review, we outline our current understanding towards PVAT and attempt to provide hints about future studies that can sharpen the therapeutic potential of PVAT against cardiovascular diseases and their complications.</p>

However, the ability of the perivascular FAI to predict clinical outcomes is unknown.In the Cardiovascular RISk Prediction using Computed Tomography (CRISP-CT) study, we did a post-hoc analysis of outcome data gathered prospectively from two independent cohorts of consecutive patients undergoing coronary CTA in Erlangen, Germany (derivation cohort) and Cleveland, OH, USA (validation cohort). Perivascular fat attenuation mapping was done around the three major coronary arteries-the proximal right coronary artery, the left anterior descending artery, and the left circumflex artery. We assessed the prognostic value of perivascular fat attenuation mapping for all-cause and cardiac mortality in Cox regression models, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, tube voltage, modified Duke coronary artery disease index, and number of coronary CTA-derived high-risk plaque features.</AbstractText>: In the Cardiovascular RISk Prediction using Computed Tomography (CRISP-CT) study, we did a post-hoc analysis of outcome data gathered prospectively from two independent cohorts of consecutive patients undergoing coronary CTA in Erlangen, Germany (derivation cohort) and Cleveland, OH, USA (validation cohort). Perivascular fat attenuation mapping was done around the three major coronary arteries-the proximal right coronary artery, the left anterior descending artery, and the left circumflex artery. We assessed the prognostic value of perivascular fat attenuation mapping for all-cause and cardiac mortality in Cox regression models, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, tube voltage, modified Duke coronary artery disease index, and number of coronary CTA-derived high-risk plaque features.Between 2005 and 2009, 1872 participants in the derivation cohort underwent coronary CTA (median age 62 years [range 17-89]). Between 2008 and 2016, 2040 patients in the validation cohort had coronary CTA (median age 53 years [range 19-87]). Median follow-up was 72 months (range 51-109) in the derivation cohort and 54 months (range 4-105) in the validation cohort. In both cohorts, high perivascular FAI values around the proximal right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery (but not around the left circumflex artery) were predictive of all-cause and cardiac mortality and correlated strongly with each other. Therefore, the perivascular FAI measured around the right coronary artery was used as a representative biomarker of global coronary inflammation (for prediction of cardiac mortality, hazard ratio [HR] 2·15, 95% CI 1·33-3·48; p=0·0017 in the derivation cohort, and 2·06, 1·50-2·83; p&lt;0·0001 in the validation cohort). The optimum cutoff for the perivascular FAI, above which there is a steep increase in cardiac mortality, was ascertained as -70·1 Hounsfield units (HU) or higher in the derivation cohort (HR 9·04, 95% CI 3·35-24·40; p&lt;0·0001 for cardiac mortality; 2·55, 1·65-3·92; p&lt;0·0001 for all-cause mortality). This cutoff was confirmed in the validation cohort (HR 5·62, 95% CI 2·90-10·88; p&lt;0·0001 for cardiac mortality; 3·69, 2·26-6·02; p&lt;0·0001 for all-cause mortality). Perivascular FAI improved risk discrimination in both cohorts, leading to significant reclassification for all-cause and cardiac mortality.</AbstractText>: Between 2005 and 2009, 1872 participants in the derivation cohort underwent coronary CTA (median age 62 years [range 17-89]).

TNF-a, generated either in small vessels or within the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) of patients with obesity, stimulates reactive oxygen species generation, mainly through NAD(P)H oxidase activation, which in turn reduces nitric oxide (NO) availability. These aspects are highlighted by the insulin resistance status and macronutrient intake that characterize the obesity condition.

<p>Human subcutaneous adipose tissue has been recognized as a rich source of tissue resident mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) in recent years. The current study was designed to sort the minipig (mp) perivascular stem cells (PSCs) and investigate the osteogenic potential. Purification of human PSCs was achieved via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from human liposuction samples [cluster of differentiation (CD)45-CD34-CD146+ perithelial cells and CD45-CD34+CD146- adventitial cells]. Subsequently, PSCs were isolated from mp adipose tissue samples (n=9), characterized and, using purified mpPSCs (obtained by FACS, which is used in human PSC purification), the mpPSC osteogenic and adipogenic potential was evaluated by Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O staining in vitro, respectively. The cell morphometry was observed following cell isolation and culture, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to identify the fat tissue structure and vascular distribution. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation-associated gene expression levels were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that the same antigens used for human PSC identification and isolation were working in mp tissue (CD45, CD146 and CD34). The two cell groups: CD45-CD34-CD146+ pericytes and CD45-CD34+CD146- adventitial cells were successfully isolated from the subcutaneous fat in the posterior neck of mps, mpPSCs accounted for 8.6% of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) with 1.4% pericytes and 7.2% adventitial cells. mpPSCs demonstrated characteristics of MSCs, including cell surface marker expression, colony forming unit-fibroblast inclusion, and the stronger osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential than that of the non-selected vascular stromal cells. The mRNA expression levels of osteocalcin, collagen, type I, a1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> in the mpPSCs group were significantly higher than those of the unsorted pSVF group (P&lt;0.05). Thus, the current study successfully isolated and cultured CD146+ and CD34+ cell populations from mp tissues, characterized the cells’ PSC-like phenotype and identified their distinctly osteogenic and adipogenic potential.</p>

The goal of this study was to evaluate differences in the brown-like characteristic and proteome among human EAT, PAT, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to identify candidate molecules causing CAD. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and other brown-related proteins were highly expressed in pericardial adipose tissue but was weakly expressed in SAT from the same non-CAD patient. Moreover, pericardial adipose tissues displayed a higher thermogenesis than SAT. However, brown-related genes were lower in CAD pericardial fat. Remarkably, there were lower levels of metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid metabolism in pericardial adipose tissues of CAD. EAT is an organ adjacent to aortic root without anatomy barriers, which differs from PAT. We found that the expression of ribosomal protein S3A (RPS3A) was decreased in human EAT as well as in mouse perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Knockdown of RPS3A significantly inhibited adipocyte differentiation in preadipocytes and impaired the function of mitochondria in mature adipocytes. Moreover, RPS3A knockdown in mouse periaortic adipose tissue impaired browning of PVAT, accelerated vascular inflammation, and atherosclerosis progression. Mechanistically, RPS3A can migrate to the mitochondria to maintain the function of brown adipocytes. These findings provide compelling evidence that RPS3A was a key factor for modulating the brown fat-specific gene UCP-1 and carbon metabolic enzymes in EAT for preventing CAD.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is currently seen as a paracrine organ that produces vasoactive substances, including inflammatory agents, which may have an impact on the vasculature. In this study PVAT density was quantified in patients with an aortic aneurysm and compared with those with a non-dilated aorta. Since chronic inflammation, as the pathway to medial thinning, is a hallmark of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), it was hypothesised that PVAT density is higher in AAA patients.METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective case control study, three groups of patients were included: non-treated asymptomatic AAA (n = 140), aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) (n = 104), and individuals without aortic pathology (n = 97). A Hounsfield units based analysis was performed by computed tomography (CT). As a proxy for PVAT, the density of adipose tissue 10 mm circumferential to the infrarenal aorta was analysed in each consecutive CT slice. Intra-individual PVAT differences were reported as the difference in PVAT density between the region of the maximum AAA diameter (or the mid-aortic region in patients with AIOD or controls) and the two uppermost slices of infrarenal non-dilated aorta just below the renal arteries. Furthermore, subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue measurements were performed. Linear models were fitted to assess the association between the study groups, different adipose tissue compartments, and between adipose tissue compartments and aortic dimensions.RESULTS: AAA patients presented higher intra-individual PVAT differences, with higher PVAT density around the aneurysm sac than the healthy neck. This association persisted after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and diseases and other fat compartments (ß = 13.175, SE 4.732, p = .006). Furthermore, intra-individual PVAT differences presented the highest correlation with aortic volume that persisted after adjustment for other fat compartments, body mass index, sex, and age (ß = 0.566, 0.200, p = .005).CONCLUSION: The results suggest a relation between the deposition of PVAT and AAA pathophysiology. Further research should explore the exact underlying processes.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds blood vessels and regulates vascular tone through paracrine secretion of cytokines. During conditions promoting cardiometabolic dysfunction, such as obesity, cytokine secretion is altered towards a proinflammatory and proatherogenic profile.

We are interested in characterizing the resident adipose progenitor cells (APCs) because of their potential role in PVAT expansion during obesity.

<p>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have several similar risk factors but different pathogenesis. Inflammation of the arteries is common to both. Central obesity can act as an endocrine organ through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and the perivascular fat has a local effect that could contribute to diseases of the abdominal aorta. Although the relation between central obesity and atherosclerosis occlusive arterial disease has been demonstrated, the correlation with AAA has conflicting results. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between central obesity and the presence of abdominal aortic diseases using computed tomography.METHODS: Six hundred thirty-nine consecutive patients classified into 3 groups (AAA, aortic atherosclerotic occlusive disease (AAOD), and without aortic disease [control group]) who underwent computed tomography had the aorta diameter, the visceral fat area (VFA), and the subcutaneous fat area (SFA) measured at the level of third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.RESULTS: VFA showed no difference between the groups. SFA was lower in atherosclerotic group (AAOD) than control (P &lt; 0.01 in general and P &lt; 0.04 in male). In AAA group, we found in men that the first tertile of aorta diameter had higher VFA than third tertile (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in VFA between patients in AAA, AAOD, and without aortic disease groups. In men with aneurysm, there was an inverse relationship between VFA and aortic diameter. In AAOD, visceral to subcutaneous ratio is higher due to lower SFA.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Regional fat density assessed by computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as a marker of perivascular adipose tissue inflammation. Dual energy CT (DECT) allows improved tissue characterization compared to conventional CT.PURPOSE: To explore whether DECT might aid regional fat density discrimination.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included patients who had completed a non-enhanced cardiac CT scan, CT coronary angiography (CTCA), and a delayed enhancement CT. Attenuation levels (Hounsfield units [HU]) were assessed at the epicardial, paracardial, visceral, and subcutaneous fat. The number of coronary segments with disease (SIS) was calculated.RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were included in the analysis. Twenty-six (72%) patients had evidence of obstructive disease at CCTA and 25 (69%) patients had evidence of previous myocardial infarction. At non-contrast CT, we did not identify significant attenuation differences between epicardial, paracardial, subcutaneous, and visceral fat depots (-110.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>9 HU, vs. -113.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>9 HU, vs. -114.7<U+2009>±<U+2009>8 HU, vs. -113.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>11 HU, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.36). Significant attenuation differences were detected between fat depots at mid and low energy levels, both at CTCA and delayed-enhancement scans ( P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05 for all). Epicardial fat showed the least negative attenuation, irrespective of the acquisition mode; epicardial fat evaluated at 40<U+2009>keV was related to the SIS (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.37, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, regional fat depots amenable to examination during thoracic CT scans have distinctive regional attenuation values. Furthermore, such differences were better displayed using contrast-enhanced monochromatic imaging at low energy levels.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has the capacity to secrete vasoactive mediators with the potential to regulate vascular function. Given its location adjacent to the vasculature, PVAT dysfunction may be part of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. To study the mechanisms of PVAT dysfunction, several adipogenic models have been proposed. However, these approaches do not adequately reflect PVAT adipocyte phenotypes variability that depends on their anatomical location. Despite PVAT importance in modulating vascular function, to date, there is not a depot-specific adipogenic model for PVAT adipocytes. We present a model that uses coculturing of PVAT stromal vascular fraction derived preadipocytes with primary adipocytes isolated from the same PVAT. Preadipocytes were isolated from thoracic aorta PVAT and mesenteric resistance artery PVAT (mPVAT). Upon confluency, cells were induced to differentiate for 7 and 14 days using a standard protocol (SP) or standard protocol cocultured with primary adipocytes isolated from the same adipose depots (SPA) for 96, 120, and 144 h. SPA reduced the time for differentiation of stromal vascular fraction derived preadipocytes and increased their capacity to store lipids compared with SP as indicated by lipid accumulation, lipolytic responses, gene marker profile expression, and adiponectin secretion. The coculture system improved adipogenesis efficiency by enhancing lipid accumulation and reducing the time of induction, therefore, is a more efficient method compared to SP alone.</p>

<p>Firstly identified by anatomists, the fat tissue is nowadays an area of intense research due to increased global prevalence of obesity and its associated diseases. Histologically, there are four types of fat tissue cells which are currently recognized (white, brown, beige, and perivascular adipocytes). Therefore, in this study we are reviewing the most recent data regarding the origin, structure, and molecular mechanisms involved in the development of adipocytes. White adipocytes can store triglycerides as a consequence of lipogenesis, under the regulation of growth hormone or leptin and adiponectin, and release fatty acids resulted from lipolysis, under the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system, glucocorticoids, TNF-a, insulin, and natriuretic peptides. Brown adipocytes possess a mitochondrial transmembrane protein thermogenin or UCP1 which allows heat generation. Recently, thermogenic, UCP positive adipocytes have been identified in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue and have been named beige adipocytes. The nature of these cells is still controversial, as current theories are suggesting their origin either by transdifferentiation of white adipocytes, or by differentiation from an own precursor cell. Perivascular adipocytes surround most of the arteries, exhibiting a supportive role and being involved in the maintenance of intravascular temperature. Thoracic perivascular adipocytes resemble brown adipocytes, while abdominal ones are more similar to white adipocytes and, consequently, are involved in obesity-induced inflammatory reactions. The factors involved in the regulation of adipose stem cells differentiation may represent potential pathways to inhibit or to divert adipogenesis. Several molecules, such as pro-adipogenic factors (FGF21, BMP7, BMP8b, and Cox-2), cell surface proteins or receptors (Asc-1, PAT2, P2RX5), and hypothalamic receptors (MC4R) have been identified as the most promising targets for the development of future therapies. Further investigations are necessary to complete the knowledge about adipose tissue and the development of a new generation of therapeutic tools based on molecular targets.</p>

<p>Arterial stiffness is an inevitable consequence of the aging process and is considered an early stage in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature actively involved in blood pressure regulation and atherosclerosis development via PVAT-derived paracrine/autocrine factors. However, there is little knowledge regarding the relationship between PVAT and arterial stiffness.</AbstractText>: Arterial stiffness is an inevitable consequence of the aging process and is considered an early stage in the development of cardiovascular diseases.

High-fat diet feeding of aging C57BL/6J wild-type mice significantly induced hypertrophic PVAT and enhanced arterial stiffness. Furthermore, the expression of mitoNEET, a mitochondrial membrane protein related to energy expenditure, was significantly increased by pioglitazone treatment, while reduced in the hypertrophic PVAT induced by high-fat diet. Overexpression of mitoNEET in PVAT reduced the expression of inflammatory genes and was associated with lower pulse wave velocity in aging mice.</AbstractText>: We found that lack of PVAT enhanced arterial stiffness in aging mice.

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), a special type of adipose tissue, closely surrounds vascular adventitia and produces numerous bioactive substances to maintain vascular homeostasis. PVAT dysfunction has a crucial role in regulating vascular remodeling, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how obesity-induced PVAT dysfunction affected adventitia remodeling in early vascular injury stages. Mini pigs were fed a high sugar and fat diet for 6 months to induce metabolic syndrome and obesity. In the mini pigs, left carotid vascular injury was then generated using balloon dilation. Compared with normal mini pigs, obese mini pigs displayed significantly enhanced vascular injury-induced adventitial responses, evidenced by adventitia fibroblast (AF) proliferation and differentiation, and adventitia fibrosis, as well as exacerbated PVAT dysfunction characterized by increased accumulation of resident macrophages, particularly the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, increased expression of leptin and decreased expression of adiponectin, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-18. Primary AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium from obese mini pigs also showed significantly increased proliferation and differentiation. We further revealed that activated nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and its downstream products, i.e., IL-1 family members such as IL-1ß and IL-18 were upregulated in the PVAT of obese mini pigs; PVAT dysfunction was also demonstrated in preadipocytes treated with palmitic acid. Finally, we showed that pretreatment with IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonist or IL-1R knockdown blocked AF proliferation and differentiation in AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium. These results demonstrate that obesity-induced PVAT dysfunction aggravates adventitial remodeling after early vascular injury with elevated AF proliferation and differentiation via activating the NLRP3/IL-1 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) influences vascular function and pathology. We present a protocol using micro-computed tomography (microCT), a novel imaging technique typically used for hard biological tissue, to characterize the temporal and spatial development of aorta PVAT and luminal plaque soft tissue. Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) and C57Bl/6J (control) mice were fed a high fat western diet up to 30 weeks. 3D microCT reconstructions were used to quantify: 1) vascular wall volume, a surrogate measure of remodeling, was greater in ApoE, 2) aorta PVAT volume was reduced in ApoE, 3) plaque volumes increased over time in ApoE, 4) plaque development co-localized with luminal ostia, origins of branching arteries, which traveled through areas of greatest PVAT volume, 5) qualitatively, the same arteries showed evidence of increased tortuosity in ApoE. This study reflects the potential of microCT analyses to assess vascular wall, PVAT and arterial trajectory modifications in relevant animal models.

<p>Objective- Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes to vascular homeostasis by producing paracrine factors. Previously, we reported that selective deletion of PPAR<U+03B3> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3>) in vascular smooth muscle cells resulted in concurrent loss of PVAT and enhanced atherosclerosis in mice. To address the causal relationship between loss of PVAT and atherosclerosis, we used BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO (brown adipocyte-specific PPAR<U+03B3> knockout) mice. Approach and Results- Deletion of PPAR<U+03B3> in brown adipocytes did not affect PPAR<U+03B3> in white adipocytes or vascular smooth muscle cells or PPARa and PPARd expression in brown adipocytes. However, development of PVAT and interscapular brown adipose tissue was remarkably impaired, associated with reduced expression of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes in the BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO mice. Thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue was significantly impaired with reduced expression of thermogenesis genes in brown adipose tissue and compensatory increase in subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissues. Remarkably, basal expression of inflammatory genes and macrophage infiltration in PVAT and brown adipose tissue were significantly increased in the BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO mice. BA-PPAR<U+03B3>-KO mice were crossbred with ApoE KO (apolipoprotein E knockout) mice to investigate the development of atherosclerosis. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed increased systemic and PVAT inflammation. Consequently, atherosclerotic lesions were significantly increased in mice with impaired PVAT development, thus indicating that the lack of normal PVAT is sufficient to drive increased atherosclerosis. Conclusions- PPAR<U+03B3> is required for functional PVAT development. PPAR<U+03B3> deficiency in PVAT, while still expressed in vascular smooth muscle cell, enhances atherosclerosis and results in vascular and systemic inflammation, providing new insights on the specific roles of PVAT in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease at large.</p>

<p>Herpesviruses include many important human pathogens such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, and the oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Herpes virions contain a large icosahedral capsid that has a portal at a unique 5-fold vertex, similar to that seen in the tailed bacteriophages. The portal is a molecular motor through which the viral genome enters the capsid during virion morphogenesis. The genome also exits the capsid through the portal-vertex when it is injected through the nuclear pore into the nucleus of a new host cell to initiate infection. Structural investigations of the herpesvirus portal-vertex have proven challenging, owing to the small size of the tail-like portal-vertex-associated tegument (PVAT) and the presence of the tegument layer that lays between the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope, obscuring the view of the portal-vertex. Here, we show the structure of the herpes simplex virus portal-vertex at subnanometer resolution, solved by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) and single-particle 3D reconstruction. This led to a number of new discoveries, including the presence of two previously unknown portal-associated structures that occupy the sites normally taken by the penton and the Ta triplex. Our data revealed that the PVAT is composed of 10 copies of the C-terminal domain of pUL25, which are uniquely arranged as two tiers of star-shaped density. Our 3D reconstruction of the portal-vertex also shows that one end of the viral genome extends outside the portal in the manner described for some bacteriophages but not previously seen in any eukaryote viruses. Finally, we show that the viral genome is consistently packed in a highly ordered left-handed spool to form concentric shells of DNA. Our data provide new insights into the structure of a molecular machine critical to the biology of an important class of human pathogens.</p>

<p>Many of the comorbidities of obesity, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, are related to the low-grade chronic inflammation of white adipose tissue. Under white adipocyte stress, local infiltration of immune cells and enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines together reduce metabolic flexibility and lead to insulin resistance in obesity. Whereas white adipocytes act in energy storage, brown and beige adipocytes specialize in energy expenditure. Brown and beige activity protects against obesity and associated metabolic disorders, such as hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Compared to white fat, brown adipose tissue depots are less susceptible to developing local inflammation in response to obesity; however, strong obesogenic insults ultimately induce a locally pro-inflammatory environment in brown fat. This condition directly alters the thermogenic activity of brown fat by impairing its energy expenditure mechanism and uptake of glucose for use as a fuel substrate. Pro-inflammatory cytokines also impair beige adipogenesis, which occurs mainly in subcutaneous adipose tissue. There is evidence that inflammatory processes occurring in perivascular adipose tissues alter their brown-versus-white plasticity, impair the extent of browning in these depots and favour the local release of vasculature damaging signals. In summary, the targeting of brown and beige adipose tissues by pro-inflammatory signals and the subsequent impairment of their thermogenic and metabolite draining activities appears to represent obesity-driven disturbances that contribute to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular alterations in obesity.</p>

<p>Human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are isolated from a plethora of tissue sources for cell therapy purposes. In 2006, the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) published minimal guidelines to define MSC identity. Nevertheless, many independent studies demonstrated that cells meeting the ISCT criteria possessed heterogeneous phenotypes and functionalities, heavily influenced by culture conditions. In this study, human MSC derived from many adult (bone marrow and adipose tissue) or fetal (cord blood, Wharton’s jelly, umbilical cord perivascular compartment and amniotic fluid) tissues were investigated. Their immunophenotype was analyzed to define consistent source-specific markers by extensive flow cytometry analysis and real-time qRT-PCR. CD271<sup>+</sup> subpopulations were detected in adult MSC, whereas NG2 was significantly more expressed in fetal MSC but failed validation on independent samples coming from an external laboratory. The highest number of CD271<sup>+</sup> adult MSC were detected soon after isolation in serum-based culture conditions. Furthermore, heterogeneous percentages of CD271 expression were found in platelet lysate-based or serum-free culture conditions. Finally, CD271<sup>+</sup> adult MSC showed high clonogenic and osteogenic properties as compared to CD271<sup>-</sup> cells. To conclude, in this phenotype-function correlation study CD271<sup>+</sup> subpopulation confers heterogeneity on adult MSC, confirming the need of more specific markers to address MSC properties.</p>

<p>Increased peripheral conduit artery stiffness has been shown in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction. However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon extends to the coronary vasculature. HF with preserved ejection fraction may be driven, in part, by coronary inflammation, and inhibition of the enzyme DPP-4 (dipeptidyl-peptidase 4) reduces inflammation and oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of saxagliptin-a DPP-4 inhibitor-on coronary stiffness in aortic-banded mini swine. We hypothesized saxagliptin would prevent increased coronary artery stiffness in a translational swine model with cardiac features of HF with preserved ejection fraction by inhibiting perivascular adipose tissue inflammation. Yucatan mini swine were divided into 3 groups: control, aortic-banded untreated HF, and aortic-banded saxagliptin-treated HF. Ex vivo mechanical testing was performed on the left circumflex and right coronary arteries, and advanced glycation end product, NF-<U+03BA>B (nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B), and nitrotyrosine levels were measured. An increase in the coronary elastic modulus of HF animals was associated with increased vascular advanced glycation end products, NF-<U+03BA>B, and nitrotyrosine levels compared with control and prevented by saxagliptin treatment. Aortas from healthy mice were treated with media from swine perivascular adipose tissue culture to assess its role on vascular stiffening. Conditioned media from HF and saxagliptin-treated HF animals increased mouse aortic stiffness; however, only perivascular adipose tissue from the HF group showed increased advanced glycation end products and NF-<U+03BA>B levels. In conclusion, our data show increased coronary conduit vascular stiffness was prevented by saxagliptin and associated with decreased advanced glycation end products, NF-<U+03BA>B, and nitrotyrosine levels in a swine model with potential relevance to HF with preserved ejection fraction.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) is no longer viewed as a passive, energy-storing depot, and a growing body of evidence supports the concept that both quantitative and qualitative aspects of AT are critical in determining an individual’s cardiometabolic risk profile. Among all AT sites, perivascular AT (PVAT) has emerged as a depot with a distinctive biological significance in cardiovascular disease given its close anatomical proximity to the vasculature. Recent studies have suggested the presence of complex, bidirectional paracrine and vasocrine signalling pathways between the vascular wall and its PVAT, with far-reaching implications in cardiovascular diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we first discuss the biological role of PVAT in both cardiovascular health and disease, highlighting its dual pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic roles, as well as potential therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease. We then review current evidence and promising new modalities on the non-invasive imaging of epicardial AT and PVAT. Specifically, we present how our expanding knowledge on the bidirectional interplay between the vascular wall and its PVAT can be translated into novel clinical diagnostics tools to assess coronary inflammation. To this end, we present the example of a new CT-based method that tracks spatial changes in PVAT phenotype to extract information about the inflammatory status of the adjacent vasculature, highlighting the numerous diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities that arise from our increased understanding of PVAT biology.</p>

<p>The biguanide metformin (MET) has been used during pregnancy for treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes. MET crosses the placenta and maternal treatment can expose the progeny to this drug during important phases of body development. Direct vascular protective effects have been described with the treatment of metformin. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether intrauterine exposure to metformin is safe for the vascular system of offspring. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the intrinsic effects of metformin exposure in utero in the offspring abdominal aorta reactivity, in the presence and absence of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and endothelium. For this, Wistar rats were treated with metformin 293<U+202F>mg/kg/day (MET) or water (CTR) by gavage during the gestational period. The abdominal aorta reactivity to phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside was evaluated in male adult offspring. It was observed that abdominal aorta relaxation was similar between MET and CTR groups in the presence or absence of PVAT. In addition, the contraction to phenylephrine was similar between MET and CTR groups in the presence and absence of PVAT and endothelium. Therefore, metformin exposure during pregnancy had no intrinsic effect on the offspring abdominal aorta PVAT and endothelial function, demonstrating it to be safe to the vascular system of the offspring.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and it is hypothesized that fibrosis or excess accumulation of extracellular matrix within adipose tissue may limit tissue expansion contributing to metabolic dysfunction. The pathways that control adipose tissue remodeling are only partially understood, however it is likely that adipose tissue stromal and perivascular progenitors participate in fibrotic remodeling and also serve as adipocyte progenitors. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the secreted extracellular matrix protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) on adipose progenitor differentiation in the context of adipose tissue fibrosis. Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse cells with recombinant ACLP suppressed adipogenesis and enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, which was dependent on transforming growth factor-ß receptor kinase activity. Mice fed a chronic high fat diet exhibited white adipose tissue fibrosis with elevated ACLP expression and cellular fractionation of these depots revealed that ACLP was co-expressed with collagens primarily in the inflammatory cell depleted stromal-vascular fraction (SVF). SVF cells isolated from mice fed a high fat diet secreted increased amounts of ACLP compared to low fat diet control SVF. These cells also exhibited reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Importantly, differentiation studies in primary human adipose stromal cells revealed that mature adipocytes do not express ACLP and exogenous ACLP administration blunted their differentiation potential while upregulating myofibroblastic markers. Collectively, these studies identify ACLP as a stromal derived mediator of adipose progenitor differentiation that may limit adipocyte expansion during white adipose tissue fibrosis.</p>

<p>Morphological and physiological changes in the vasculature have been described in the evolution and maintenance of hypertension. Hypertension-induced vascular dysfunction may present itself as a contributing, or consequential factor, to vascular remodeling caused by chronically elevated systemic arterial blood pressure. Changes in all vessel layers, from the endothelium to the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), have been described. This mini-review focuses on the current knowledge of the structure and function of the vessel layers, specifically muscular arteries: intima, media, adventitia, PVAT, and the cell types harbored within each vessel layer. The contributions of each cell type to vessel homeostasis and pathophysiological development of hypertension will be highlighted.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue fibrosis is associated with inflammation and insulin resistance in human obesity. In particular, visceral fat fibrosis is correlated with hyperlipidemia and ectopic fat accumulation. Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA) is an important coactivator that mediates the transcription of extracellular matrix and other fibrogenic genes. Here, we examine the role of MRTFA in the development of adipose tissue fibrosis and identify a signaling pathway that regulates the fate of vascular progenitors. We demonstrate that obesity induces the formation of Sca1<sup>-</sup>, Sma<sup>+</sup>, ITGA5<sup>+</sup> fibrogenic progenitor cells (FPCs) in adipose tissue. MRTFA deficiency in mice shifts the fate of perivascular progenitors from FPCs to adipocyte precursor cells and protects against chronic obesity-induced fibrosis and accompanying metabolic dysfunction, without a shift in energy expenditure. Our findings highlight the ITGA5-MRTFA pathway as a potential target to ameliorate obesity-associated metabolic disease.</p>

<p>Functional perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is necessary to maintain vascular physiology through both mechanical support and endocrine or paracrine ways. PVAT shows a brown adipose tissue (BAT)-like feature and the browning level of PVAT is dependent on the anatomic location and species. However, it is not clear whether PVAT browning is involved in the vascular tone regulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In the present study, we aimed to illustrate the effect of aging on PVAT browning and subsequent vasomotor reaction in SHRs. Herein we utilized histological staining and western blot to detect the characteristics of thoracic PVAT (tPVAT) in 8-week-old and 16-week-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. We also detected vascular reactivity analysis to determine the effect of tPVAT on vasomotor reaction during aging. The results showed that tPVAT had a similar phenotype to BAT, including smaller adipocyte size and positive uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) staining. Interestingly, the tPVAT of 8-week-old SHR showed increased BAT phenotypic marker expression compared to WKY, whereas the browning level of tPVAT had a more dramatic decrease from 8 to 16 weeks of age in SHR than age-matched WKY rats. The vasodilation effect of tPVAT on aortas had no significant difference in 8-week-old WKY and SHR, whereas this effect is obviously decreased in 16-week-old SHR compared to WKY. In contrast, tPVAT showed a similar vasoconstriction effect in 8- or 16-week-old WKY and SHR rats. Moreover, we identified an important vasodilator adenosine, which regulates adipocyte browning and may be a potential PVAT-derived relaxing factor. Adenosine is dramatically decreased from 8 to 16 weeks of age in the tPVAT of SHR. In summary, aging is associated with a decrease of tPVAT browning and adenosine production in SHR rats. These may result in attenuated vasodilation effect of the tPVAT in SHR during aging.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) is associated with vascular homeostasis; however, its causal effect on atherosclerosis currently remains undefined. Here, we investigated the effect of experimental PAT transplantation on atherosclerosis. The thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (tPAT) was dissected from 16-week-old wild-type mice and transplanted over the infrarenal aorta of 20-week-old apoE deficient (apoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice fed high-cholesterol diet for 3 months. Oil-red O staining after 4 weeks showed a significant 20% decrease in the atherosclerotic lesion of suprarenal aorta compared with that of sham control mice, while that of infrarenal aorta showed no difference between the two groups. TGF-ß1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in grafted tPAT than donor tPAT, accompanied by a significant increase in serum TGF-ß1 concentration, which was inversely correlated with the suprarenal lesion area (r<U+202F>=<U+202F>-0.63, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.012). Treatment with neutralizing TGF-ß antibody abrogated the anti-atherogenic effect of tPAT transplantation. Immunofluorescent analysis of grafted tPAT showed that TGF-ß-positive cells were co-localized with Mac-2-positive cells and this number was significantly increased compared with donor tPAT. There was also marked increase in mRNA expression of alternatively activated macrophages-related genes. Furthermore, the percentage of eosinophils in stromal vascular fraction of donor tPAT was much higher than that in epididymal white adipose tissue, concomitant with the significantly higher protein level of IL-4. IL-4 mRNA expression levels in grafted tPAT were increased in a time-dependent manner after tPAT transplantation. Our findings show that tPAT transplantation inhibits atherosclerosis development by exerting TGF-ß1-mediated anti-inflammatory response, which may involve alternatively activated macrophages.</p>

<p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the pathological dilation and weakening of the abdominal aorta wall. Inflammation, degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and loss of smooth muscle cells and skewing of their function are pivotal in AAA pathology. We developed a recombinant collagen-based patch (RCP) to provide structural integrity and deliver Adipose tissue-Derived Stromal Cells (ASC) for repair. Patches supported adhesion and function as well as proliferation of ASC. ASC-loaded RCPs or bare patches, applied around the aorta after AAA induction in rats, both maintained structural integrity of the aortic wall at time of explant (2w). However, wall thinning, accompanied by loss of elastin fibers and loss of medial SMC, was only attenuated in ASC-loaded RCP-treated AAA rats. Interestingly, this coincided with migration of ASC into the media and a reduced influx of macrophages. We hypothesize that the medially-migrated ASC dampened or skewed the adverse innate immunity and thus suppressed SMC apoptosis, phenotypic skewing and elastin degradation. We conclude that the periadventitial delivery of ASC with RCP suppresses development and progression of AAA, which is has an expected future clinical benefit in combination with an appropriate early screening program of patients at risk for aneurysms. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<p>Endothelial dysfunction is caused by many factors, such as dyslipidemia, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inflammation. It has been demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is the initial process of atherosclerosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important metabolic switch that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and inflammation. However, recent evidence indicates that AMPK could be a target for atherosclerosis by improving endothelial function. For instance, activation of AMPK inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species induced by mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and NADPH oxidase. Moreover, activation of AMPK inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory factors induced by dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia and restrains production of perivascular adipose tissue-released adipokines. AMPK activation prevents endothelial dysfunction by increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Therefore, we focused on the primary risk factors involved in endothelial dysfunction, and summarize the features of AMPK in the protection of endothelial function, by providing signaling pathways thought to be important in the pathological progress of risk factors.</p>

<p>Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a debilitating condition wherein muscle loss overwhelms the body’s normal physiological repair mechanism. VML is particularly common among military service members who have sustained war injuries. Because of the high social and medical cost associated with VML and suboptimal current surgical treatments, there is great interest in developing better VML therapies. Skeletal muscle tissue engineering (SMTE) is a promising alternative to traditional VML surgical treatments that use autogenic tissue grafts, and rather uses isolated stem cells with myogenic potential to generate de novo skeletal muscle tissues to treat VML. Satellite cells are the native precursors to skeletal muscle tissue, and are thus the most commonly studied starting source for SMTE. However, satellite cells are difficult to isolate and purify, and it is presently unknown whether they would be a practical source in clinical SMTE applications. Alternative myogenic stem cells, including adipose-derived stem cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, perivascular stem cells, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and embryonic stem cells, each have myogenic potential and have been identified as possible starting sources for SMTE, although they have yet to be studied in detail for this purpose. These alternative stem cell varieties offer unique advantages and disadvantages that are worth exploring further to advance the SMTE field toward highly functional, safe, and practical VML treatments. The following review summarizes the current state of satellite cell-based SMTE, details the properties and practical advantages of alternative myogenic stem cells, and offers guidance to tissue engineers on how alternative myogenic stem cells can be incorporated into SMTE research.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with increased risk of premature death, morbidity, and mortality from several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. However, this is not a straightforward relationship. Although several studies have substantiated that obesity confers an independent and additive risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, there is significant variability in these associations, with some lean individuals developing diseases and others remaining healthy despite severe obesity, the so-called metabolically healthy obese. Part of this variability has been attributed to the heterogeneity in both the distribution of body fat and the intrinsic properties of adipose tissue depots, including developmental origin, adipogenic and proliferative capacity, glucose and lipid metabolism, hormonal control, thermogenic ability, and vascularization. In obesity, these depot-specific differences translate into specific fat distribution patterns, which are closely associated with differential cardiometabolic risks. The adventitial fat layer, also known as perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), is of major importance. Similar to the visceral adipose tissue, PVAT has a pathophysiological role in CVDs. PVAT influences vascular homeostasis by releasing numerous vasoactive factors, cytokines, and adipokines, which can readily target the underlying smooth muscle cell layers, regulating the vascular tone, distribution of blood flow, as well as angiogenesis, inflammatory processes, and redox status. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge and discuss the role of PVAT within the scope of adipose tissue as a major contributing factor to obesity-associated cardiovascular risk. Relevant clinical studies documenting the relationship between PVAT dysfunction and CVD with a focus on potential mechanisms by which PVAT contributes to obesity-related CVDs are pointed out.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) loses its anti-contractile activity in obesity. Calycosin, the major bioactive isoflavonoid, was shown to protect endothelial function. However, effects of calycosin on PVAT function in obesity remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of calycosin on the anti-contractile activity of PVAT in obese mice and its potential mechanisms. Obesity in mice was induced with a high-fat diet, with or without calycosin treatment. Thoracic aorta responses to phenylephrine were determined. AMP protein kinase (AMPK) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels were analyzed by western blotting. Adiponectin, TNF-a levels and superoxide production were measured in the PVAT. Calycosin treatment significantly increased the anti-contractile response of PVAT, which was impaired in obese mice. This beneficial effect of calycosin was eliminated by treatments of blocking adiponectin, AMPK or eNOS. Similar results were observed for calycosin treatment ex vivo. Treatment of obese mice with calycosin significantly increased adiponectin levels, activated AMPK and eNOS phosphorylation and reduced superoxide production and TNF-a levels in PVAT. Our results indicated that calycosin restored PVAT induced anti-contractile activity and affected PVAT function through the adiponectin/AMPK/eNOS pathway in obese mice.</p>

<p>Traditionally, it is believed that white adipose tissues serve as energy storage, heat insulation, and mechanical cushion, whereas non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in brown adipose tissue. Recent evidence revealed that adipose tissue secretes many types of cytokines, called as adipocytokines, which modulate glucose metabolism, lipid profile, appetite, fibrinolysis, blood pressure, and inflammation. Most of the arteries are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). PVAT has been thought to be simply a structurally supportive tissue for vasculature. However, recent studies showed that PVAT influences vasodilation and vasocontraction, suggesting that PVAT regulates vascular tone and diameter. Adipocytokines secreted from PVAT appear to have direct access to the adjacent arterial wall by diffusion or via vasa vasorum. In fact, PVAT around atherosclerotic lesions and mechanically-injured arteries displayed inflammatory cytokine profiles, suggesting that PVAT functions to promote vascular lesion formation. Many clinical studies revealed that increased accumulation of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), which surrounds coronary arteries, is associated with coronary artery disease. In this review article, we will summarize recent findings about potential roles of PVAT in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, particularly focusing on a series of basic and clinical studies from our laboratory.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is commonly categorized into three types with distinct functions, phenotypes, and anatomical localizations. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the major energy store; the largest depots of WAT are found in subcutaneous or intravisceral sites. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for energy dissipation during cold-exposure (i.e., non-shivering thermogenesis) and is primarily located in the interscapular region. Beige or brite (brown-in-white) adipose tissue can be found interspersed in WAT and can attain a brown-like phenotype. These three types of tissues also have endocrine functions and play major roles in whole body metabolism especially in obesity and its co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease. Over the last years, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has emerged as an adipose organ with endocrine and paracrine functions. Pro and anti-inflammatory agents released by PVAT affect vascular health, and are implicated in the inflammatory aspects of atherosclerosis. PVAT shares several of the defining characteristics of brown adipose tissue, including its cellular morphology and expression of thermogenic genes characteristic for brown adipocytes. However, PVATs from different vessels are phenotypically different, and significant developmental differences exist between PVAT and other adipose tissues. Whether PVAT represents classical BAT, beige adipose tissue, or WAT with changing characteristics, is unclear. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on how PVAT relates to other types of adipose tissue, both in terms of functionality, developmental origins, and its role in obesity-related cardiovascular disease and inflammation.</p>

<p>Chemerin is an inflammatory adipokine positively associated with hypertension and obesity. The majority of chemerin derives from the liver and adipose tissue, however, their individual contributions to blood pressure are unknown. We began studying chemerin in the normal rat using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) with whole-body activity (Gen 2.5 chemerin ASO) or liver-restricted activity (GalNAc chemerin ASO). We hypothesized that in normotensive male Sprague-Dawley rats, circulating chemerin is predominately liver-derived and regulates blood pressure. A dosing study of the Gen 2.5 chemerin ASO (with a scrambled control ASO) supported 25 mg/kg as the appropriate dose. GalNAc chemerin ASO was also assessed and used at 10 mg/kg. Radiotelemetry monitored mean arterial pressure (MAP) for a 1-week baseline and weekly subcutaneous ASO injections for 4 weeks. Two days after the final injection, animals were euthanized for tissue reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and chemerin Western analysis. Gen 2.5 chemerin ASO treatments reduced chemerin mRNA and protein in liver, retroperitoneal fat (RP), and mesenteric perivascular adipose tissue (mPVAT), as well as reducing protein in plasma. GalNAc chemerin ASO treatments reduced chemerin mRNA and protein in liver and chemerin protein in plasma but had no effect on expression in RP fat or mPVAT. Gen 2.5 chemerin ASO treatment reduced MAP compared with control ASO but was unchanged in animals receiving the GalNAc chemerin ASO. Although circulating chemerin is liver-derived, it does not play a major role in blood pressure regulation. Local effects of chemerin from fat may explain this discrepancy and support chemerin’s association with hypertension and obesity.</p>

<p>AIM: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is in intimate contact with the vessel wall and extravascular PVAT-derived inflammatory mediators may adversely influence atherosclerotic plaque formation and stability through outside-to-inside signaling. We sought to investigate the role of PVAT on the atheroma development in an experimental animal model of metabolic syndrome (MS) associated with oxidative stress and low-grade inflammatory state. We also studied the effect of pioglitazone an insulin sensitizer, on the aortic wall and its surrounding PVAT, considering a bi-directional communication between both layers.CONCLUSION: Our results support the fact that PVAT contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease by underlying mechanisms elicited by “outside-in” signaling. Treatment with pioglitazone may offer a new effect on the whole vessel wall, promoting the stability of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.</p>

<p>Upper body adipose tissue accumulation has been associated with clustering of metabolic disorders and increased cardiovascular risk. Neck circumference (NC) indicated that subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in that region is an independent pathogenic depot that might account for the additional risk missed by visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Neck adipose tissue (NAT) is not only one more ectopic depot but has several particular features that might modulate its metabolic role. Besides a controversial impact on obstructive apnea syndrome, neck fat encompasses carotid arteries as an important perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) depot. With dysfunctional changes in obesity, physiologic vascular regulation is lost and inflammatory signals accelerate atherogenesis. Unexpected was the discovery of brown and beige adipocytes in the neck of human adults. When stimulated, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy through thermogenesis and it is associated with other favorable metabolic effects. Moreover, the neck is the region where the browning mechanism was disclosed. With this unique plastic nature, NAT revealed multiple ties, challenging dynamics and potential new therapeutic targets that might have significant implications on metabolic outcomes and vascular risk.</p>

<p>Purpose To evaluate the frequency and implications of perivascular fat stranding on coronary computed tomography (CT) angiograms obtained for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Materials and Methods This retrospective registry study was approved by the institutional review board. The authors reviewed the medical records and images of 1403 consecutive patients (796 men, 607 women; mean age, 52.8 years) who underwent coronary CT angiography at the emergency department from February 2012 to March 2016. Fat attenuation, length and number of circumferential quadrants of the affected segment, and attenuation values in the unaffected epicardial and subcutaneous fat were measured. “Cases” were defined as patients with perivascular fat stranding. Patients with significant stenosis but without fat stranding were considered control subjects. Baseline imaging characteristics, ACS frequency, and results of subsequent downstream testing were compared between cases and control subjects by using two-sample t, Mann-Whitney U, and Fisher tests. Results Perivascular fat stranding was seen in 11 subjects, nine with atherosclerotic lesions and two with spontaneous coronary artery dissections, with a mean fat stranding length of 19.2 mm and circumferential extent averaging 2.9 quadrants. The mean attenuation of perivascular fat stranding, normal epicardial fat, and normal subcutaneous fat was 17, -93.2, and -109.3 HU, respectively (P &lt; .001). Significant differences (P &lt; .05) between cases and control subjects included lower Agatston score, presence of wall motion abnormality, and initial elevation of serum troponin level. ACS frequency was 45.4% in cases and 3.8% in control subjects (P = .001). Conclusion Recognition of perivascular fat stranding may be a helpful additional predictor of culprit lesion and marker of risk for ACS in patients with significant stenosis or spontaneous coronary artery dissection. <sup>©</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue depots around the aorta are regionally distinct and have specific functional properties. Thoracic aorta perivascular adipose tissue (tPVAT) expresses higher levels of thermogenic genes and lower levels of inflammatory genes than abdominal aorta perivascular adipose tissue (aPVAT). It is not known whether this distinction is due to the in-vivo functional environment or to cell-autonomous traits that persist outside the in-vivo setting. In this study, we asked whether the progenitor cells in tPVAT and aPVAT have cell-autonomous traits that lead to formation of regionally distinct PVAT.</AbstractText>: Perivascular adipose tissue depots around the aorta are regionally distinct and have specific functional properties.

The adipokines resistin and retinol binding protein 4 were also higher in aPVAT. Furthermore, adipocyte progenitors from abdominal and thoracic aortic rings responded to TZD with expression of canonical adipocyte genes Acrp30, Plin1, and Glut4. Adipocytes differentiated from thoracic aorta progenitors displayed markedly higher induction of Ucp-1 and Cidea.</AbstractText>: Microarray analysis showed that tPVAT expressed higher levels of transcription factors related brown adipose tissue development compared to aPVAT.

<p>Saphenous vein grafts are the most common conduits used for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); however, no more than 60% of vein grafts remain open after 10 years and graft failure is associated with poor clinical outcome. The “no-touch” harvesting technique-where a sheet of perivascular tissue is retained around the vein-improves graft patency to over 80% after 16 years of follow-up, but the mechanism for the improved patency rate is unclear. In this study, we investigated acute functional differences between vein grafts harvested conventionally and by “no-touch” technique and explored the importance of perivascular tissue for reducing surgical trauma, minimizing excessive distension, and releasing vasoactive paracrine factors. Segments of human saphenous veins were obtained from CABG surgery and their functional properties investigated by isometric and isobaric myography. We found a broad diameter-tension relationship for human saphenous veins, with peak capacity for active tension development at diameters corresponding to transmural pressures around 60 mmHg. Across the investigated transmural pressure range between 10 and 120 mmHg, maximal tension development was higher for “no-touch” compared to conventionally harvested saphenous veins. Contractile responses to serotonin, noradrenaline, and depolarization induced with elevated extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] were significantly larger for saphenous veins harvested by “no-touch” compared to conventional technique. Conventional vein grafts are routinely pressurized manually in order to test for leaks; however, avoiding this distension procedure did not change the acute contractile function of the conventionally excised saphenous veins. In contrast, even though surgical removal of perivascular tissue during conventional harvesting was associated with a substantial decrease in force development, removal of perivascular tissue by careful dissection under a stereomicroscope only marginally affected contractile responses of veins harvested by “no-touch” technique. In conclusion, we show that saphenous veins harvested by “no-touch” technique have greater contractile capacity than veins harvested by conventional technique. The different capacity for smooth muscle contraction is not due to vasoactive substances released by the perivascular tissue. Instead, we propose that the larger tension development of saphenous veins harvested by “no-touch” technique reflects reduced surgical damage, which may have long-term consequences that contribute to the superior graft patency.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood pressure variation.METHODS: Using unique brown adipocyte-specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood pressure in mice.RESULTS: We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte-selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor-dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, angiotensinogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates angiotensinogen expression and the ensuing increase in angiotensin II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and blood pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of blood pressure.</p>

<p>Unlike white and brown adipose tissues, the bone marrow adipocyte (BMA) exists in a microenvironment containing unique populations of hematopoietic and skeletal cells. To study this microenvironment at the sub-cellular level, we performed a three-dimensional analysis of the ultrastructure of the BMA niche with focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM). This revealed that BMAs display hallmarks of metabolically active cells including polarized lipid deposits, a dense mitochondrial network, and areas of endoplasmic reticulum. The distinct orientations of the triacylglycerol droplets suggest that fatty acids are taken up and/or released in three key areas - at the endothelial interface, into the hematopoietic milieu, and at the bone surface. Near the sinusoidal vasculature, endothelial cells send finger-like projections into the surface of the BMA which terminate near regions of lipid within the BMA cytoplasm. In some regions, perivascular cells encase the BMA with their flattened cellular projections, limiting contacts with other cells in the niche. In the hematopoietic milieu, BMAT adipocytes of the proximal tibia interact extensively with maturing cells of the myeloid/granulocyte lineage. Associations with erythroblast islands are also prominent. At the bone surface, the BMA extends organelle and lipid-rich cytoplasmic regions toward areas of active osteoblasts. This suggests that the BMA may serve to partition nutrient utilization between diverse cellular compartments, serving as an energy-rich hub of the stromal-reticular network. Lastly, though immuno-EM, we’ve identified a subset of bone marrow adipocytes that are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, providing an additional mechanism for regulation of the BMA. In summary, this work reveals that the bone marrow adipocyte is a dynamic cell with substantial capacity for interactions with the diverse components of its surrounding microenvironment. These local interactions likely contribute to its unique regulation relative to peripheral adipose tissues.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is cushion of fat tissue surrounding blood vessels, which is phenotypically different from other adipose tissue depots. PVAT is composed of adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction, constituted by different populations of immune cells, endothelial cells, and adipose-derived stromal cells. It expresses and releases an important number of vasoactive factors with paracrine effects on vascular structure and function. In healthy individuals, these factors elicit a net anticontractile and anti-inflammatory paracrine effect aimed at meeting hemodynamic and metabolic demands of specific organs and regions of the body. Pathophysiological situations, such as obesity, diabetes or hypertension, induce changes in its amount and in the expression pattern of vasoactive factors leading to a PVAT dysfunction in which the beneficial paracrine influence of PVAT is shifted to a pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, contractile, and trophic environment leading to functional and structural cardiovascular alterations and cardiovascular disease. Many different PVATs surrounding a variety of blood vessels have been described and exhibit regional differences. Both protective and deleterious influence of PVAT differs regionally depending on the specific vascular bed contributing to variations in the susceptibility of arteries and veins to vascular disease. PVAT therefore, might represent a novel target for pharmacological intervention in cardiovascular disease. © 2018 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 8:23-59, 2018.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high fructose intake associated with moderate increase in adiposity on rat arterial adrenergic responses and their modulation by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). After eight-week-lasting substitution of drinking water with 10 % fructose solution in adult normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), their systolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, and relative liver weight were elevated when compared to their respective control groups. Moreover, in SHR, body weight and relative heart weight were increased after treatment with fructose. In superior mesenteric arteries, PVAT exerted inhibitory influence on adrenergic contractile responses and this effect was markedly stronger in control WKY than in SHR. In fructose-administered WKY, arterial adrenergic contractions were substantially reduced in comparison with the control group; this was caused mainly by enhancement of anticontractile action of PVAT. The diminution of the mesenteric arterial contractions was not observed after fructose treatment in SHR. We conclude that the increase in body adiposity due to fructose overfeeding in rats might have prehypertensive effect. However, in WKY it might cause PVAT-dependent and independent reduction in arterial contractile responses to adrenergic stimuli, which could attenuate the pathological elevation in vascular tone.</p>

Thoracic aorta and tPVAT were removed from 16- to 17-week-old lean (LZR, n = 16) and obese Zucker rats (OZR, n = 16). The OZR presented with aortic endothelial dysfunction, assessed by wire myography, and increased aortic stiffness, assessed by elastic modulus.

<p>BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue plays a role in the storage of excess energy as triglycerides (TGs). Excess fat accumulation causes various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. It has been reported that ectopic fat deposition and excess TG accumulation in non-adipose tissue might be important predictors of cardiometabolic and vascular risk. For example, ectopic fat in perivascular tissue promotes atherosclerotic plaque formation in the arterial wall.OBJECTIVE: Recently, it has been reported that ectopic fat (adipocyte) in the vascular wall of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is present in both human and experimental animal models. The pathological significance of adipocytes in the AAA wall has not been fully understood. In this review, we summarized the functions of adipocytes and discussed potential new drugs that target vascular adipocytes for AAA treatment.RESULT: Previous studies suggest that adipocytes in vascular wall play an important role in the development of AAA.CONCLUSION: Adipocytes in the vascular wall could be novel targets for the development of AAA therapeutic drugs.</p>

<p>In rodents, experimentally-induced ovarian hormone deficiency increases adiposity and adipose tissue (AT) inflammation, which is thought to contribute to insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, whether this occurs in a translationally-relevant large animal model remains unknown. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that ovariectomy would promote visceral and perivascular AT (PVAT) inflammation, as well as subsequent insulin resistance and peripheral vascular dysfunction in female swine. At sexual maturity (7 months of age), female Yucatan mini-swine either remained intact (control, n = 9) or were ovariectomized (OVX, n = 7). All pigs were fed standard chow (15-20 g/kg), and were euthanized 6 months post-surgery. Uterine mass and plasma estradiol levels were decreased by ~10-fold and 2-fold, respectively, in OVX compared to control pigs. Body mass, glucose homeostasis, and markers of insulin resistance were not different between control and OVX pigs; however, OVX animals exhibited greater plasma triglycerides and triglyceride:HDL ratio. Ovariectomy enhanced visceral adipocyte expansion, although this was not accompanied by brachial artery PVAT adipocyte expansion, AT inflammation in either depot, or increased systemic inflammation assessed by plasma C-reactive protein concentrations. Despite the lack of AT inflammation and insulin resistance, OVX pigs exhibited depressed brachial artery endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation, which was rescued with blockade of endothelin receptor A. Together, these findings indicate that in female Yucatan mini-swine, increased AT inflammation and insulin resistance are not required for loss of ovarian hormones to induce endothelial dysfunction.</p>

<p>Due to the increasing age of our society and a rise in engagement of young people in extreme and/or competitive sports, both tendinopathies and tendon ruptures present a clinical and financial challenge. Tendon has limited natural healing capacity and often responds poorly to treatments, hence it requires prolonged rehabilitation in most cases. Till today, none of the therapeutic options has provided successful long-term solutions, meaning that repaired tendons do not recover their complete strength and functionality. Our understanding of tendon biology and healing increases only slowly and the development of new treatment options is insufficient. In this review, following discussion on tendon structure, healing and the clinical relevance of tendon injury, we aim to elucidate the role of stem cells in tendon healing and discuss new possibilities to enhance stem cell treatment of injured tendon. To date, studies mainly apply stem cells, often in combination with scaffolds or growth factors, to surgically created tendon defects. Deeper understanding of how stem cells and vasculature in the healing tendon react to growth factors, common drugs used to treat injured tendons and promising cellular boosters could help to develop new and more efficient ways to manage tendon injuries.</p>

<p>Objective To analyze the role of adiponectin (APN) in the treatment of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with atherosclerosis (AS) and its possible mechanism. Methods Twenty male ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice were enrolled to establish AS model with high-fat diet, and then randomly divided into control group (saline, intraperitoneal injection, 4 weeks) and APN-treated group (25 µg/d, intraperitoneal injection, 4 weeks). HE staining, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, immunofluorescence, reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting were performed to analyze the effect of APN on ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice and the changes of related signaling pathways. Results Compared with the control group, the APN-treated group had smaller atheroma macular areas and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and TNF-a) in blood vessels. The APN-treated group had less inflammatory cell infiltration in perivascular adipose tissues than those of the control group. The APN-treated group had lower levels of CD86 and IL-1ß, but higher levels of CD206 and IL-10 in perivascular adipose tissues than those of the control group. Western blot analysis showed that APN treatment significantly increased the expression of p-STAT6 in perivascular adipose tissues as compared with that of the control group. Conclusion APN has a definitely therapeutic effect on ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and the possible mechanism may be associated with the induced macrophage polarization through STST6 signal in perivascular adipose tissues.</p>

<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise training on perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) function in thoracic aorta from rats fed a high-fat diet. Aortic vascular reactivity was performed in sedentary (SD), trained (TR), sedentary high-fat diet (SD-HF), and trained high-fat diet (TR-HF) male Wistar rats in the absence (PVAT-) or in the presence (PVAT+) of thoracic PVAT. We also measured circulatory concentrations of leptin and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), as well as the protein expressions of TNF-a receptor 1 (TNFR1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) on PVAT. In the SD-HF group, the body weight, epididymal fat pad, thoracic PVAT, circulatory triglycerides, insulin, leptin and TNF-a were increased when compared with the SD group, whereas exercise training reduced these values in TR-HF group. The relaxing response curves to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were not modified by either intervention (high-fat diet or exercise training) or the presence of PVAT. The presence of PVAT had an anti-contractile effect in response to serotonin in all groups. In SD-HF group, the increased magnitude of anti-contractile effects was in parallel with an up-regulation of iNOS protein expression in PVAT without alteration in TNFR1. Exercise training was effective in normalizing the vascular reactivity in rings PVAT+ and in reducing the iNOS protein expression. Exercise training prevented the PVAT-induced alteration in thoracic aorta from rats fed a high-fat diet.</p>

<p>Potassium channels play a pivotal role in the regulation of excitability in cells such as neurons, cardiac myocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. The KCNQ (Kv7) family of voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels hyperpolarizes the cell and stabilizes the membrane potential. Here, we outline how Kv7 channel activity may contribute to the development of the cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Questions and hypotheses regarding previous and future research have been raised. Alterations in the Kv7 channel may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pharmacological modification of Kv7 channels may represent a possible treatment for CVD in the future.</p>

<p>Nonhuman primates currently serve as the best experimental model for Lyme disease because of their close genetic homology with humans and demonstration of all three phases of disease after infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. We investigated the pathology associated with late disseminated Lyme disease (12 to 13 months after tick inoculation) in doxycycline-treated (28 days; 5 mg/kg, oral, twice daily) and untreated rhesus macaques. Minimal to moderate lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, with a predilection for perivascular spaces and collagenous tissues, was observed in multiple tissues, including the cerebral leptomeninges, brainstem, peripheral nerves from both fore and hind limbs, stifle synovium and perisynovial adipose tissue, urinary bladder, skeletal muscle, myocardium, and visceral pericardium. Indirect immunofluorescence assays that combined monoclonal (outer surface protein A) and polyclonal antibodies were performed on all tissue sections that contained inflammation. Rare morphologically intact spirochetes were observed in the brains of two treated rhesus macaques, the heart of one treated rhesus macaque, and adjacent to a peripheral nerve of an untreated animal. Borrelia antigen staining of probable spirochete cross sections was also observed in heart, skeletal muscle, and near peripheral nerves of treated and untreated animals. These findings support the notion that chronic Lyme disease symptoms can be attributable to residual inflammation in and around tissues that harbor a low burden of persistent host-adapted spirochetes and/or residual antigen.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds most large blood vessels and plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. PVAT releases various chemokines and adipocytokines, functioning in an endocrine and paracrine manner to regulate vascular signaling and inflammation. Mounting evidence suggests that PVAT plays an important role in atherosclerosis and hypertension; however, the role of PVAT in non-atherosclerotic vascular diseases, including neointimal formation, aortic aneurysm, arterial stiffness and vasculitis, has received far less attention. Increasing evidence suggests that PVAT responds to mechanical endovascular injury and regulates the subsequent formation of neointima via factors that promote smooth muscle cell growth, adventitial inflammation and neovascularization. Circumstantial evidence also links PVAT to the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms and vasculitic syndromes, such as Takayasu’s arteritis, where infiltration and migration of inflammatory cells from PVAT into the vascular wall may play a contributory role. Moreover, in obesity, PVAT has been implicated to promote stiffness of elastic arteries via the production of reactive oxygen species. This review will discuss the growing body of data and mechanisms linking PVAT to the pathogenesis of non-atherosclerotic vascular diseases in experimental animal models and in humans.</p>

<p>In the mature adult skeleton, new bone formation is normally restricted to regeneration of osseous tissue at sites of fracture. However, heterotopic ossification, or the formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, can occur within muscle, adipose, or fibrous connective tissue. Periarticular non-hereditary heterotopic ossification (NHHO) may occur after musculoskeletal trauma, following CNS injury, with certain arthropathies, or following injury or surgery that is often sustained in the context of age-related pathology. The histological mechanism of bone development in these forms of heterotopic ossification has thus far been uncharacterized. We performed a histological analysis of 90 bone specimens from 18 patients with NHHO secondary to defined precipitating conditions, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular accident, trauma without neurologic injury, and total hip or knee arthroplasty. All bone specimens revealed normal endochondral osteogenesis at heterotopic sites. We defined the order of sequence progression in NHHO lesion formation as occurring through six distinct histological stages: (1) perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, (2) lymphocytic migration into soft tissue, (3) reactive fibroproliferation, (4) neovascularity, (5) cartilage formation, and (6) endochondral bone formation. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of the predominant histopathological findings associated with multiple forms of NHHO and shows that they share a common mechanism of lesion formation.</p>

<p>Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, also known as Wilkie’s syndrome, is a rare vascular disease caused by the anomalous course of the superior mesenteric artery arising from the abdominal aorta with a smaller angle than the norm (&lt;22°). The reduced angle compresses the structures situated between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, such as the duodenum and left renal vein; this can determine painful crises, intestinal subocclusions, and left varicocele. This syndrome can be congenital or acquired. The acquired type is more common and is generally caused by reduced perivascular fat surrounding the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery; this form is common among anorexic patients that have had a rapid weight loss. We present the case of a female patient who suffered from repeated postprandial vomiting and who lost 12 kg in 4 months. B-mode ultrasound imaging revealed evidence of a reduced angle between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, as found in Wilkie’s syndrome. After diagnosis, the patient followed a high-calorie diet, and 2 months later an ultrasound scan proved the restoration of the aorto-mesenteric angle as a consequence of increased perivascular fat with regression of symptoms.La sindrome dell’arteria mesenterica superiore o sindrome di Wilkie è una patologia vascolare rara dovuta all’anomalo decorso dell’arteria mesenterica superiore che nasce dall’aorta addominale con un angolo ridotto rispetto alla norma (inferiore a 22°). L’angolazione ridotta provoca la compressione delle strutture che passano tra l’aorta e l’arteria mesenterica superiore, il duodeno e la vena renale sinistra; questo può determinare crisi dolorose, sub-occlusioni intestinali e varicocele sinistro. Questa sindrome può essere congenita o acquisita. La forma acquisita, più frequente, è dovuta in genere alla riduzione del pannicolo adiposo peri-vascolare che circonda l’aorta addominale e l’arteria mesenterica superiore; questa forma è comune soprattutto nei pazienti anoressici che hanno subito una rapida perdita di peso. Presentiamo un caso di una paziente affetta da crisi ripetute di vomito post-prandiale che ha subito una perdita di 12 kg in 4 mesi. Durante l’esame ecografico B-Mode si evidenziava una riduzione dell’angolo tra aorta ed arteria mesenterica superiore, tipico della sindrome di Wilkie. Successivamente la paziente ha eseguito una dieta ipercalorica e dopo due mesi l’ecografia dimostrava il ripristino dell’angolo aorto-mesenterico come conseguenza dell’aumento del grasso peri-vascolare con regressione dei sintomi.</p>

<p>Carotid and coronary artery disease are two major atherosclerotic conditions that have shown an increased prevalence in the last three decades that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Recent data have revealed that the development of the atherosclerotic plaque-the basic entity in both diseases-may share similar characteristics and mechanisms irrespective of the location site. Even though the biology of atherosclerotic process is similar, there are differences in plaque morphology and characteristics. Indeed, plaque erosion, calcified nodules, fibrous cap thickness and macrophage accumulation may be different in the setting of coronary and carotid artery disease. The perivascular adipose tissue surrounding the coronary arteries (but not carotids) could also affect plaque biology. In this review we focus on comparative the characteristics of both types of atherosclerotic plaques and summarize existing knowledge to provide useful conclusions about current and future treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Obesity is an emerging pandemic driven by consumption of a diet rich in fat and highly refined carbohydrates (a Western diet) and a sedentary lifestyle in both children and adults. There is mounting evidence that arterial stiffness in obesity is an independent and strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cognitive functional decline, and chronic kidney disease. Cardiovascular stiffness is a precursor to atherosclerosis, systolic hypertension, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, and impairment of coronary and cerebral flow. Moreover, premenopausal women lose the CVD protection normally afforded to them in the setting of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, and this loss of CVD protection is inextricably linked to an increased propensity for arterial stiffness. Stiffness of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix remodeling, perivascular adipose tissue inflammation, and immune cell dysfunction contribute to the development of arterial stiffness in obesity. Enhanced endothelial cortical stiffness decreases endothelial generation of nitric oxide, and increased oxidative stress promotes destruction of nitric oxide. Our research over the past 5 years has underscored an important role of increased aldosterone and vascular mineralocorticoid receptor activation in driving development of cardiovascular stiffness, especially in females consuming a Western diet. In this review the cellular mechanisms of obesity-associated arterial stiffness are highlighted.</p>

<p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds are being used for the clinical repair of soft tissue injuries. Although improved functional outcomes have been reported, ECM scaffolds show limited tissue specific remodeling response with concomitant deposition of fibrotic tissue. One plausible explanation is the regression of blood vessels which may be limiting the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients across the scaffold. Herein we develop a composite scaffold as a vasculo-inductive platform by integrating PEGylated platelet free plasma (PFP) hydrogel with a muscle derived ECM scaffold (m-ECM). In vitro, adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) seeded onto the composite scaffold differentiated into two distinct morphologies, a tubular network in the hydrogel, and elongated structures along the m-ECM scaffold. The composite scaffold showed a high expression of ITGA5, ITGB1, and FN and a synergistic up-regulation of ang1 and tie-2 transcripts. The in vitro ability of the composite scaffold to provide extracellular milieu for cell adhesion and molecular cues to support vessel formation was investigated in a rodent volumetric muscle loss (VML) model. The composite scaffold delivered with ASCs supported robust and stable vascularization. Additionally, the composite scaffold supported increased localization of ASCs in the defect demonstrating its ability for localized cell delivery. Interestingly, ASCs were observed homing in the injured muscle and around the perivascular space possibly to stabilize the host vasculature. In conclusion, the composite scaffold delivered with ASCs presents a promising approach for scaffold vascularization. The versatile nature of the composite scaffold also makes it easily adaptable for the repair of soft tissue injuries.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds when used for soft tissue repair is often accompanied by deposition of fibrotic tissue possibly due to limited scaffold vascularization, which limits the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients across the scaffold. Although a variety of scaffold vascularization strategies has been investigated, their limitations preclude rapid clinical translation. In this study we have developed a composite scaffold by integrating bi-functional polyethylene glycol modified platelet free plasma (PEGylated PFP) with adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) along with a muscle derived ECM scaffold (m-ECM). The composite scaffold provides a vasculo-inductive and an effective cell delivery platform for volumetric muscle loss.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are promising candidates for cell-based therapies. However, the lack of markers able to unequivocally identify these cells, the differential expression of cell surface molecules among stromal progenitors from different tissues and cellular alterations caused by culture are phenomena that need to be comprehensively addressed in order to improve ASC purification and consequently refine our knowledge about their function and therapeutic efficiency. In this study, we investigated the potential of CD271, a marker used for purification of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, on enriching ASCs from CD34<sup>+</sup> stromal cells of human adipose tissue. Putative ASC populations were sorted based on CD271 expression (CD45<sup>-</sup> CD31<sup>-</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> CD271<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>-</sup> CD31<sup>-</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> CD271<sup>-</sup> cells) and compared regarding their clonogenic efficiency, proliferation, immunophenotypic profile, and multilineage potential. To shed light on their native identity, we also interrogated the expression of key perivascular cell markers in freshly isolated cells. CD271<sup>-</sup> cells displayed twofold higher clonogenic efficiency than CD271<sup>+</sup> cells. Upon culture, the progeny of both populations displayed similar immunophenotypic profile and in vitro adipogenic and chondrogenic potentials, while CD271<sup>+</sup> cells produced more calcified extracellular matrix. Interestingly, uncultured freshly isolated CD271<sup>+</sup> cells displayed higher expression of pericyte-associated markers than CD271<sup>-</sup> cells and localized in the inner region of the perivascular wall. Our results demonstrate that cells with in vitro ASC traits can be obtained from both CD271<sup>+</sup> and CD271<sup>-</sup> stromal populations of human adipose tissue. In addition, gene expression profiling and in situ localization analyses indicate that the CD271<sup>+</sup> population displays a pericytic phenotype.</p>

<p>The internal thoracic artery (ITA) that differs from coronary artery (CA), rarely develops atherosclerosis. Understanding the mechanism underlying such a difference will help to pave a new way to the prevention and treatment of the disease. We hypothesize herein that the difference in susceptibility to atherosclerosis between CA and ITA is attributable to the heterogeneity of perivascular adipose tissues (PVATs) surrounding these two kinds of arteries, i.e. PVAT-CA and PVAT-ITA. We isolated PVAT from eight patients of coronary heart disease (CHD) and four non-CHD patients. Gene expression patterns were analyzed by using Agilent whole gene expression profile chips. By comparison between PVAT-CA and PVAT-ITA, we identified 2053 differentially expressed genes, of which 1042 were up-regulated and 1011 were down-regulated, respectively, in CHD group. KEGG pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that those differentially expressed genes related to inflammation, lipid metabolism and myocardial processes were particularly noted in the CHD group, but not in non-CHD. Several selected genes, including interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), serum amyloid A2 (SAA2), and Leptin were validated by real-time PCR analysis. The results showed that the expression levels of IL-1ß, IL-6, and Leptin were significantly higher in PVAT-CA than in PVAT-ITA (P = 0.016, 0.021, and 0.018) in CHD patients. Levels of TLR2, TIRAP, and SAA2 expression were also higher in PVAT-CA, however no significant difference was observed (P = 0.054, 0.092, and 0.058). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate differential gene expression patterns between PVAT-CA and PVAT-ITA, revealing a high heterogeneity in PVAT. Particularly, those genes related to inflammation, lipid metabolism and myocardial processes are differentially expressed in PVAT-CA and PVAT-ITA in CHD patients, suggesting an important role of PVAT in the development of coronary atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Rigorous nutritional care during early life leads to healthy adulthood. Cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, the most prevalent clinical challenges worldwide, are epidemiologically linked to poor nutritional habits throughout life. We aimed to understand whether postnatal overnutrition (PO) initiated during lactation affects metabolic markers and vascular function later in life. To test this hypothetical effect, we studied a PO Wistar rat model based on adjusting litter size at the third day of age to three pups and eight for the control group (C). Systemic parameters such as body weight and food intake were significantly increased in adult rats, measured up to 36 weeks. Moreover, fat mass, triglycerides, insulin and systolic blood pressure were all significantly increased in the PO group. Furthermore, we assessed whether these alterations would affect morphological and functional parameters in isolated vessels. Consistent with systemic alterations of the vasculature, contraction of thoracic aortic rings, determined by dose-response curves to norepinephrine (NE), was significantly reduced in PO rats. Histological stains revealed that the relative area of collagen was higher and the elastic fiber density was lower in the distal rings of PO rats. Altogether, our results highlight the critical importance of having a healthy neonatal nutrition to prevent harmful metabolic and vascular alterations during adulthood.</p>

<p>Cold panniculitis and perniosis are the most common cold-induced dermatologic disorders and are clinically characterized by indurated and erythematous nodules and plaques that develop at sites exposed to excessive cold and wet conditions. Cold panniculitis is most commonly seen in infants, but adult cases involving the thighs of equestrians are well known and have come to be known as equestrian cold panniculitis or equestrian perniosis. Recently, similar cases have been described in nonequestrian settings with the prolonged use of ice-packs or other cold-therapy devices. We describe the case of 51-year-old female patient who underwent recent arthroscopic shoulder surgery for repair of a rotator cuff tear and presented to the dermatology clinic for painful and erythematous nodules on her arm. A punch biopsy demonstrated a superficial and deep perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with some spillover into the superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue. Focal vacuolar changes along the basal layer of the epidermis with a few dyskeratotic keratinocytes were present. A mild increase in interstitial mucin was seen, but no significant papillary dermal edema. On clinical questioning she admitted to sustained use of icepacks on the injured shoulder postoperatively for up to 18 hours a day. Based on clinical and histopathologic features the diagnosis of ice-pack dermatosis was made. A review of cold-induced dermatoses is considered with a focus on the main histologic differential diagnoses.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue surrounding major arteries (Perivascular adipose tissue or PVAT) has long been thought to exist to provide vessel support and insulation. Emerging evidence suggests that PVAT regulates artery physiology and pathology, such as, promoting atherosclerosis development through local production of inflammatory cytokines. Yet the immune subtypes in PVAT that regulate inflammation are poorly characterized. B cells have emerged as important immune cells in the regulation of visceral adipose tissue inflammation and atherosclerosis. B cell-mediated effects on atherosclerosis are subset-dependent with B-1 cells attenuating and B-2 cells aggravating atherosclerosis. While mechanisms whereby B-2 cells aggravate atherosclerosis are less clear, production of immunoglobulin type M (IgM) antibodies is thought to be a major mechanism whereby B-1 cells limit atherosclerosis development. B-1 cell-derived IgM to oxidation specific epitopes (OSE) on low density lipoproteins (LDL) blocks oxidized LDL-induced inflammatory cytokine production and foam cell formation. However, whether PVAT contains B-1 cells and whether atheroprotective IgM is produced in PVAT is unknown. Results of the present study provide clear evidence that the majority of B cells in and around the aorta are derived from PVAT. Interestingly, a large proportion of these B cells belong to the B-1 subset with the B-1/B-2 ratio being 10-fold higher in PVAT relative to spleen and bone marrow. Moreover, PVAT contains significantly greater numbers of IgM secreting cells than the aorta. ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with B cell-specific knockout of the gene encoding the helix-loop-helix factor Id3, known to have attenuated diet-induced atherosclerosis, have increased numbers of B-1b cells and increased IgM secreting cells in PVAT relative to littermate controls. Immunostaining of PVAT on human coronary arteries identified fat associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs) harboring high numbers of B cells, and flow cytometry demonstrated the presence of T cells and B cells including B-1 cells. Taken together, these results provide evidence that murine and human PVAT harbor B-1 cells and suggest that local IgM production may serve to provide atheroprotection.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of early overnutrition (EON) on the expression of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) components in renal cortex, renal arteries and renal perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), as well as the vascular response of renal arteries to Angiotensin II (Ang II).METHODS AND RESULTS: On birth day litters were adjusted to twelve (L12-control) or three (L3-overfed) pups per mother. Half of the animals were sacrificed at weaning (21 days old) and the other half at 5 months of age. Ang II-induced vasoconstriction of renal artery segments increased in young overfed rats and decreased in adult overfed rats. EON decreased the gene expression of angiotensinogen (Agt), Ang II receptors AT1 and AT2 and eNOS in renal arteries of young rats, while it increased the mRNA levels of AT-2 and ET-1 in adult rats. In renal PVAT EON up-regulated the gene expression of COX-2 and TNF-a in young rats and the mRNA levels of renin receptor both in young and in adult rats. On the contrary, Ang II receptors mRNA levels were downregulated at both ages. Renal cortex of overfed rats showed increased gene expression of Agt in adult rats and of AT1 in young rats. However the mRNA levels of AT1 were decreased in the renal cortex of overfed adult rats.CONCLUSION: EON is associated with alterations in the vascular response of renal arteries to Ang II and changes in the gene expression of RAAS components in renal tissue.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT), aside from being an energy storage site, functions as a source of cytokines, adipokines and other vasoactive molecules. Dysfunctional AT contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease by shifting to a pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory phenotype. Perivascular AT (PVAT) is of particular importance to the development of vascular disease, due to its close proximity to the vascular wall. Molecules released from PVAT can exert both pro- and anti-contractile effects, the balance of which plays a role in controlling vascular tone. Recent evidence supports the existence of reciprocal, two-way interactions between PVAT and the vascular wall. Statins, with their pivotal role in cardiovascular disease prevention, have been shown to exert lipid-lowering independent, pleiotropic effects on the vascular wall, some of which may be mediated by modulatory effects on PVAT inflammation and secretome. These effects of statins provide a paradigm for the development of new therapeutic agents aimed at modulating PVAT function, as a novel treatment strategy against cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND Angiomyolipoma is a benign tumor composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, and adipose tissue and has been described as belonging to the group of tumors of perivascular epithelioid cell origin (PEComa), commonly found in the kidneys and strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis. Only a few cases of extra-renal angiomyolipoma have previously been reported in the literature, most commonly in the liver. Adrenal angiomyolipoma is very rare, is usually asymptomatic, and is often found incidentally, with only 14 previously reported cases identified in the literature. CASE REPORT We report two cases of adrenal angiomyolipoma that were identified by abdominal computed tomography (CT). The first case presented in a 36-year-old man and was an oval-shaped adrenal mass, measuring 5.2×4.2×3.1 cm. The second case presented in a 61-year-old woman and was a round-shaped mass measuring 8.6×9.5×8.1 cm. Both patients underwent adrenalectomy. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of benign angiomyolipoma composed of adipose tissues, blood vessels, and smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS We present two rare cases of adrenal angiomyolipoma. We have reviewed the literature and identified 14 other cases of adrenal angiomyolipoma, and discuss the clinical, radiological, and pathological features of this rare tumor.</p>

<p>The anti-contractile property of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is abolished through an endothelium-dependent pathway in obesity. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP)9 improved endothelial function by promoting endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The aims of this study were to investigate whether CTRP9 improves the anti-contractile effect of PVAT and protects against PVAT dysfunction in obese mice. The mice were treated with a high-fat diet with or without CTRP9 treatment. Thoracic aortas with or without PVAT (PVAT+ or PVAT-) were prepared, and concentration-dependent responses to phenylephrine were measured. Obese mice showed a significantly increased contractile response, which was suppressed by CTRP9 treatment both with and without PVAT. PVAT significantly reduced the anti-contractile effect in obese mice, which was partially restored by CTRP9 treatment. Treatment of the aortic rings (PVAT+) with inhibitors of AMP protein kinase (AMPK), Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) attenuated the beneficial effect of CTRP9 on PVAT. Similar results were observed when we pretreated the aortic rings with CTRP9 ex vivo. CTRP9 significantly enhanced the phosphorylation levels of AMPK, Akt and eNOS, and reduced superoxide production and TNF-a levels in PVAT from obese mice. Our study suggests that CTRP9 enhanced the anti-contractile effect of PVAT and improved PVAT function by activating the AMPK-eNOS pathway in obese mice.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Carotid extra-media thickness (EMT) encompasses arterial adventitia and perivascular adipose tissue (PAT). Adventitial remodeling and PAT may contribute independently to functional (stiffness) and structural (remodeling) changes in artery wall properties. Visceral adiposity may contribute to PAT, thereby affecting artery stiffness. We investigated the relationships between carotid artery stiffness, EMT, and visceral adiposity in young, healthy individuals.RESULTS: Separate stepwise multiple regression models demonstrated that carotid PP (ß = 0.205) and EMT (ß = 0.267) accounted for 12.6% of variance in ß-stiffness, while carotid PP (ß = 0.195) and SAD (ß = 0.226) accounted for 10.5% of variance in EMT (p &lt; 0.05). Mediation analyses revealed carotid PP partially mediated the relationship between a) EMT and ß-stiffness, and b) SAD and EMT (p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Carotid PP and EMT, but not IMT, are related to carotid ß-stiffness. Carotid PP and visceral adiposity (SAD) are related to EMT. Carotid PP partially mediates the association between a) EMT and carotid ß-stiffness, and b) SAD and EMT. Our findings suggest visceral adiposity may detrimentally affect subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease risk (carotid PP, EMT) and contribute to artery stiffness.</p>

<p>The insulin sensitizing glitazone drugs, rosiglitazone (ROS) and pioglitazone (PGZ) both have anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects and induce adipose tissue (fat) to produce the vaso-protective protein adiponectin. Stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia development often occurs after placement of arteriovenous synthetic grafts used for hemodialysis. This work was performed to characterize the in vitro and in vivo effects of ROS or PGZ incorporation in fat and to determine if fat/PGZ depots could decrease vascular hyperplasia development in a porcine model of hemodialysis arteriovenous graft stenosis. Powdered ROS or PGZ (6-6000µM) was mixed with fat explants and cultured. Drug release from fat was quantified by HPLC/MS/MS, and adiponectin and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels in culture media were measured by ELISA. The effect of conditioned media from the culture of fat with ROS or PGZ on i) platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-stimulated proliferation of human venous smooth muscle cells (SMC) was measured by a DNA-binding assay, and ii) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human monocyte release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) was assessed by ELISA. In a porcine model, pharmacokinetics of PGZ from fat depots transplanted perivascular to jugular vein were assessed by HPLC/MS/MS, and retention of the fat depot was monitored by MRI. A porcine model of synthetic graft placed between carotid artery and ipsilateral jugular vein was used to assess effects of PGZ/fat depots on vascular hyperplasia development. Both ROS and PGZ significantly induced the release of adiponectin and inhibited release of MCP-1 from the fat. TNF production from monocytes stimulated with LPS was inhibited 50-70% in the presence of media conditioned by fat alone or fat and either drug. The proliferation of SMC was inhibited in the presence of media conditioned by fat/ROS cultures. Fat explants placed perivascular to the external jugular vein were retained, as confirmed by MRI at one week after placement. PGZ was detected in the fat depot, in the external jugular vein wall and in adjacent tissue at clinically relevant levels, whereas levels in plasma were below detection. External jugular vein exposed to fat incorporated with PGZ had increased adiponectin expression compared to vein exposed to fat alone. However, the development of hyperplasia within the arteriovenous synthetic grafts was unchanged by treatment with fat/PGZ depots compared to no treatment.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction, characterized by loss of its homeostatic functions, is a hallmark of non-communicable diseases. It is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation and is observed in obesity, metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and diabetes. While classically it has been identified by increased cytokine or chemokine expression, such as increased MCP-1, RANTES, IL-6, interferon (IFN) gamma or TNFa, mechanistically, immune cell infiltration is a prominent feature of the dysfunctional AT. These immune cells include M1 and M2 macrophages, effector and memory T cells, IL-10 producing FoxP3+<U+2009>T regulatory cells, natural killer and NKT cells and granulocytes. Immune composition varies, depending on the stage and the type of pathology. Infiltrating immune cells not only produce cytokines but also metalloproteinases, reactive oxygen species, and chemokines that participate in tissue remodelling, cell signalling, and regulation of immunity. The presence of inflammatory cells in AT affects adjacent tissues and organs. In blood vessels, perivascular AT inflammation leads to vascular remodelling, superoxide production, endothelial dysfunction with loss of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, contributing to vascular disease, atherosclerosis, and plaque instability. Dysfunctional AT also releases adipokines such as leptin, resistin, and visfatin that promote metabolic dysfunction, alter systemic homeostasis, sympathetic outflow, glucose handling, and insulin sensitivity. Anti-inflammatory and protective adiponectin is reduced. AT may also serve as an important reservoir and possible site of activation in autoimmune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. Thus, reciprocal regulation between immune cell infiltration and AT dysfunction is a promising future therapeutic target.</p>

<p>Vascular dysfunction and impaired endothelial mediated relaxation are powerful underlying abnormalities in the pathogenesis of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other metabolic abnormalities are associated with activation of mineralocorticoid receptor (MRs) in the vasculature and adipose tissue. While MR signaling is involved in the normal physiological differentiation and maturation of adipocyte, enhanced activation of MRs also contributes to increase oxidative stress, release of pro-inflammatory adipokines, and dysregulation of adipocyte autophagy. This, in turn, increases the maladaptive expansion of subcutaneous, visceral and perivascular adipose tissue, resulting in systemic and cardiovascular (CV) insulin resistance and increased CV stiffness and impaired vascular and cardiac relaxation. This review summarizes the normal role of MR activation in adipose tissues and explores the mechanisms by which excessive MR activation mediates adipose tissue inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Potential preventative and therapeutic strategies directed in the prevention of MR activation and CV disease are also discussed.</p>

<p>Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have enormous potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, until now, their development for clinical use has been severely limited as they are a mixed population of cells with varying capacities for lineage differentiation and tissue formation. Here, we identify receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) as a cell surface marker expressed by those MSCs with an enhanced capacity for cartilage formation. We generated clonal human MSC populations with varying capacities for chondrogenesis. ROR2 was identified through screening for upregulated genes in the most chondrogenic clones. When isolated from uncloned populations, ROR2+ve MSCs were significantly more chondrogenic than either ROR2-ve or unfractionated MSCs. In a sheep cartilage-repair model, they produced significantly more defect filling with no loss of cartilage quality compared with controls. ROR2+ve MSCs/perivascular cells were present in developing human cartilage, adult bone marrow, and adipose tissue. Their frequency in bone marrow was significantly lower in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) than in controls. However, after isolation of these cells and their initial expansion in vitro, there was greater ROR2 expression in the population derived from OA patients compared with controls. Furthermore, osteoarthritis-derived MSCs were better able to form cartilage than MSCs from control patients in a tissue engineering assay. We conclude that MSCs expressing high levels of ROR2 provide a defined population capable of predictably enhanced cartilage production. Stem Cells 2017;35:2280-2291.</p>

<p>We tested the hypothesis that hesperidin would reverse age-related aortic stiffness, perivascular adipose (PVAT) mediated-arterial stiffening and PVAT advanced glycation end-products (AGE) accumulation. Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and intrinsic mechanical stiffness, two measures of arterial stiffness, were assessed in C57BL/6 mice that were young (6months), old (27-29months), or old treated with hesperidin for 4weeks. Old compared with young mice had increased aPWV (444±10 vs. 358±8cm/s, P&lt;0.05) and mechanical stiffness (6506±369 vs. 3664±414kPa, P&lt;0.05). In old mice hesperidin reduced both aPWV (331±38cm/s) and mechanical stiffness (4445±667kPa) to levels not different from young. Aortic segments from old animals cultured with (+) PVAT had greater mechanical stiffness compared to young (+) PVAT (6454±323 vs. 3575±440kPa, P&lt;0.05) that was ameliorated in arteries from old hesperidin treated cultured (+) PVAT (2639±258kPa). Hesperidin also reversed the aging-related PVAT AGE accumulation (all, P&lt;0.05). A 4-week treatment with the AGE inhibitor aminoguanidine reversed both the age-related increase in aPWV (390±7cm/s) and mechanical stiffness (3396±1072kPa), as well as mechanical stiffness in arteries cultured (+) PVAT (3292±716kPa) (all, P&lt;0.05) to values not different from young. In conclusion, hesperidin ameliorates the age-related increase in aortic stiffness and the PVAT-mediated effects on arterial stiffening. Hesperidin also reversed PVAT AGE accumulation, where PVAT AGE were shown to promote aortic stiffness with aging.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular fat (CF) is associated with greater coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Postmenopausal women have greater CF volumes than premenopausal women, and the association between specific CF depot volumes and CHD risk is more pronounced after menopause. Race, central adiposity, and visceral adiposity are important factors that could impact CF volumes. Whether racial differences in CF volumes and in their associations with central (visceral fat [VAT]) and general adiposity (body mass index [BMI]) exist in midlife women have not been addressed before.METHODS: In all, 524 participants from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (mean age: 50.9<U+200A>±<U+200A>2.9 years; 62% White and 38% Black) who had data on CF volumes (epicardial fat [EAT], paracardial fat [PAT], total heart fat, and aortic perivascular fat), VAT, and BMI were studied.RESULTS: In models adjusted for age, study site, menopausal status, comorbid conditions, alcohol consumption, and physical activity, Black women had 19.8% less EAT, 24.5% less PAT, 20.4% less total heart fat, and 13.2% less perivascular fat than White women (all P<U+200A>&lt;<U+200A>0.001). These racial differences remained significant after additional adjustment for BMI or VAT. Race significantly modified associations between adiposity measures and CF volumes. Every 1-SD higher BMI was associated with 66.7% greater PAT volume in White compared with 42.4% greater PAT volume in Black women (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.004), whereas every 1-SD higher VAT was associated with 32.3% greater EAT volume in Black compared with 25.3% greater EAT volume in White women (P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.039).CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences were found in CF volumes and in their associations with adiposity measures among midlife women. Future research should determine how race-specific changes in CF volumes impact CHD risk in women.</p>

<p>Obesity and diabetes are strongly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disorders including dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure. Adipose tissue is identified as a complex endocrine organ, which by exerting a wide array of regulatory functions at the cellular, tissue and systemic levels can have profound effects on the cardiovascular system. Different terms including “epicardial,” “pericardial,” and “paracardial” have been used to describe adipose tissue deposits surrounding the heart. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a unique and multifaceted fat depot with local and systemic effects. The functional and anatomic proximity of EAT to the myocardium enables endocrine, paracrine, and vasocrine effects on the heart. EAT displays a large secretosome, which regulates physiological and pathophysiological processes in the heart. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) secretes adipose-derived relaxing factor, which is a “cocktail” of cytokines, adipokines, microRNAs, and cellular mediators, with a potent effect on paracrine regulation of vascular tone, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, atherosclerosis-susceptibility, and restenosis. Although there are various physiological functions of the EAT and PVAT, a phenotypic transformation can lead to a major pathogenic role in various cardiovascular diseases. The equilibrium between the physiological and pathophysiological properties of EAT is very delicate and susceptible to the influences of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Various adipokines secreted from EAT and PVAT have a profound effect on the myocardium and coronary arteries; targeting these adipokines could be an important therapeutic approach to counteract cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is one of the most important risk factors of atherosclerosis, which can induce endothelial injury. Meanwhile, adipocytes are the main cell type of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), the largest endocrine and paracrine organ and direct anatomical connection to adventitia, which may play a key role in the injury of endothelial cells. We used nicotine to induce dysfunctional HUVECs and adipocytes. In addition, we used a novel model to co-culture HUVECs and adipocytes in vitro by the transwell co-culture system to determine the effect of adipocytes on endothelial injury. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC. Genes and proteins involved in the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B) signaling pathway were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. We also investigated the nuclear translocation of NF-<U+03BA>B p65 using immunofluorescence staining. Our results showed that nicotine dose-dependently induces the apoptosis of HUVECs and adipocytes and is associated with increased IKKß and NF-<U+03BA>B p65 expression and with IkBa degradation. Meanwhile through the co-culture system, adipocytes promoted the expression of IKKß and NF-<U+03BA>B p65, as well as the translocation of NF-<U+03BA>B p65, and they accelerated the degradation of IkBa, resulting in increased apoptosis of HUVECs compared with that of the single cultured system. In conclusion, adipocytes could promote endothelial injury via the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway. Moreover, the NF-<U+03BA>B pathway plays pivotal roles in nicotine-induced vascular injury.</p>

<p>Expansion of Perivascular Adipose Tissue (PVAT), a major regulator of vascular function through paracrine signaling, is directly related to the development of hypertension during obesity. The extent of hypertrophy and hyperplasia depends on depot location, sex, and the type of Adipocyte Progenitor Cell (APC) phenotypes present. Techniques used for APC and preadipocytes isolation in the last 10 years have drastically improved the accuracy at which individual cells can be identified based on specific cell surface markers. However, isolation of APC and adipocytes can be a challenge due to the fragility of the cell, especially if the intact cell must be retained for cell culture applications. Magnetic-activated Cell Sorting (MCS) provides a method of isolating greater number of viable APC per weight unit of adipose tissue. APC harvested by MCS can be used for in vitro protocols to expand preadipocytes and differentiate them into adipocytes through use of growth factor cocktails allowing for analysis of the prolific and adipogenic potential retained by the cells. This experiment focused on the aortic and mesenteric PVAT depots, which play key roles in the development of cardiovascular disease during expansion. These protocols describe methods to isolate, expand, and differentiate a defined population of APC. This MCS protocol allows isolation to be used in any experiment where cell sorting is needed with minimal equipment or training. These techniques can aid further experiments to determine the functionality of specific cell populations based on the presence of cell surface markers.</p>

<p>Early detection of vascular inflammation would allow deployment of targeted strategies for the prevention or treatment of multiple disease states. Because vascular inflammation is not detectable with commonly used imaging modalities, we hypothesized that phenotypic changes in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) induced by vascular inflammation could be quantified using a new computerized tomography (CT) angiography methodology. We show that inflamed human vessels release cytokines that prevent lipid accumulation in PVAT-derived preadipocytes in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. We developed a three-dimensional PVAT analysis method and studied CT images of human adipose tissue explants from 453 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, relating the ex vivo images with in vivo CT scan information on the biology of the explants. We developed an imaging metric, the CT fat attenuation index (FAI), that describes adipocyte lipid content and size. The FAI has excellent sensitivity and specificity for detecting tissue inflammation as assessed by tissue uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in positron emission tomography. In a validation cohort of 273 subjects, the FAI gradient around human coronary arteries identified early subclinical coronary artery disease in vivo, as well as detected dynamic changes of PVAT in response to variations of vascular inflammation, and inflamed, vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques during acute coronary syndromes. Our study revealed that human vessels exert paracrine effects on the surrounding PVAT, affecting local intracellular lipid accumulation in preadipocytes, which can be monitored using a CT imaging approach. This methodology can be implemented in clinical practice to noninvasively detect plaque instability in the human coronary vasculature.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: The underlying mechanism of atherosclerosis and visceral obesity remains unknown.The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that atherosclerosis and visceral obesity are caused by an immune response to native plasma lipoproteins, and the atherogenic and adipogenic effects of the antibodies to native lipoproteins stem from the androgen deficiency that is created.METHODS: Wistar rats were immunized with native human (nh) low-density (LDL) or high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Visceral fat, aortic wall structure, and testosterone levels were studied.RESULTS: Immunization with nhLDL or nhHDL induced in rats increased visceral abdominal fat and perivascular adipose tissue volume, the appearance of epicardial fat, and atherosclerosis-like changes in the aortic wall: accumulation of leucocytes, destruction of the intima, and disruption of the media structure. Immunized rats produced antibodies to native plasma lipoproteins, while there was no difference between immunized and adjuvant-injected rats with regard to the level of antibodies to oxidized LDL. The immune response to nhHDL caused testosterone disturbances, but it is not associated with visceral obesity and atherosclerosis.CONCLUSION: The immune response to native lipoproteins is atherogenic and adipogenic and testosterone is not involved in the atherogenic and adipogenic effects of antibodies to lipoproteins.</p>

<p>Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) has been revealed as an adipokine with potential relevance in cardiovascular disease (CVD), while clinically used DPP-IV inhibitors have demonstrated beneficial cardiovascular effects in several experimental studies. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a unique adipose tissue depot in close anatomical proximity and bidirectional functional interaction with the vascular wall, which is a source of DPP-IV and its biology may be influenced by DPP-IV inhibition. Recently, DPP-IV inhibition has been associated with decreased local inflammation and oxidative stress both in the vascular wall and the PVAT, potentially regulating atherogenesis progression in vivo. DPP-IV inhibition may thus be a promising target in cardiovascular disease. However, the exact pleiotropic mechanisms that underlie the cardiovascular effects of DPP-IV inhibition need to be clarified, while the in vivo benefit of DPP-IV inhibition in humans remains unclear.</p>

<p>Human perivascular stem/stromal cells (PSC) are a multipotent mesodermal progenitor cell population defined by their perivascular residence. PSC are most commonly derived from subcutaneous adipose tissue, and recent studies have demonstrated the high potential for clinical translation of this fluorescence-activated cell sorting-derived cell population for bone tissue engineering. Specifically, purified PSC induce greater bone formation than unpurified stroma taken from the same patient sample. In this study, we examined the differences in early innate immune response to human PSC or unpurified stroma (stromal vascular fraction [SVF]) during the in vivo process of bone formation. Briefly, SVF or PSC from the same patient sample were implanted intramuscularly in the hindlimb of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice using an osteoinductive demineralized bone matrix carrier. Histological examination of early inflammatory infiltrates was examined by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining (Ly-6G, F4/80). Results showed significantly greater neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrates within and around SVF in comparison to PSC-laden implants. Differences in early postoperative inflammation among SVF-laden implants were associated with reduced osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. Similar findings were recapitulated with PSC implantation in immunocompetent mice. Exaggerated postoperative inflammation was associated with increased IL-1a, IL-1ß, IFN-<U+03B3>, and TNF-a gene expression among SVF samples, and conversely increased IL-6 and IL-10 expression among PSC samples. These data document a robust immunomodulatory effect of implanted PSC, and an inverse correlation between host inflammatory cell infiltration and stromal progenitor cell-mediated ossification.</p>

<p>Atherosclerosis has been identified as a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial vessel wall. Accumulating evidence indicates that different cells from the tunica intima, media, adventitia, and perivascular adipose tissue not only comprise the intact and normal arterial vessel wall but also participate all in the inflammatory response of atherosclerosis via multiple intricate pathways. For instance, endothelial dysfunction has historically been considered to be the initiator of the development of atherosclerosis. The migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells also play a pivotal role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Additionally, the fibroblasts from the adventitia and adipocytes from perivascular adipose tissue have received considerable attention given their special functions that contribute to atherosclerosis. In addition, numerous types of cytokines produced by different cells from the arterial vessel wall, including endothelium-derived relaxing factors, endothelium-derived contracting factors, tumor necrosis factors, interleukin, adhesion molecules, interferon, and adventitium-derived relaxing factors, have been implicated in atherosclerosis. Herein, we summarize the possible roles of different cells from the entire arterial vessel wall in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Under physiological conditions, nitric oxide (NO) is produced in the vasculature mainly by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Experiments using gene-disrupted mice have demonstrated that eNOS has antihypertensive, antithrombotic, and antiatherosclerotic effects. Recent studies show that eNOS is expressed not only in the endothelium but also in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Resveratrol prevents eNOS uncoupling and upregulates eNOS expression and activity. These effects of resveratrol are well established for the eNOS enzyme in the endothelium. Interestingly, resveratrol also improves PVAT function. However, a causal role for eNOS in the effects of resveratrol on PVAT function has not yet been verified and needs to be studied in the future.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Obesity-induced hypertension (OIH) has a high morbidity and mortality, and its prevention and treatment has been a major challenge in clinical practice. Chemerin is a newly discovered adipokine closely related to OIH.METHODS: Male Wistar rats (8W) were divided into either a high-fat diet or a regular diet group. Body weight and blood pressure were measured every two weeks. After 20 weeks, serum, adipose tissue and aortic arteries were collected. Arterial tensions were detected; Immunohistochemistry, ELISA and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of chemerin, CMKLR1, Rock2 and P-MYPT1 in the aorta and perivascular adipose tissues.CONCLUSION: OIH positively correlated with chemerin in tissues but not serum. Arterial tension was increased by chemerin 9. Rock2/P-MYPT1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of increased vascular tone in OIH rats.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in part due to vascular abnormalities such as endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening. The hypertension and other health complications that arise from these vascular defects increase the risk of heart diseases and stroke. Prooxidant and proinflammatory signaling pathways as well as adipocyte-derived factors have emerged as critical mediators of obesity-associated vascular abnormalities. Designing treatments aimed specifically at improving the vascular dysfunction caused by obesity may provide an effective therapeutic approach to prevent the cardiovascular sequelae associated with excessive adiposity. In this review, we discuss the recent evidence supporting the role of oxidative stress and cytokines and inflammatory signals within the vasculature as well as the impact of the surrounding perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on the regulation of vascular function and arterial stiffening in obesity. In particular, we focus on the highly plastic nature of the vasculature in response to altered oxidant and inflammatory signaling and highlight how weight management can be an effective therapeutic approach to reduce the oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling and improve vascular function.</p>

<p>Vascular oxidative stress plays a crucial role in atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent evidence suggests that vascular redox state is under the control of complex pathophysiological mechanisms, ranging from inflammation to obesity and insulin resistance (IR). Recent Advances: Adipose tissue (AT) is now recognized as a dynamic endocrine and paracrine organ that secretes several bioactive molecules, called adipokines. AT has recently been shown to regulate vascular redox state in both an endocrine and a paracrine manner through the secretion of adipokines, therefore providing a mechanistic link for the association between obesity, IR, inflammation, and vascular disease. Importantly, AT behaves as a sensor of cardiovascular oxidative stress, modifying its secretory profile in response to cardiovascular oxidative injury.</AbstractText>: Vascular oxidative stress plays a crucial role in atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

<p>Adipose progenitor cells (APCs) reside in a vascular niche, located within the perivascular compartment of adipose tissue blood vessels. Yet, the signals and mechanisms that govern adipose vascular niche formation and APC niche interaction are unknown. Here we show that the assembly and maintenance of the adipose vascular niche is controlled by PPAR<U+03B3> acting within APCs. PPAR<U+03B3> triggers a molecular hierarchy that induces vascular sprouting, APC vessel niche affinity and APC vessel occupancy. Mechanistically, PPAR<U+03B3> transcriptionally activates PDGFRß and VEGF. APC expression and activation of PDGFRß promotes the recruitment and retention of APCs to the niche. Pharmacologically, targeting PDGFRß disrupts APC niche contact thus blocking adipose tissue expansion. Moreover, enhanced APC expression of VEGF stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and expands the adipose niche. Consequently, APC niche communication and retention are boosted by VEGF thereby impairing adipogenesis. Our data indicate that APCs direct adipose tissue niche expansion via a PPAR<U+03B3>-initiated PDGFRß and VEGF transcriptional axis.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), surrounding arteries is metabolically active. Obesity and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may cause pathophysiological conditions in the aortic wall and surrounding PVAT. The aim of the study was to determine the histological effects on the aortic wall, aortic PVAT adipocyte morphology and leptin staining intensity in obese rats treated with ART. Wistar rats (N=36) were divided into four groups; a lean control (C/ART-), ART control (C/ART+), high-calorie diet (HCD) untreated (HCD/ART-) and HCD and ART experimental (HCD/ART+). The aorta and surrounding PVAT were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and anti-leptin antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The C/ART+ group had a thinner tunica media compared to the HCD/ART- group. The tunica adventitia was thicker in the ART groups (C/ART+ and HCD/ART+) compared to the lean control group. White adipocytes in the HCD/ART- group was larger in size compared to the other three groups. The high-calorie diet groups (HCD/ART- and HCD/ART+) had increased adipocyte sizes, for both brown and differentiating adipocytes, compared to the control groups (C/ART- and C/ART+). The unilocular and differentiating adipocytes in the C/ART+ group showed intense leptin staining. Unilocular and differentiating adipocytes in the HCD/ART- and HCD/ART+ groups showed weak to no leptin staining intensity. The present study indicated that ART and a HCD, separately and combined, altered both the tunica media and adventitia of the aortic wall, whereas the HCD alone caused adipocytes to increase in size. The leptin staining intensity suggested that ART alone may lead to increased leptin expression, whereas ART combined with a HCD may cause leptin deficiency. Changes seen with ART in a rat model suggest that aortic wall thickness and PVAT adipocyte morphology alterations should be considered by clinicians in obese individuals receiving ART.</p>

<p>Perivascular fat, the cushion of adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels, possesses dilator, anti-contractile and constrictor actions. The majority of these effects have been demonstrated in vitro and may depend on the vessel and/or the experimental method or species used. In general, the relaxant effect of perivascular adipose tissue is local and may be either endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent. However, nerve stimulation studies show that, in general, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has an anti-contractile vascular effect likely to involve an action of the autonomic vascular nerves. Apart from a direct effect of perivascular fat-derived factors on bypass conduits, an interaction with a number of neurotransmitters and other agents may play an important role in graft performance. Although the vascular effects of PVAT are now well-established there is a lack of information regarding the role and/or involvement of peripheral nerves including autonomic nerves. For example, are perivascular adipocytes innervated and does PVAT affect neuronal control of vessels used as grafts? To date there is a paucity of electrophysiological studies into nerve-perivascular fat control. This review provides an overview of the vascular actions of PVAT, focussing on its potential relevance on blood vessels used as bypass grafts. In particular, the anatomical relationship between the perivascular nerves and fat are considered and the role of the perivascular-nerve/fat axis in the performance of bypass grafts is also discussed.</p>

<p>AIMS: To determine whether irisin could improve endothelial dysfunction by regulating heme oxygenase-1(HO-1)/adiponectin axis in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in obesity.METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without irisin treatment. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of the thoracic aorta with or without PVAT (PVAT+ or PVAT-) was determined. Western blot was employed to determine the levels of HO-1 and adiponectin in PVAT. UCP-1, Cidea, and TNF-a gene expression in PVAT were tested by real-time PCR.RESULTS: The presence of PVAT significantly impaired endothelial function in the HFD mice. Treatment of HFD mice with irisin significantly restored this impairment and improved endothelial function in vivo or ex vivo. Incubated aortic rings (PVAT-) with PVAT-derived conditioned medium (CM) from HFD mice impaired endothelial function in control mice. This impairment was prevented by incubating the aortic rings (PVAT-) from HFD mice with PVAT-derived CM from irisin. However, the beneficial effects were partly attenuated in the presence of HO-1 inhibitor and adiponectin receptor blocking peptide. Treatment of HFD mice with irisin significantly increased NO production, protein levels of HO-1 and adiponectin, mRNA expressions of UCP-1 and Cidea, and decreased superoxide production and TNF-a expression in PVAT.CONCLUSION: Irisin improved endothelial function by modulating HO-1/ adiponectin axis in PVAT in HFD-induced obese mice. These findings suggest that regulating PVAT function may be a potential mechanism by which irisin improves endothelial function in obesity.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As there is sexual dimorphism in the regulation of vascular tone, the aim of this present study was to determine whether there are sex differences in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-mediated regulation of the porcine coronary artery (PCA) tone.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Isometric tension recording system was used to record changes in tone in PCAs. Western blot analysis was performed to examine the expression of adiponectin in PVAT and adiponectin receptors and adiponectin binding protein (APPL1) in PCA. The level of adiponectin released from PVAT was measured using elisa.KEY RESULTS: In the presence of adherent PVAT, contractions to the thromboxane mimetic U46619 and endothelin-1 were significantly reduced in PCAs from females, but not males. In PCAs pre-contracted with U46619, re-addition of PVAT caused relaxation in PCAs from females, but not males. This relaxant response in females was attenuated by combined inhibition of NOS (with L-NAME) and COX (with indomethacin). Pre-incubation with an anti-adiponectin antibody abolished the relaxant effects of PVAT. The adiponectin receptor agonist (adipoRon) produced a greater relaxation in PCAs from females compared with males. However, there was no difference in either the expression or release of adiponectin from PVAT between sexes. Similarly, there was no difference in the expression of adiponectin receptors or the adiponectin receptor adaptor protein APPL1 in PCAs.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings demonstrate a clear sex difference in the regulation of coronary arterial tone in response to adiponectin receptor stimulation, which may underlie the anticontractile effects of PVAT in females.</p>

<p>Chronic inflammatory state in obesity causes dysregulation of the endocrine and paracrine actions of adipocyte-derived factors, which disrupt vascular homeostasis and contribute to endothelial vasodilator dysfunction and subsequent hypertension. While normal healthy perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) ensures the dilation of blood vessels, obesity-associated PVAT leads to a change in profile of the released adipo-cytokines, resulting in a decreased vasorelaxing effect. Adipose tissue inflammation, nitric oxide (NO)-bioavailability, insulin resistance and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) are main participating factors in endothelial dysfunction of obesity. In this chapter, disruption of inter-endothelial junctions between endothelial cells, significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation mediators, which are originated from inflamed endothelial cells, the balance between NO synthesis and ROS , insulin signaling and NO production, and decrease in L-arginine/endogenous asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA) ratio are discussed in connection with endothelial dysfunction in obesity.</p>

<p>Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, clinical research has revealed a paradoxically protective role for obesity in patients with chronic diseases including CVD, suggesting that the biological ‘quality’ of adipose tissue (AT) may be more important than overall AT mass or body weight. Importantly, AT is recognised as a dynamic organ secreting a wide range of biologically active adipokines, microRNAs, gaseous messengers, and other metabolites that affect the cardiovascular system in both endocrine and paracrine ways. Despite being able to mediate normal cardiovascular function under physiological conditions, AT undergoes a phenotypic shift characterised by acquisition of pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory properties in cases of CVD. Crucially, recent evidence suggests that AT depots such as perivascular AT and epicardial AT are able to modify their phenotype in response to local signals of vascular and myocardial origin, respectively. Utilisation of this unique property of certain AT depots to dynamically track cardiovascular biology may reveal novel diagnostic and prognostic tools against CVD. Better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the ‘quality’ of AT secretome, as well as the communication links between AT and the cardiovascular system, is required for the efficient management of CVD.</p>

<p>To investigate whether haematopoietic TLR4 deletion attenuates perivascular brown adipose tissue inflammation in atherosclerotic mice.</AbstractText>: To investigate whether haematopoietic TLR4 deletion attenuates perivascular brown adipose tissue inflammation in atherosclerotic mice.Experiments were performed using irradiated LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR<sup>-/-</sup>) mice with marrow from either TLR4-deficient (TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>) or age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. After 12 weeks of being fed a high-cholesterol diet, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup><U+2192>LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed fewer atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta compared to WT<U+2192>LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This effect was associated with an increase in multilocular lipid droplets and mitochondria in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that there was an increase in capillary density and M2 macrophage infiltration, accompanied by a decrease in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a expression in the localized PVAT of TLR4<sup>-/-</sup><U+2192>LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In vitro studies indicated that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT mice demonstrated an M1-like phenotype and expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by palmitate. These effects were attenuated in BMDMs isolated from TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Furthermore, brown adipocytes incubated with conditioned medium (CM) derived from palmitate-treated BMDMs, exhibited larger and more unilocular lipid droplets, and reduced expression of brown adipocyte-specific markers and perilipin-1 compared to those observed in brown adipocytes exposed to CM from palmitate-treated BMDMs of TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This decreased potency was primarily due to TNF-a, as demonstrated by the capacity of the TNF-a neutralizing antibody to reverse these effects.</AbstractText>: mice.

<p>BACKGROUND: The pericytes in the blood vessel wall have recently been identified to be important in regulating vascular formation, stabilization, remodeling, and function. We isolated and identified pericyte-like platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta-positive (PDGFRß+) cells from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue from critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients and investigated their potential as a reliable source of stem cells for cell-based therapy.METHODS: De-identified subcutaneous fat tissues were harvested after amputation in CLI patients. Freshly isolated SVF cells and culture-expanded adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were quantified using flow cytometry. A matrigel tube formation assay and multi-lineage differentiation were performed to assess pericytic and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like characteristics of PDGFRß+ ADSCs.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, but the mechanisms underlying the link between increased body weight and vascular disease are incompletely understood. Over the past 15 years, perivascular adipose tissue has emerged as active component of the vessel wall involved in vascular homeostasis. However, perivascular adipose tissue can adopt detrimental properties under the influence of obesity and other factors and contribute actively to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. Conversely, changes of the vessel wall may negatively affect perivascular adipose tissue qualities. In this review, we will discuss the recent literature on the possible direct and indirect connections between perivascular fat alterations and cardiovascular pathologies. In addition to clinical evidence on the association between perivascular fat mass and morphology and anthropometric measures of obesity or the reciprocal connection between perivascular fat and cardiometabolic risk factors and disease, special emphasis will be placed on results in rodent and other models and the possible direct contribution of local fat depots to vascular dysfunction, neointima formation or atherosclerosis. We will briefly highlight results from human and murine genome, miRNome and proteome-wide expression analyses of potential candidate mediators involved in its paracrine activities and present data on how the cardiovascular risk factors obesity, age or diabetes, but also the preventive measures weight loss or exercise impact on perivascular expression patterns. A better understanding of this unique adipose tissue depot, its properties and regulatory mechanisms, may create opportunities for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat the cardiovascular consequences of increased body weight.</p>

<p>Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds the vascular wall, is associated with CVD risk factors, and may contribute to premature CVD in SLE. We previously found greater volumes of aortic PVAT associated with aortic calcification (AC) in female SLE patients. There is recent evidence that not only volume but adipose density may also be indicative of inflammation. We hypothesized that female SLE patients would have a difference in aPVAT quality associated with AC that is independent of volume.</AbstractText>: Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) is a highly heterogeneous organ. Beside the heterogeneity associated to different tissue types (white, brown, and ‘brite’) and its location-related heterogeneity (subcutaneous, visceral, epicardial, and perivascular, etc.), AT composition, structure, and functionality are highly dependent on individual-associated factors. As such, the pro-inflammatory state associated to the presence of obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) directly affects AT metabolism. Furthermore, the adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) that reside in the stromal vascular fraction of AT, besides being responsible for most of the plasticity attributed to AT, is an additional source of heterogeneity. Thus, ASCs directly contribute to AT homeostasis, cell renewal, and spontaneous repair. These ASCs share many properties with the bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (i.e. potential to differentiate towards multiple tissue lineages, and angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and immunomodulatory properties). Moreover, ASCs show clear advantages in terms of accessibility and quantity of available sample, their easy in vitro expansion, and the possibility of having an autologous source. All these properties point out towards a potential use of ASCs in regenerative medicine. However, the presence of obesity and other CVRFs induces a pro-inflammatory state that directly impacts ASCs proliferation and differentiation capacities affecting their regenerative abilities. The focus of this review is to summarize how inflammation affects the different AT depots and the mechanisms by which these changes further enhance the obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of obesity-induced inflammation on ASCs properties and how those effects impair their plasticity.</p>

<p>For over 15 years, human subcutaneous adipose tissue has been recognized as a rich source of tissue resident mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC). The isolation of perivascular progenitor cells from human adipose tissue by a cell sorting strategy was first published in 2008. Since this time, the interest in using pericytes and related perivascular stem/stromal cell (PSC) populations for tissue engineering has significantly increased. Here, we describe a set of experiments identifying, isolating and characterizing PSC from canine tissue (N = 12 canine adipose tissue samples). Results showed that the same antibodies used for human PSC identification and isolation are cross-reactive with canine tissue (CD45, CD146, CD34). Like their human correlate, canine PSC demonstrate characteristics of MSC including cell surface marker expression, colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) inclusion, and osteogenic differentiation potential. As well, canine PSC respond to osteoinductive signals in a similar fashion as do human PSC, such as the secreted differentiation factor NEL-Like Molecule-1 (NELL-1). Nevertheless, important differences exist between human and canine PSC, including differences in baseline osteogenic potential. In summary, canine PSC represent a multipotent mesenchymogenic cell source for future translational efforts in tissue engineering.</p>

<p>It is increasingly recognized that obesity is a risk factor for microvascular disease, involving both structural and functional changes in the microvasculature. This review aims to describe how obesity impacts the microvasculature of a variety of tissues, including visceral adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, kidneys, and lungs. These changes involve endothelial dysfunction, which in turn (i) impacts control of vascular tone, (ii) contributes to development of microvascular insulin resistance, (iii) alters secretion of paracrine factors like nitric oxide and endothelin, but (iv) also influences vascular structure and perivascular inflammation. In concert, these changes impair organ perfusion and organ function thereby contributing to altered release and clearance of neurohumoral factors, such as adipokines and inflammatory cytokines. Global microvascular dysfunction in obese subjects is therefore a common pathway that not only explains exercise-intolerance but also predisposes to development of chronic kidney disease, microvascular dementia, coronary microvascular angina, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary hypertension.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue is a remarkably expandable organ with results in the last decade showing that human white adipocytes are continuously turned over during the entire life-span. Data primarily in murine models have demonstrated that adipocytes are derived from precursors present mainly in the perivascular areas of adipose tissue but their precise origin remains unclear. Subsets of cells present in bone marrow display a multipotent differentiation capacity which has prompted the hypothesis that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) may also contribute to the adipocyte pool present in peripheral fat depots. This notion was initially demonstrated in a murine transplantation model, however, subsequent animal studies have been conflicting resulting in a debate of whether BMDCs actually differentiate into adipocytes or just fuse with resident fat cells. This controversy was recently resolved in 2 studies of human subjects undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Using a combination of different assays these data suggest that bone marrow contributes to at least 10% of the adipocyte pool. This proportion is doubled in obesity, suggesting that BMDCs may constitute a reserve pool for adipogenesis, particularly upon weight gain. This review discusses the possible mechanisms and relevance of these findings for human pathophysiology.</p>

<p>The physiologic function of adipose tissue is altered by the host’s inflammatory response; the implications for maintaining human health and regulating inflammation-associated disease progression are ill defined. However, this cannot be investigated in humans, therefore the use of animal models is required. With the aim to determine morphological and molecular alterations to perivascular and organ-associated adipose tissues during inflammatory arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was established in male DBA/1 mice. Emerging evidence from this study signposts CIA in the DBA/1 mouse as a model that is relevant to study the development and treatment of early cardiovascular pathology associated with inflammatory arthritis. Here, we show global morphological changes in adipose tissue and the thoracic aorta in animals induced with CIA compared with the non-immunized controls. In CIA, we concluded that the increased cell count in PVAT was, at least in part, caused by an ingress and/or expansion of macrophages that had a mixed phenotype. A substantial increase of galectin-3 was expressed in PVAT from mice with CIA. Galectin-3 is elevated in the blood of patients with CVDs, however, it has never before been measured in PVAT in rodents or humans. Here, PVAT-associated galectin-3 is identified as a potential biomarker for detecting early vascular pathology in CIA and a promising candidate for translation to RA.</p>

<p>In contrast to humans in which mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapies are still largely in the clinical trial phase, MSCs have been used therapeutically in horses for over 15 years, thus constituting a valuable preclinical model for humans. In human tissues, MSCs have been shown to originate from perivascular cells, namely pericytes and adventitial cells, which are identified by the presence of the cell surface markers CD146 and CD34, respectively. In contrast, the origin of MSCs in equine tissues has not been established, preventing the isolation and culture of defined cell populations in that species. Moreover, a comparison between perivascular CD146<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>+</sup> cell populations has not been performed in any species.</AbstractText>: cell populations has not been performed in any species.Immunohistochemistry was used to identify adventitial cells (CD34<sup>+</sup>) and pericytes (CD146<sup>+</sup>) and to determine their localization in relation to MSCs in equine tissues.

<p>Inflammatory changes, both in the arterial wall and adipose tissue, play a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis. We measured the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in adipose tissue (AT) of living kidney donors (LKD) and patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and flow cytometry analyses were performed in subcutaneous (SAT), visceral (VAT), and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Data of PAD patients showed significantly higher expression in VAT in all three genes (TNFalpha 5-fold, p&lt;0.05; MCP-1 3.6-fold, p&lt;0.05; IL-6 18.8-fold, p&lt;0.001). The differences in PVAT and SAT were less significant. Total body pro-inflammatory status was documented by higher TNFalpha concentration in patients (4.86+/-1.4 pg/ml) compared to LKDs (2.14+/-0.9 pg/ml; p&lt;0.001), as was hsCRP (11.8+/-7.0 in PAD; 1.5+/-0.48 in LKDs; p=0.017). We found no age-dependent relationship between gene expression vs. TNFalpha and hsCRP concentrations in both compared groups. No effect of the atherosclerosis score on gene expression and circulating inflammatory markers within the PAD group was observed. Our results suggest that the AT of PAD patients infiltrated with macrophages produces more cytokines involved in the development of inflammation and atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been used in human and equine regenerative medicine, and interest in exploiting their potential has increased dramatically over the years. Despite significant effort to characterize equine MSCs, the actual origin of these cells and how much of their native phenotype is maintained in culture have not been determined. In this study, we investigated the relationship between MSCs, derived from adipose tissue (AT) and bone marrow (BM), and pericytes in the horse. Both pericyte (CD146, NG2, and aSMA) and MSC (CD29, CD90, and CD73) markers were detected in equine AT and colocalized around blood vessels. Importantly, as assessed by flow cytometry, both pericyte (CD146, NG2, and aSMA) and MSC (CD29, CD44, CD90, and CD105) markers were present in a majority (=90%) of cells in cultures of AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs; however, levels of pericyte markers were variable within each of those populations. Moreover, the expression of pericyte markers was maintained for at least eight passages in both AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs. Hematopoietic (CD45) and endothelial (CD144) markers were also detected at low levels in MSCs by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Finally, in coculture experiments, AT-MSCs closely associated with networks produced by endothelial cells, resembling the natural perivascular location of pericytes in vivo. Our results indicate that equine MSCs originate from perivascular cells and moreover maintain a pericyte-like phenotype in culture. Therefore, we suggest that, in addition to classical MSC markers, pericyte markers such as CD146 could be used when assessing and characterizing equine MSCs.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which reduces vascular contractility, is dysfunctional in the male offspring of rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD), partially due to a reduced NO bioavailability. O-GlcNAcylation of eNOS decreases its activity, thus we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation in the prenatal programming of PVAT dysfunction. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a control (10% fat) or an obesogenic HFD (45% fat) diet for 12 weeks prior to mating, and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were weaned onto the control diet and were killed at 12 and 24 weeks of age. Mesenteric arteries from the 12-week-old offspring of HFD dams (HFDO) contracted less to U46619; these effects were mimicked by glucosamine in control arteries. PVAT from 12- and 24-week-old controls, but not from HFDO, exerted an anticontractile effect. Glucosamine attenuated the anticontractile effect of PVAT in the vessels from controls but not from HFDO. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation (with A769662) partially restored an anticontractile effect in glucosamine-treated controls and HFDO PVAT. Glucosamine decreased AMPK activity and expression in HFDO PVAT, although phosphorylated eNOS expression was only reduced in that from males. The loss of anticontractile effect of HFDO PVAT is likely to result from increased O-GlcNAcylation, which decreased AMPK activity and, in males, decreased NO bioavailability.</p>

<p>Electrical field stimulation (EFS) elicits robust sensory neurogenic relaxation responses in the rat isolated mesenteric arterial bed but these responses are absent or difficult to demonstrate in isolated arteries. We believe that this mismatch is due to the absence of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) as it is conventionally removed in studies on isolated vessels. We aimed to determine whether sensory nerves are expressed in PVAT, their physiological roles and their possible interactions with PVAT-derived adipokines.</AbstractText>: Electrical field stimulation (EFS) elicits robust sensory neurogenic relaxation responses in the rat isolated mesenteric arterial bed but these responses are absent or difficult to demonstrate in isolated arteries.

We aimed to determine whether sensory nerves are expressed in PVAT, their physiological roles and their possible interactions with PVAT-derived adipokines.Using confocal imaging, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), myography, vascular perfusion, and multiplex analysis of rat mesenteric arteries, we show that PVAT is crucial for the roles of sensory nerves in control of vasomotor tone and adipokine release. Immunofluorescence double staining showed co-expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; sensory neurotransmitter) and PGP9.5 (neuronal marker) in PVAT of mesenteric arteries. CGRP release from dissected PVAT, measured using EIA, was increased by capsaicin which activates sensory nerves. EFS in both mesenteric arteries and perfused mesenteric arterial beds, with and without PVAT, demonstrated neurogenic relaxation in the presence of PVAT, which was greatly attenuated in preparations without PVAT. Neurogenic relaxation due to EFS was associated with release of leptin in PVAT-intact mesenteric arterial beds, which was abolished in preparations without PVAT. Exposure to low oxygen was associated with an attenuated leptin and adiponectin release, but an increase in IL-6 release, from mesenteric arterial beds. Exogenous leptin augmented relaxation to CGRP in mesenteric arteries.</AbstractText>: Using confocal imaging, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), myography, vascular perfusion, and multiplex analysis of rat mesenteric arteries, we show that PVAT is crucial for the roles of sensory nerves in control of vasomotor tone and adipokine release.

<p>PURPOSE: Mangiferin is a naturally occurring glucosylxanthone with beneficial effects on glucose and lipid homeostasis. This study investigates the potential therapeutic effect of Mangiferin in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and whether it contributes to regulating insulin action in the endothelium.METHODS: Palmitate challenge evoked ROS-associated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in PVAT. The conditioned medium from PA-stimulated PVAT was prepared to induce endothelial insulin resistance, and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to insulin was detected in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: Mangiferin treatment enhanced LKB1-dependent AMPK activity and suppressed ER stress with downregulation of TXNIP induction, leading to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation evidenced by attenuated NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 expression as well as reduced IL-1ß secretion. Moreover, Mangiferin restored insulin-mediated Akt and eNOS phosphorylations with increased NO production, immunohistochemistry examination of adipocytes, and endothelial tissue in high-fat diet-fed mice also showed that oral administration of Mangiferin inhibited ER stress and NLRP3 induction in PVAT, and then effectively prevented insulin resistance in the vessel endothelium.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results revealed that Mangiferin suppressed ER stress-associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in PVAT through regulation of AMPK activity, which prevented endothelial insulin resistance. These findings suggested that the amelioration of PVAT dysfunction may be a therapeutic strategy for the prevention of endothelial insulin resistance.</p>

<p>Obesity is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, the mechanistic link between accumulation of adipose tissue and development of atherosclerosis is not clear. Adipose tissue comprises various depots including white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and thoracic and abdominal perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). The phenotype of thoracic PVAT resembles BAT, whereas abdominal PVAT is more like WAT. Here, we review the distinct roles of the adipose tissue depots in the development of atherosclerosis with the ultimate aim to understand how these can be targeted to reduce atherosclerosis. In obesity, increased fatty acid release by WAT and decreased lipid combustion by BAT and thoracic PVAT lead to hyperlipidaemia, which contributes to atherosclerosis development. Besides, obese WAT and abdominal PVAT release pro-inflammatory factors that further promote atherosclerosis. To discourage atherosclerosis development, strategies that reduce the release of pro-inflammatory factors and fatty acids from WAT and abdominal PVAT, or increase combustion of fatty acids by activation of BAT and thoracic PVAT and beiging of WAT are probably most efficient. Possible therapies could include anti-inflammatory compounds such as adiponectin and salicylates to lower inflammation, and ß3-adrenergic receptor activators to increase fatty acid combustion. Additional and more specific strategies to promote fatty acid combustion are currently subject of investigation. In conclusion, different adipose depots differentially affect atherosclerosis development, in which atherosclerosis is promoted by energy-storing adipose depots and attenuated by energy-combusting adipose tissue. In obesity, combining therapies that reduce inflammation and increase combustion of lipids are most conceivable to restrain atherogenesis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Innate antigen-presenting cells and adaptive immune T cells have been implicated in the development of hypertension. However, the T-lymphocyte subsets involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension remain unclear. A small subset of innate-like T cells expressing the <U+03B3>d T cell receptor (TCR) rather than the aß TCR could play a role in the initiation of the immune response in hypertension. We aimed to determine whether angiotensin (Ang) II caused kinetic changes in <U+03B3>d T cells; deficiency in <U+03B3>d T cells blunted Ang II-induced hypertension, vascular injury, and T-cell activation; and <U+03B3>d T cells are associated with human hypertension.CONCLUSIONS: <U+03B3>d T cells mediate Ang II-induced SBP elevation, vascular injury, and T-cell activation in mice. <U+03B3>d T cells might contribute to the development of hypertension in humans.</p>

<p>Obesity impairs the relaxant capacity of adipose tissue surrounding the vasculature (PVAT) and has been implicated in resultant obesity-related hypertension and impaired glucose intolerance. Resident immune cells are thought to regulate adipocyte activity. We investigated the role of eosinophils in mediating normal PVAT function. Healthy PVAT elicits an anti-contractile effect, which was lost in mice deficient in eosinophils, mimicking the obese phenotype, and was restored upon eosinophil reconstitution. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that the loss of PVAT function was due to reduced bioavailability of adiponectin and adipocyte-derived nitric oxide, which was restored after eosinophil reconstitution. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that adiponectin and nitric oxide are released after activation of adipocyte-expressed ß3 adrenoceptors by catecholamines, and identified eosinophils as a novel source of these mediators. We conclude that adipose tissue eosinophils play a key role in the regulation of normal PVAT anti-contractile function.</p>

<p>Hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are very rare. We report a primary hepatic PEComa with a review of the literature. A 56-year-old women presented with a nodular mass detected during the management of chronic renal failure and chronic hepatitis C. Diagnostic imaging studies suggested a nodular hepatocellular carcinoma in segment 5 of the liver. The patient underwent partial hepatectomy. A brown-colored expansile mass measuring 3.2×3.0 cm was relatively demarcated from the surrounding liver parenchyma. The tumor was mainly composed of epithelioid cells that were arranged in a trabecular growth pattern. Adipose tissue and thick-walled blood vessels were minimally identified. A small amount of extramedullary hematopoiesis was observed in the sinusoidal spaces between tumor cells. Tumor cells were diffusely immunoreactive for human melanoma black 45 (HMB45) and Melan A, focally immunoreactive for smooth muscle actin, but not for hepatocyte specific antigen (HSA).</p>

<p>Adipokines are bioactive molecules that regulate several physiological functions such as energy balance, insulin sensitization, appetite regulation, inflammatory response, and vascular homeostasis. They include proinflammatory cytokines such as adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as adiponectin, as well as vasodilator and vasoconstrictor molecules. In obesity and type II diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin resistance causes impairment of the endocrine function of the perivascular adipose tissue, an imbalance in the secretion of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator molecules, and an increased production of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have shown that targeting plasma levels of adipokines or the expression of their receptors can increase insulin sensitivity, improve vascular function, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several reviews have discussed the potential of adipokines as therapeutic targets for type II DM and obesity; however, this review is the first to focus on their therapeutic potential for vascular dysfunction in type II DM and obesity.</p>

<p>Adipose and endothelial dysfunction is associated with cardiovascular disease. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) directly surrounds vessels and influences vessel function via a paracrine effect, and adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) modulates the metabolic pathway, thus, the present study hypothesized that activation of AMPK in PVAT may regulate endothelial function in pathological settings. The present study investigated the effect of methotrexate (MTX) on adipocytokine expression in PVAT with an emphasis on the regulation of endothelial function. The effects of MTX and the mechanisms involved were investigated using a relaxation assay and western blot analysis. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels. ELISA assay was used to quantify the level of TNF-a and IL-6. Palmitic acid (PA) stimulation induced inflammation and dysregulation of adipocytokine expression in PVAT. MTX treatment inhibited nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B p65 phosphorylation and downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6, whereas adiponectin expression increased. MTX increased AMPK phosphorylation under basal and inflammatory conditions in PVAT, whereas knockdown of AMPK via small interfering RNA diminished its modulatory effect, indicating that MTX inhibits inflammation in an AMPK-dependent manner. The present study prepared conditioned medium from PA-stimulated PVAT to induce endothelial dysfunction and observed that pre-treatment of PVAT with MTX effectively restored the loss of acetylcholine-induced vasodilation and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in the rat aorta. The results of the present study demonstrated that MTX ameliorated inflammation-associated adipocytokine dysregulation and thus prevented endothelial dysfunction. These data provide further pharmacological evidence regarding the beneficial effects of MTX in cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is now recognized as an active player in vascular homeostasis. The expansion of PVAT in obesity and its possible role in vascular dysfunction have attracted much interest. In terms of the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure, PVAT has been shown to release vasoactive mediators, for instance, angiotensin peptides, reactive oxygen species, chemokines and cytokines. The secretory profile of PVAT is altered by obesity, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, leading to an imbalance between its pro-contractile and anti-contractile effects. PVAT adipocytes represent an important source of the mediators, but infiltrating immune cells may become more important under conditions of hypoxia and inflammation. This review describes recent advances in the effects of PVAT on the regulation of vascular tone, highlighting the evidence for a pro-contractile action in health and disease. The role of the endothelium, vascular smooth muscle, immune cells and probably perivascular nerves in PVAT function is also discussed.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds blood vessels and releases paracrine factors, such as cytokines, which regulate local inflammation. The inflammatory state of PVAT has an important role in vascular disease; a pro-inflammatory state has been related with atherosclerosis development, whereas an anti-inflammatory one is protective. Cold exposure beneficially affects immune responses and, could thus impact the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of one-week of cold exposure at 4°C of ferrets on aortic PVAT (aPVAT) versus subcutaneous adipose tissue. Ferrets were used because of the similarity of their adipose tissues to those of humans. A ferret-specific Agilent microarray was designed to cover the complete ferret genome and global gene expression analysis was performed. The data showed that cold exposure altered gene expression mainly in aPVAT. Most of the regulated genes were associated with cell cycle, immune response and gene expression regulation, and were mainly down-regulated. Regarding the effects on immune response, cold acclimation decreased the expression of genes involved in antigen recognition and presentation, cytokine signalling and immune system maturation and activation. This immunosuppressive gene expression pattern was depot-specific, as it was not observed in the inguinal subcutaneous depot. Interestingly, this depression in immune response related genes was also evident in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In conclusion, these results reveal that cold acclimation produces an inhibition of immune response-related pathways in aPVAT, reflected in PBMC, indicative of an anti-inflammatory response, which can potentially be exploited for the enhancement or maintenance of cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adiponectin, the most abundant peptide secreted by adipocytes, is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and vascular physiology. Here, we have investigated the effects of exogenous administration of adiponectin on metabolism, vascular reactivity and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) of mesenteric arteries in Wistar rats fed a high-fat diet.KEY RESULTS: Chronic adiponectin treatment reduced body weight, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, fasting glucose and area under the curve of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, compared with HFD rats. It also normalized NO-dependent vasorelaxation increasing endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation in mesenteric arteries of HFD rats. In PVAT from aged (W12m) and HFD rats there was increased expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory adipokines, the latter being important contributors to endothelial dysfunction. Infusion of adiponectin reduced these changes.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Adiponectin normalized endothelial cell function by a mechanism that involved increased eNOS phoshorylation and decreased PVAT inflammation. Detailed characterization of the adiponectin signalling pathway in the vasculature and perivascular fat is likely to provide novel approaches to the management of atherosclerosis and metabolic disease.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tears are a common cause of shoulder pain and often necessitate operative repair. Muscle atrophy, fibrosis, and fatty infiltration can develop after rotator cuff tears, which may compromise surgical outcomes. This study investigated the regenerative potential of 2 human adipose-derived progenitor cell lineages in a murine model of massive rotator cuff tears.METHODS: Ninety immunodeficient mice were used (15 groups of 6 mice). Mice were assigned to 1 of 3 surgical procedures: sham, supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendon transection (TT), or TT and denervation via suprascapular nerve transection (TT + DN). Perivascular stem cells (PSCs) were harvested from human lipoaspirate and sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting into pericytes (CD146 CD34 CD45 CD31) and adventitial cells (CD146 CD34 CD45 CD31). Mice received no injection, injection with saline solution, or injection with pericytes or adventitial cells either at the time of the index procedure (“prophylactic”) or at 2 weeks following the index surgery (“therapeutic”). Muscles were harvested 6 weeks following the index procedure. Wet muscle weight, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, fibrosis, and fatty infiltration were analyzed.RESULTS: PSC treatment after TT (prophylactic or therapeutic injections) and after TT + DN (therapeutic injections) resulted in less muscle weight loss and greater muscle fiber cross-sectional area than was demonstrated for controls (p &lt; 0.05). The TT + DN groups treated with pericytes at either time point or with adventitial cells at 2 weeks postoperatively had less fibrosis than the TT + DN controls. There was less fatty infiltration in the TT groups treated with pericytes at either time point or with adventitial cells at the time of surgery compared with controls.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated significantly less muscle atrophy in the groups treated with PSCs compared with controls. This suggests that the use of PSCs may have a role in the prevention of muscle atrophy without leading to increased fibrosis or fatty infiltration.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Improved muscle quality in the setting of rotator cuff tears may increase the success rates of surgical repair and lead to superior clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases numerous factors and adipokines with paracrine effects on both vascular structure and function. These effects are variable as they depend on regional differences in PVAT among blood vessels and vary with changes in adiposity. There is considerable evidence demonstrating an association between coronary PVAT and the development and progression of coronary artery disease, which is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling and blood clotting. However, PVAT also has a protective role in vascular grafts, especially the no-touch saphenous vein, in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass. This beneficial influence of PVAT involves factors such as adipocyte-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide (NO), leptin, adiponectin, prostanoids, hydrogen sulphide and neurotransmitters, as well as mechanical protection. This article aims to highlight and compare the dual role of PVAT in the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis, as well as in increased graft patency. Different deleterious and protective mechanisms of PVAT are also discussed and the inside-outside signalling paradigm of atherosclerosis development re-evaluated. The bidirectional communication between the arterial and venous wall and their surrounding PVAT, where signals originating from the vascular wall or lumen can affect PVAT phenotype, has been shown to be very complex. Moreover, signals from PVAT also influence the structure and function of the vascular wall in a paracrine manner.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>Obesity is a global epidemic, accompanied by increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue hypertrophy is associated with adipose tissue inflammation, which alters the secretion of adipose tissue-derived bioactive products, known as adipokines. Adipokines determine vessel wall properties such as smooth muscle tone and vessel wall inflammation. Exercise is a mainstay of prevention of chronic, non-communicable diseases, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in particular. Aside from reducing adipose tissue mass, exercise has been shown to reduce inflammatory activity in this tissue. Mechanistically, contracting muscles release bioactive molecules known as myokines, which alter the metabolic phenotype of adipose tissue. In adipose tissue, myokines induce browning, enhance fatty acid oxidation and improve insulin sensitivity. In the past years, the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) which surrounds the vasculature, has been shown to control vascular tone and inflammation through local release of adipokines. In obesity, an increase in mass and inflammation of PVAT culminate in dysregulation of adipokine secretion, which contributes to vascular dysfunction. This review describes our current understanding of the mechanisms by which active muscles interact with adipose tissue and improve vascular function. Aside from the exercise-dependent regulation of canonical adipose tissue function, we will focus on the interactions between skeletal muscle and PVAT and the role of novel myokines, such as IL-15, FGF21 and irisin, in these interactions.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>The heavy impact of obesity on the development and progression of cardiovascular disease has sparked sustained efforts to uncover the mechanisms linking excess adiposity to vascular dysfunction. In addition to its well-established role in maintaining vascular homeostasis, the endothelium has been increasingly recognized as a key player in modulating healthy adipose tissue expansion in response to excess calories by providing adipocyte precursors and driving angiogenesis. When this increased storage need is unmet, excessive deposition of fat occurs at ectopic locations, including perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). PVAT is in intimate contact with the vessel wall, hence affecting vascular function and structure. In lean individuals, PVAT exerts anticontractile and anti-inflammatory activities to protect the vasculature. In obesity, instead, these beneficial properties are lost and PVAT releases inflammatory mediators, promotes oxidative stress, and contributes to vascular dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms elicited by these outside-in signals include resistance to the vasodilator actions of insulin and activation of endothelin (ET)-1-mediated vasoconstriction. A number of adipokines and gut hormones, which are important modulators of food intake, energy balance, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation, have also positive vascular actions. This feature makes them promising tools for targeting both the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of obesity, a view supported by recent large-scale clinical trials indicating that novel drugs for type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular potential may translate into clinically significant benefits. There is, therefore, real hope that unleashing the power of fat- and gut-derived substances might provide effective dual-action therapies for obesity and its complications.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. In vascular pathologies, perivascular adipose tissue increases in volume and becomes dysfunctional, with altered cellular composition and molecular characteristics. PVAT dysfunction is characterized by its inflammatory character, oxidative stress, diminished production of vaso-protective adipocyte-derived relaxing factors and increased production of paracrine factors such as resistin, leptin, cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-a) and chemokines [RANTES (CCL5) and MCP-1 (CCL2)]. These adipocyte-derived factors initiate and orchestrate inflammatory cell infiltration including primarily T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells and NK cells. Protective factors such as adiponectin can reduce NADPH oxidase superoxide production and increase NO bioavailability in the vessel wall, while inflammation (e.g. IFN-<U+03B3> or IL-17) induces vascular oxidases and eNOS dysfunction in the endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells and adventitial fibroblasts. All of these events link the dysfunctional perivascular fat to vascular dysfunction. These mechanisms are important in the context of a number of cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Inflammatory changes in PVAT’s molecular and cellular responses are uniquely different from classical visceral or subcutaneous adipose tissue or from adventitia, emphasizing the unique structural and functional features of this adipose tissue compartment. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques for monitoring the characteristics of PVAT and assessing its inflammation. This will lead to a better understanding of the early stages of vascular pathologies and the development of new therapeutic strategies focusing on perivascular adipose tissue.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

Thus, we investigated the regulatory role and putative vasoprotective effects of BAT, focusing on hydrogen peroxide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (Nox4), and redox-sensitive signaling.We identify a novel vasoprotective action of BAT through an anticontractile effect that is mechanistically different to WAT. Specifically, BAT, via Nox4-derived hydrogen peroxide, induces cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase G type-1a activation, resulting in reduced vascular contractility. BAT may constitute an interesting therapeutic target to restore vascular function and prevent vascular complications in cardiovascular diseases.</AbstractText>: We identify a novel vasoprotective action of BAT through an anticontractile effect that is mechanistically different to WAT.

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have recently shown that a reduced function of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes crucially to obesity-induced vascular dysfunction in mice. The current study was conducted to test the hypothesis that vascular dysfunction in obesity can be reversed by in vivo improvement of PVAT eNOS activity.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 22 weeks to induce obesity. During the last 4 weeks of HFD feeding, the obese mice were treated p.o. with the standardized Crataegus extract WS® 1442, which has been shown previously to improve eNOS activity.KEY RESULTS: Diet-induced obesity in mice markedly reduced the vasodilator response of thoracic aorta to acetylcholine in wire myograph experiments. Strikingly, this vascular dysfunction was only evident in PVAT-containing aorta but not in PVAT-free aorta. In vivo treatment of obese mice with WS® 1442 had no effect on body weight or epididymal fat mass, but completely restored the vascular function of PVAT-containing aorta. Feeding a HFD led to a reduced phosphorylation and an enhanced acetylation of PVAT eNOS, both effects were reversed by WS® 1442 treatment.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: PVAT plays a key role in vascular dysfunction in diet-induced obese mice. Not obesity itself, but a PVAT dysfunction is responsible for obesity-induced vascular disorders. Improving PVAT function by pharmacological means (e.g. with WS® 1442) can ameliorate vascular function even without reducing body weight or fat mass.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized in the adipose tissue mainly by cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE). Several studies have demonstrated that H2S is involved in adipogenesis, that is the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes, most likely by inhibiting phosphodiesterases and increasing cyclic AMP concentration. The effect of H2S on adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake is controversial. Some studies suggest that H2S inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake and that excess of H2S contributes to adipose tissue insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that H2S stimulates glucose uptake and its deficiency contributes to insulin resistance. Similarly, the effect of H2S on adipose tissue lipolysis is controversial. H2S produced by perivascular adipose tissue decreases vascular tone by activating ATP-sensitive and/or voltage-gated potassium channels in smooth muscle cells. Experimental obesity induced by high calorie diet has a time dependent effect on H2S in perivascular adipose tissue; short and long-term obesity increase and decrease H2S production, respectively. Hyperglycemia has been consistently demonstrated to suppress CSE-H2S pathway in various adipose tissue depots. Finally, H2S deficiency may contribute to adipose tissue inflammation associated with obesity/metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived adiponectin (APN) is a secreted adipokine that protects against hypertension-related cardiovascular injury. However, the regulation of APN expression in hypertension remains to be explored. In this study, we demonstrated that down-regulation of APN was associated with complement activation in the PVAT of desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive mice. Complement 3-deficient hypertensive mice were protected from ANP decrease in the PVAT. APN deficiency blockaded the protective effects of complement inhibition against hypertensive vascular injury. Mechanistically, complement 5a (C5a)-induced TNF-a secretion from macrophages is required for inhibiting APN expression in adipocytes. Macrophage depletion reversed C5a agonist peptide-induced TNF-a up-regulation and APN down-regulation in the PVAT of DOCA mice. Moreover, we detected increased macrophage infiltration and C5a expression associated with decreased APN expression in adipose tissue from patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma. These results identify a novel interaction between macrophages and adipocytes in the PVAT, where complement-mediated inhibition of APN acts as a potential risk factor for hypertensive vascular inflammation.-Ruan, C.-C., Ma, Y., Ge, Q., Li, Y., Zhu, L.-M., Zhang, Y., Kong, L.-R., Wu, Q-H., Li, F., Cheng, L., Zhao, A.

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. The protective role of angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-(1-7)) in vascular pathologies suggested the therapeutic use of low MW, non-peptide Ang-(1-7) mimetics, such as AVE0991. The mechanisms underlying the vaso-protective effects of AVE0991, a Mas receptor agonist, remain to be explored.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the effects of AVE0991 on the spontaneous atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice, in the context of vascular inflammation and plaque stability.KEY RESULTS: AVE0991 has significant anti-atherosclerotic properties in ApoE-/- mice and increases plaque stability, by reducing plaque macrophage content, without effects on collagen. Using the descending aorta of chow-fed ApoE-/- mice, before significant atherosclerotic plaque develops, we gained insight to early events in atherosclerosis. Interestingly, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and adventitial infiltration with macrophages and T-cells precedes atherosclerotic plaque or the impairment of endothelium-dependent NO bioavailability (a measure of endothelial function). AVE0991 inhibited perivascular inflammation, by reducing chemokine expression in PVAT and through direct actions on monocytes/macrophages inhibiting their activation, characterized by production of IL-1ß, TNF-a, CCL2 and CXCL10, and differentiation to M1 phenotype. Pretreatment with AVE0991 inhibited migration of THP-1 monocytes towards supernatants of activated adipocytes (SW872). Mas receptors were expressed in PVAT and in THP-1 cells in vitro, and the anti-inflammatory effects of AVE0991 were partly Mas dependent.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The selective Mas receptor agonist AVE0991 exhibited anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory actions, affecting monocyte/macrophage differentiation and recruitment to the perivascular space during early stages of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Targeting Inflammation to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk.

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Obesity is associated with structural and functional changes in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), favouring release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory factors. The cytokine TNF-a induces vascular dysfunction and is produced by PVAT. We tested the hypothesis that obesity-associated PVAT dysfunction was mediated by augmented mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generation due to increased TNF-a production in this tissue.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: TNF-a-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress is a key and novel mechanism involved in obesity-associated PVAT dysfunction. These findings elucidate molecular mechanisms whereby oxidative stress in PVAT could affect vascular function.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>Rat perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) stores, takes up, and releases norepinephrine (NE; Ayala-Lopez et al. (2014) Pharmacol Res Perspect 2, e00041). We hypothesized that 3T3-L1 adipocytes would exhibit similar behaviors and, thus, could serve as a model for PVAT adipocytes. However, basal levels of NE were not detected in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. While incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with exogenous NE increased their cellular NE content, the mRNA expression of several NE transporters [e.g., norepinephrine transporter (NET)] were not detected in these cells. Similarly, we observed expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (VMAT1) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by qRT-PCR and immunostaining, but stimulation of the cells with tyramine (100 µm) did not cause a significant release of NE. These studies support that 3T3-L1 adipocytes are not an adequate model of perivascular adipocytes for studying NE handling.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: Meniscus contains heterogeneous populations of cells that have not been fully characterized. Cell phenotype is often lost during culture; however, culture expansion is typically required for tissue engineering. We examined and compared cell-surface molecule expression levels on human meniscus cells from the vascular and avascular regions and articular chondrocytes while documenting changes during culture-induced dedifferentiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expressions of 16 different surface molecules were examined by flow cytometry after monolayer culture for 24 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks. Menisci were also immunostained to document the spatial distributions of selected surface molecules.RESULTS: Meniscus cells and chondrocytes exhibited several similarities in surface molecule profiles with dynamic changes during culture. A greater percentage of meniscal cells were positive for CD14, CD26, CD49c, and CD49f compared to articular chondrocytes. Initially, more meniscal cells from the vascular region were positive for CD90 compared to cells from the avascular region or chondrocytes. Cells from the vascular region also expressed higher levels of CD166 and CD271 compared to cells from the avascular region. CD90, CD166, and CD271-positive cells were predominately perivascular in location. However, CD166-positive cells were also located in the superficial layer and in the adjacent synovial and adipose tissue.CONCLUSIONS: These surface marker profiles provide a target phenotype for differentiation of progenitors in tissue engineering. The spatial location of progenitor cells in meniscus is consistent with higher regenerative capacity of the vascular region, while the surface progenitor subpopulations have potential to be utilized in tears created in the avascular region.</p>

<p>Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is a rare, soft tissue tumor that can occur in various locations. The present report included three patients (one male and two females; age range, 25-51 years) with hepatic PEComas. The collected data included the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, treatment, and prognosis. Since it is difficult to diagnose hepatic PEComas by imaging, the patients were diagnosed by tumor tissue examination such as immunohistochemistry, which was positive for HMB-45, Melan-A, and SMA on all slides. The tumor was composed of diverse tissues including smooth muscle, adipose tissue, and thick-walled blood vessels. During the follow-up period, one of the tumors was malignant (double-positive for CD34 and Ki-67) and recurred 3 months after surgery. In addition, malignant hepatic PEComas were reviewed in the literature, indicating that the majority of hepatic PEComas are benign, but few hepatic PEComas exhibit malignant behaviors in older female patients (&gt;50 years of age) with abdominal discomfort and pain, larger tumor size (&gt;10 cm), or positive staining for CD34 and Ki-67. In conclusion, there is no effective method to diagnose PEComas. Currently, the diagnosis of PEComas depends on immunohistochemical staining. Tumor resection and close follow-up are the principal methods for the management of PEComas.</p>

<p>Heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Some cardiovascular conditions can be modulated by lifestyle factors such as increased exercise or a healthier diet, but many require surgical or pharmacological interventions for their management. More targeted and less invasive therapies would be beneficial. Recently, it has become apparent that epicardial adipose tissue plays an important role in normal and pathological cardiac function, and it is now the focus of considerable research. Epicardial adipose tissue can be studied by imaging of various kinds, and these approaches have yielded much useful information. However, at a molecular level, it is more difficult to study as it is relatively scarce in animal models and, for practical and ethical reasons, not always available in sufficient quantities from patients. What is needed is a robust model system in which the interactions between epicardial adipocytes and cardiac myocytes can be studied, and physiologically relevant manipulations performed. There are drawbacks to conventional culture methods, not least the difficulty of culturing both cardiac myocytes and adipocytes, each of which has special requirements. We discuss the benefits of a three-dimensional co-culture model in which in vivo interactions can be replicated.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>Excess visceral adiposity, in particular that located adjacent to the heart and coronary arteries is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In the pathophysiological state, dysfunctional adipose tissue secretes an array of factors modulating vascular function and driving atherogenesis. Conversely, brown and beige adipose tissues utilise glucose and lipids to generate heat and are associated with improved cardiometabolic health. The cardiac and thoracic perivascular adipose tissues are now understood to be composed of brown adipose tissue in the healthy state and undergo a brown-to-white transition i.e. during obesity which may be a driving factor of cardiovascular disease. In this review we discuss the risks of excess cardiac and vascular adiposity and potential mechanisms by which restoring the brown phenotype i.e. “re-browning” could potentially be achieved in clinically relevant populations.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) inflammation may have a role in coronary artery disease (CAD) pathophysiology. However, most evidence has come from samples obtained during surgical procedures that may imply in some limitations. Moreover, the role of B lymphocytes and inflammation in PAT that is adjacent to unstable atheroma plaques has not been investigated in humans using morphometric measurements.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the inflammation in PAT, subcutaneous, and perirenal adipose tissues (SAT and PrAT) among chronic CAD, acute CAD, and control groups in an autopsy study.METHODS: Heart, SAT, and PrAT samples are collected from autopsied subjects in a general autopsy service, with the written informed consent of the next-of-kin (NOK). Sociodemographic and clinical data are obtained from a semistructure interview with the NOK. Coronary arteries are dissected and PAT are removed. Sections with the greatest arterial obstruction or unstable plaques, and the local with absence of atherosclerosis in all coronary arteries are sampled. PAT are represented adjacent to these fragments. Adipose tissues are fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde solution and analyzed immunohistochemically for macrophages (CD68), macrophage polarization (CD11c for proinflammatory and CD206 for anti-inflammatory), B lymphocytes (CD20), and T lymphocytes (CD3). Slides will be scanned, and inflammatory cells will be quantified in 20 random fields. Participants will be categorized in CAD groups, after morphometric measurement of arterial obstruction and plaque composition analysis in accordance with American Heart Association classification. Three study groups will be investigated: acute CAD (at least one unstable plaque); chronic CAD (=50% arterial obstruction); and controls (&lt;50% arterial obstruction). Inflammatory cells in PAT, SAT, and PrAT will be counted and compared between groups using multivariate linear regression, adjusted for age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol use, and smoking.RESULTS: We present the methods of our study that was developed from 2 pilots. Currently, data collection and tissue processing are ongoing. Data collection, histology and immunochemistry procedures, and quantification of all inflammatory cells are expected to be concluded within 1 year.CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute for the understanding of the mechanisms of CAD pathophysiology because it will help to clarify the role of inflammation both in chronic and acute CAD.</p>

<p>Smoking is considered to be one of the primary causes of atherosclerosis and vascular injury. Previous studies have shown that nicotine in tobacco can lead to vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is known to secrete various types of adipokines to maintain vascular homeostasis. The present study investigated whether nicotine-induced PVAT malfunction can accelerate endothelial inflammation and eventually lead to endothelial dysfunction. The levels of inflammatory adipokines, including nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B, interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, the ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecules and secretion of adiponectin were assessed in mature adipocytes and endothelial cells cultured alone or in co-culture under nicotine stimulation. It was found that nicotine reduced the secretion of adiponectin and stimulated secretion of the NF-<U+03BA>B, IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-a inflammatory adipokines in mature adipocytes. Although nicotine stimulated endothelial cells to secrete IL-1ß and IL-6, no significant increase in the secretion of TNF-a was observed. The co-culture of mature adipocytes with endothelial cells markedly augmented the expression of the NF-<U+03BA>B, IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-a inflammatory adipokines and the ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 adhesion molecules, and significantly lowered the levels of adiponectin. These findings suggested that nicotine induced mature adipocyte dysfunction, which caused the abnormal secretion of adiponectin and inflammatory adipokines, and exacerbated endothelial inflammation. These findings also suggested a mechanism whereby nicotine induced the secretion of adiponectin and inflammatory cytokines by adipocytes. The results of the present study elucidated a novel pathway induced by cigarette smoke, which contributed to atherosclerosis and vascular injury.</p>

<p>The revolutionary discovery in 1991 by Soltis and Cassis that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has an anti-contractile effect changed how we think about the vasculature. Most experiments on vascular pharmacology begin by removing the fat surrounding vessels. Thus, PVAT was thought to have a minor role in vascular function and its presence was just for structural support. The need to rethink PVAT’s role was precipitated by observations that obesity carries a high cardiovascular risk and PVAT dysfunction is associated with obesity. PVAT is a vascular-adipose organ that has intimate connections with the nervous and immune system. A complex world of physiology resides in PVAT, including the presence of an ‘adrenergic system’ that is able to release, take up and metabolize noradrenaline. Adipocytes, stromal vascular cells and nerves within PVAT contain components that make up this adrenergic system. Some of the great strides in PVAT research came from studying adipose tissue as a whole. Adipose tissue has many roles and participates in regulating energy balance, energy stores, inflammation and thermoregulation. However, PVAT is dissimilar from non-PVAT adipose tissues. PVAT is intimately connected with the vasculature, which is what makes its role in body homeostasis unique. The adrenergic system within PVAT may be an integral link connecting the effects of obesity with the vascular dysfunction observed in obesity-associated hypertension, a condition in which the sympathetic nervous system has a significant role. This review will explore what is known about the adrenergic system in adipose tissue and PVAT, plus the translational importance of these findings.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>The relation between B2 cells and commensal microbes during atherosclerosis remains largely unexplored. Here we show that under hyperlipidemic conditions intestinal microbiota resulted in recruitment and ectopic activation of B2 cells in perivascular adipose tissue, followed by an increase in circulating IgG, promoting disease development. In contrast, disruption of the intestinal microbiota by a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (AVNM) led to the attenuation of atherosclerosis by suppressing B2 cells, despite the persistence of serum lipid abnormalities. Furthermore, pharmacological depletion of B2 cells with an anti-B2-cell surface CD23 antibody also attenuated commensal microbe-induced atherosclerosis. Moreover, expression analysis of TLR-signaling-related genes in the activated B2 cell subsets, assessed using the Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler PCR Array, confirmed activation of the B2-cell autoantibody-production axis, which was associated with an increased capacity of B2 cells to bind to intestinal microbiota. Together, our findings reveal the critical role of commensal microbe-specific activation of B2 cells in the development of atherogenesis through lipid metabolism-independent mechanisms.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were initially identified as progenitors of skeletal tissues within mammalian bone marrow and cells with similar properties were also obtained from other tissues such as adipose and dental pulp. Although MSCs have been extensively investigated, their native behavior and in vivo identity remain poorly defined. Uncovering the in vivo identity of MSCs has been challenging due to the lack of exclusive cell markers, cellular alterations caused by culture methods, and extensive focus on in vitro properties for characterization. Although MSC site of origin influences their functional properties, these mesenchymal progenitors can be found in the perivascular space in virtually all organs from where they were obtained. However, the precise identity of MSCs within the vascular wall is highly controversial. The recurrent concept that MSCs correspond to pericytes in vivo has been supported mainly by their perivascular localization and expression of some molecular markers. However, this view has been a subject of controversy, in part, due to the application of loose criteria to define pericytes and due to the lack of a marker able to unequivocally identify these cells. Furthermore, recent evidences indicate that subpopulations of MSCs can be found at extravascular sites such as the endosteum. In this opinion review, we bring together the advances and pitfalls on the search for the in vivo identity of MSCs and highlight the recent evidences that suggest that perivascular MSCs are adventitial cells, acting as precursors of pericytes and other stromal cells during tissue homeostasis.</p>

<p>Pericytes (PCs) are a subset of perivascular cells that can give rise to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) when culture-expanded, and are postulated to give rise to MSC-like cells during tissue repair in vivo. PCs have been suggested to behave as stem cells (SCs) in situ in animal models, although evidence for this role in humans is lacking. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of highly purified, non-cultured adipose tissue (AT)-derived PCs (ATPCs) to detect gene expression changes that occur as they acquire MSC characteristics in vitro, and evaluated the hypothesis that human ATPCs exhibit a gene expression profile compatible with an AT SC phenotype. The results showed ATPCs are non-proliferative and express genes characteristic not only of PCs, but also of AT stem/progenitor cells. Additional analyses defined a gene expression signature for ATPCs, and revealed putative novel ATPC markers. Almost all AT stem/progenitor cell genes differentially expressed by ATPCs were not expressed by ATMSCs or culture-expanded ATPCs. Genes expressed by ATMSCs but not by ATPCs were also identified. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that PCs are SCs in vascularized tissues, highlight gene expression changes they undergo as they assume an MSC phenotype, and provide new insights into PC biology.</p>

<p>Insulin resistance is a systemic disorder that affects many organs and insulin-regulated pathways. The disorder is characterized by a reduced action of insulin despite increased insulin concentrations (hyperinsulinaemia). The effects of insulin on the kidney and vasculature differ in part from the effects on classical insulin target organs. Insulin causes vasodilation by enhancing endothelial nitric oxide production through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. In insulin-resistant states, this pathway is impaired and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway stimulates vasoconstriction. The action of insulin on perivascular fat tissue and the subsequent effects on the vascular wall are not fully understood, but the hepatokine fetuin-A, which is released by fatty liver, might promote the proinflammatory effects of perivascular fat. The strong association of salt-sensitive arterial hypertension with insulin resistance indicates an involvement of the kidney in the insulin resistance syndrome. The insulin receptor is expressed on renal tubular cells and podocytes and insulin signalling has important roles in podocyte viability and tubular function. Renal sodium transport is preserved in insulin resistance and contributes to the salt-sensitivity of blood pressure in hyperinsulinaemia. Therapeutically, renal and vascular insulin resistance can be improved by an integrated holistic approach aimed at restoring overall insulin sensitivity and improving insulin signalling.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue can modulate disease processes in a depot-specific manner. However, the functional properties of perivascular adipocytes, and their influence on the pathophysiology of blood vessel walls, remain to be determined. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether perivascular adipose tissue could have an ameliorative effect on blood vessels damaged in diabetes. Using in vitro coculture, and in vivo transplantation model simulating diabetic angioplasty-induced injury, we showed that perivascular adipose tissue has an important function in protecting blood vessels from high glucose impairment. Levels of inflammatory cytokines, including intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and osteopontin, were markedly reduced, whereas that of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase was markedly elevated in vascular walls. These depot-specific differences in blood vessels exposed to high levels of glucose were demonstrable both in vivo, with transplanted adipose tissues, and in vitro, when vascular endothelial cells were cocultured with adipocytes. In addition, intimal hyperplasia was also decreased by transplanted perivascular adipose tissue after balloon injury combined with hyperglycemia. We conclude that perivascular adipocytes can reduce inflammation in blood vessels and promote the normal function of endothelium, which could afford a new therapeutic strategy in vascular walls damaged by diabetes.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is now recognized as an important paracrine organ influencing the homeostasis of the vessel wall, regional blood flow and peripheral arterial resistance. There is remarkable phenotypic variability and plasticity of PVAT among various vascular beds, exhibiting phenotypes from white to brown and beige adipocytes. PVAT dysfunction is characterized by disturbed secretion of various adipokines, which, together with endothelial dysfunction, contribute to hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This brief review describes our current knowledge on PVAT in health and cardiovascular disease, with a special focus on different phenotypes and signaling pathways in adipocytes of PVAT associated with hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disorders.</p>

<p>Essential hypertension is a complex multifactorial disease process that involves the interaction of multiple genes at various loci throughout the genome, and the influence of environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle, to ultimately determine long-term arterial pressure. These factors converge with physiological signaling pathways to regulate the set-point of long-term blood pressure. In hypertension, structural changes in arteries occur and show differences within and between vascular beds, between species, models and sexes. Such changes can also reflect the development of hypertension, and the levels of circulating humoral and vasoactive compounds. The role of perivascular adipose tissue in the modulation of vascular structure under various disease states such as hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome is an emerging area of research, and is likely to contribute to the heterogeneity described in this review. Diversity in structure and related function is the norm, with morphological changes being causative in some beds and states, and in others, a consequence of hypertension. Specific animal models of hypertension have advantages and limitations, each with factors influencing the relevance of the model to the human hypertensive state/s. However, understanding the fundamental properties of artery function and how these relate to signalling mechanisms in real (intact) tissues is key for translating isolated cell and model data to have an impact and relevance in human disease etiology. Indeed, the ultimate aim of developing new treatments to correct vascular dysfunction requires understanding and recognition of the limitations of the methodologies used.</p>

<p>The inhibitory action of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in modulation of arterial contraction has been recently recognized and contrasted with the prohypertensive effect of obesity in humans. In this study we demonstrated that PVAT might have opposing effect on sympatho-adrenergic contractions in different rat conduit arteries. In superior mesenteric artery isolated from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), PVAT exhibited inhibitory influence on the contractions to exogenous noradrenaline as well as to endogenous noradrenaline released from arterial sympathetic nerves during transmural electrical stimulation or after application of tyramine. In contrast, the abdominal aorta with intact PVAT responded with larger contractions to transmural electrical stimulation and tyramine when compared to the aorta after removing PVAT; the responses to noradrenaline were similar in both. This indicates that PVAT may contain additional sources of endogenous noradrenaline which could be responsible for the main difference in the modulatory effect of PVAT on adrenergic contractions between abdominal aortas and superior mesenteric arteries. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the anticontractile effect of PVAT in mesenteric arteries was reduced, and the removal of PVAT completely eliminated the difference in the dose-response curves to exogenous noradrenaline between SHR and WKY. These results suggest that in mesenteric artery isolated from SHR, the impaired anticontractile influence of PVAT might significantly contribute to its increased sensitivity to adrenergic stimuli.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds most blood vessels and secretes numerous active substances, including adiponectin, which produce a net anticontractile effect in healthy individuals. AMPK is a key mediator of cellular energy balance and may mediate the vascular effects of adiponectin. In this study, we investigated the role of AMPK within PVAT in mediating the anticontractile effect of PVAT.KEY RESULTS: Thoracic aortic PVAT from KO mice was morphologically indistinct from that of WT and primarily composed of brown adipose tissue. PVAT augmented relaxation to cromakalim in WT but not KO aortic rings. Addition of WT PVAT augmented relaxation in KO aortic rings but KO PVAT had no effect in WT rings. PVAT from KO mice secreted significantly less adiponectin and addition of adiponectin to either KO or WT aortic rings without PVAT augmented relaxation to cromakalim. An adiponectin blocking peptide significantly attenuated relaxation in WT rings with PVAT but not in KO rings.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: AMPKa1 has a critical role in maintaining the anticontractile actions of PVAT; an effect independent of the endothelium but likely mediated through altered adiponectin secretion or sensitivity.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>AIM: The factors mediating the paracrine effects of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in atherosclerosis are largely unknown. The adipokine leptin has been implicated in the increased cardiovascular risk in obesity and may locally promote neointima formation independently of circulating leptin levels. In patients with established coronary artery disease, we examined the expression of leptin as well as of its possible inducers in ‘cardiac’ PVAT surrounding the aortic root and coronary arteries (C-PVAT), and compared it to the PVAT surrounding the internal mammary artery (IMA-PVAT), a vessel resistant to atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue specimens collected from male patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were processed for real-time PCR, ELISA, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Leptin protein expression was elevated in C-PVAT compared to IMA-PVAT, independent of serum leptin levels. Compared to IMA-PVAT, C-PVAT exhibited more pronounced angiogenesis and inflammation, as indicated by significantly higher numbers of PECAM1-positive vessels and CD68-positive macrophages, and was characterized by a greater extent of fibrosis and hypoxia. Increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and Fos-like antigen (FOSL)2, factors known to enhance leptin gene transcription, was observed in C-PVAT. As a proof of concept, exposure of human adipocytes to chemical hypoxia resulted in significantly increased FOSL2 and leptin mRNA levels.CONCLUSIONS: A higher degree of local tissue hypoxia and up-regulation of leptin expression in the perivascular adipose tissue, along with increased vascularization, inflammation, and fibrosis, may contribute to the increased atherosclerotic plaque burden in the coronary arteries compared to the IMA.</p>

<p>Many types of cancer develop in close association with highly vascularized adipose tissues. However, the role of adipose pre-existing vascular beds on tumor growth and angiogenesis is unknown. Here we report that pre-existing microvascular density in tissues where tumors originate is a crucial determinant for tumor growth and neovascularization. In three independent tumor types including breast cancer, melanoma, and fibrosarcoma, inoculation of tumor cells in the subcutaneous tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) resulted in markedly differential tumor growth rates and angiogenesis, which were in concordance with the degree of pre-existing vascularization in these tissues. Relative to subcutaneous tumors, WAT and BAT tumors grew at accelerated rates along with improved neovascularization, blood perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. Tumor cells implanted in adipose tissues contained leaky microvessel with poor perivascular cell coverage. Thus, adipose vasculature predetermines the tumor microenvironment that eventually supports tumor growth.</p>

<p>This review focuses on the contribution of white, brown, and perivascular adipose tissues to the pathophysiology of obesity and its associated metabolic and vascular complications. Weight gain in obesity generates excess of fat, usually visceral fat, and activates the inflammatory response in the adipocytes and then in other tissues such as liver. Therefore, low systemic inflammation responsible for insulin resistance contributes to atherosclerotic process. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between body mass index and brown adipose tissue activity has been described. For these reasons, in recent years, in order to combat obesity and its related complications, as a complement to conventional treatments, a new insight is focusing on the role of the thermogenic function of brown and perivascular adipose tissues as a promising therapy in humans. These lines of knowledge are focused on the design of new drugs, or other approaches, in order to increase the mass and/or activity of brown adipose tissue or the browning process of beige cells from white adipose tissue. These new treatments may contribute not only to reduce obesity but also to prevent highly prevalent complications such as type 2 diabetes and other vascular alterations, such as hypertension or atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>During the last quarter of the past century, the leading role the endocrine and nervous systems had on the regulation of vasomotion, shifted towards a more paracrine-based regulation. This begun with the recognition of endothelial cells as active players of vascular control, when the vessel’s intimal layer was identified as the main source of prostacyclin and was followed by the discovery of an endothelium-derived smooth muscle cell relaxing factor (EDRF). The new position acquired by endothelial cells prompted the discovery of other endothelium-derived regulatory products: vasoconstrictors, generally known as EDCFs, endothelin, and other vasodilators with hyperpolarizing properties (EDHFs). While this research was taking place, a quest for the discovery of the nature of EDRF carried back to a research line commenced a decade earlier: the recently found intracellular messenger cGMP and nitrovasodilators. Both were smooth muscle relaxants and appeared to interact in a hormonal fashion. Prejudice against an unconventional gaseous molecule delayed the acceptance that EDRF was nitric oxide (NO). When this happened, a new era of research that exceeded the vascular field commenced. The discovery of the pathway for NO synthesis from L-arginine involved the clever assembling of numerous unrelated observations of different areas of knowledge. The last ten years of research on the paracrine regulation of the vascular wall has shifted to perivascular fat (PVAT), which is beginning to be regarded as the fourth layer of the vascular wall. Starting with the discovery of an adipose-derived relaxing substance (ADRF), the role that different adipokines have on the paracrine control of vasomotion is now filling the research activity of many vascular pharmacology labs, and surprising interactions between the endothelium, PVAT and smooth muscle are being unveiled.</p>

<p>The endothelium is an established modulator of vascular tone; however, the recent discovery of the anti-contractile nature of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) suggests that the fat, which surrounds many blood vessels, can also modulate vascular tone. Both the endothelium and PVAT secrete vasoactive substances, which regulate vascular function. Many of these factors are common to both the endothelium and PVAT; therefore, this review will highlight the potential shared mechanisms in the modulation of vascular tone. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of many vascular diseases, including hypertension and obesity. Moreover, PVAT dysfunction is now being reported in several cardio-metabolic disorders. Thus, this review will also discuss the mechanistic insights into endothelial and PVAT dysfunction in order to evaluate whether PVAT modulation of vascular contractility is similar to that of the endothelium in health and disease.LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

<p>There are sex associated differences in the risk for cardiovascular comorbidities in obesity and metabolic syndrome. A common clinical finding in these diseases is the expansion of perivascular adipose tissues (PVAT) which is associated with alterations in their role as regulators of vessel function. PVAT hyperplasia and hypertrophy are dependent on the biology of populations of adipocyte progenitor cells (APC). It is currently unclear if PVAT enlargement diverges between males and females and the mechanisms linking APC biology with sexual dimorphism remain poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that vessel location and sexual dimorphism affect the distribution and adipogenic capacity of APC in cardiovascular disease risk relevant PVAT sites. PVAT from thoracic aorta (aPVAT) and mesenteric resistance arteries (mPVAT) was collected from 10-week-old female and male Sprague-Dawley rats. Differences in APC distribution in stromal vascular fraction cells from PVAT were determined. APC were defined as cells expressing CD34, CD44, and platelet derived growth factor a In both sexes aPVAT had fewer APC compared to mPVAT and perigonadal adipose tissue (GON). Sex-related differences were observed in the expression of CD34, where females had fewer CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in PVATs. APC proliferation and adipogenic capacity in vitro were not affected by sex. However, APC from aPVAT had a lower proliferation capacity compared to mPVAT These data demonstrate that the distribution of APC within PVAT exhibits sexual dimorphism and is affected by anatomical location.</p>

<p>Excess visceral adipose tissue is associated with increased risk of high blood pressure, lipid disorders, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ with multiple humoral and metabolic roles in regulating whole-body physiology. However, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) also plays a functional role in regulating the contractile state of the underlying smooth muscle cell layer. Work during the past decade has shown that this adipose-vascular coupling is achieved by production of numerous substances released from PVAT. Animal disease models have been instrumental in identifying biological and pathophysiological functions of this regulation. These studies have produced strong evidence that alterations in the paracrine control of PVAT in the regulation of arterial tone contribute to vascular dysfunction in obesity, hypertension, and cardiometabolic disease. Perivascular relaxing factors, or perhaps their putative targets, might represent exciting new targets for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.</p>

<p>Carcinomas arising from thyroglossal duct remnant cysts (TGDCs) are rare, without well-defined management and staging criteria. All TGDCs (n = 685) diagnosed between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed, with 22 carcinomas identified (3.2 % incidence). Twenty-two patients (17 females, 5 males), aged 12-64 years (mean 39.9 years; median 39 years) were identified. An anterior, superior midline neck mass was the presenting symptom in all patients. A cancer diagnosis [all papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)] was made after the Sistrunk procedure (SP), with a Bethesda Category V or VI classification preoperatively by fine needle aspiration in 5 of 12 cases tested. A SP was performed in all patients, with total thyroidectomy concurrently (n = 4) or subsequently (n = 12). A selected neck dissection was performed in 5 patients, with metastases found in 3. Of the patients who had a thyroidectomy, synchronous PTC was identified in 6 (thus, 6 of 22 patients had synchronous thyroid gland primaries). This supports an origin from extra-thyroidal remnants (cyst origin) rather than metastatic tumor from a thyroid gland primary. Follow-up radioactive iodine therapy was performed in 13 patients. Metastatic disease to local lymph nodes 57 months after presentation was seen in 1 patient, with all others alive and disease free (mean 3.8 years; range 0.4-10.8 years). The TGDCs ranged from 0.8 to 5 cm (mean 2.3 cm), while the PTCs ranged from 0.1 to 3.8 cm (mean 1.4 cm). All of the tumors were classical PTC, showing a sclerotic and infiltrative pattern, with a capsule present in 11. Lymphovascular invasion was detected in 11; margins were positive in 6. Using currently defined criteria, the patients were separated into AJCC stage group I (n = 21) or II (n = 1). However, if extension into the adipose tissue (n = 11), skeletal muscle (n = 10), or perineural/perivascular tissues (n = 10) were used to stage the patients, interpreted to represent the equivalent of “extrathyroidal extension” (n = 13) as defined for thyroid gland primaries, there would be 15 group I and 7 group III cases. All seven group III patients were =45 years. Three of four patients with lymph node metastasis also showed soft tissue extension. In conclusion, TGDC carcinomas (TGDCCa) are uncommon, with all classical PTC. For “microcarcinomas” (=1 cm), conservative management can be used for patients &lt;45 years (i.e., Sistrunk procedure only); for &gt;1 cm tumors, and due to the high incidence of concurrent papillary carcinoma and higher stage at presentation in older patients, completion thyroidectomy is recommended for patients =45 years. Thus, even though a good prognosis can be expected for PTC developing in TGDCs, staging is advocated to more appropriately match therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been shown to play important roles in regulating vascular tone and linking local and systemic vascular inflammation. We examined the impact of PVAT on phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction in the aorta of obese Zucker rats (OZR) and their lean littermates (LZR) by comparing aortic rings with or without PVAT. Subsequently we placed OZR and LZR on a control (C) or an 8% wild blueberry (WB) diet and evaluated the effect of WB consumption on such response. PVAT-released adipokine concentrations were also measured as a function of WB diet. Maximal constrictor force (Fmax) in aortic rings without PVAT was significantly lower in OZR-C compared with LZR-C (0.41 ± 0.05 and 0.71 ± 0.06 g, respectively). Following WB diet, Fmax significantly increased in OZR (0.54 ± 0.06 g). In aortas with intact PVAT, Fmax was significantly lower in all groups (0.31 ± 0.06 OZR-C, 0.30 ± 0.05 OZR-WB, 0.29 ± 0.03 LZR-C, and 0.30 ± 0.04 g LZR-WB), but no difference was observed between treatments. PVAT concentrations of monocyte chemoactractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and adiponectin were significantly higher in OZR compared with LZR (+102%, +108%, and +45%, respectively). Following WB diet, PVAT concentrations of interleukin-8 were significantly lower in both OZR (-37%) and LZR (-30%), while adiponectin concentrations significantly increased in both OZR (+11%) and LZR (+16%). MCP-1 concentrations significantly decreased (-31%) in the PVAT of OZR with the WB diet. WB consumption appears to attenuate local inflammation in PVAT, which may impact systemic vascular inflammation and endothelial function.</p>

<p>AIMS: To determine whether irisin could improve perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) dysfunction via regulation of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)/adiponectin axis in obesity.MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were given chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without treatment with irisin. The concentration-dependent responses of the thoracic aorta with or without PVAT (PVAT+ or PVAT-) to phenylephrine were studied in an organ bath. Protein levels of HO-1 and adiponectin were determined by western blot. UCP-1, Cidea, and TNF-a gene expression in PVAT were analyzed by real-time PCR.RESULTS: Treatment of obese mice with irisin improved glucose and lipid metabolism, reduced plasma levels of TNF-a and malondialdehyde, and increased plasma adiponectin levels (P&lt;0.01). The anti-contractile effects of PVAT were attenuated in HFD mice and this attenuation was restored in HFD mice treated with irisin (P&lt;0.05). Incubation of aortas (PVAT+) with the HO-1 inhibitor and adiponectin receptor blocking peptide in irisin-treated HFD mice abolished the beneficial effects of irisin on PVAT function. The same results were also observed in HFD mice treated with irisin ex vivo. Treatment of HFD mice with irisin significantly enhanced protein levels of HO-1 and adiponectin, and reduced superoxide production and TNF-a expression in PVAT. Irisin treatment enhanced brown adipocyte markers UCP-1 and Cidea expression in PVAT from HFD mice.CONCLUSION: Irisin improved the anti-contractile properties of PVAT from the thoracic aorta in diet-induced obese mice. The mechanism for protective effects of irisin appeared to be related to upregulation of the HO-1/adiponectin axis in PVAT and browning of PVAT.</p>

<p>In the last decade, results in both animal models and humans have demonstrated that white adipocytes are generated over the entire life-span. This adds to the plasticity of adipose tissue and alterations in adipocyte turnover are linked to metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes are derived from precursors present primarily in the perivascular areas of adipose tissue but their precise origin remains unclear. The multipotent differentiation capacity of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) has prompted the suggestion that BMDC may contribute to different cell tissue pools, including adipocytes. However, data in murine transplantation models have been conflicting and it has been a matter of debate whether BMDC actually differentiate into adipocytes or just fuse with resident fat cells. To resolve this controversy in humans, we recently performed a study in 65 subjects that had undergone bone marrow transplantation. Using a set of newly developed assays including single cell genome-wide analyses of mature adipocytes, we demonstrated that bone marrow contributes with approximately 10 % to the adipocyte pool. This proportion was more than doubled in obesity, suggesting that BMDC may constitute a reserve pool for adipogenesis, particularly upon weight gain. This commentary discusses the possible relevance of these and other recent findings for human pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Increased TNFa-mediated JNK signaling in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) may contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular complications in T1DM by reducing adiponectin (Ad) synthesis and therefore impairing Ad-mediated activity in the contiguous blood vessel system. We evaluated whether in vivo treatment with the TNFa blocking antibody infliximab normalized expression of Ad and Ad receptors in various fat depots, and whether this effect correlated with improved endothelial activity and vasodilator function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. STZ mice were studied at 1 and 2weeks after diabetes onset, and compared to age-matched infliximab-treated diabetic (I-STZ) and control animals (CTRL) (n=10 each group). In STZ mice, activation of pro-inflammatory JNK signaling was faster in PVAT (P&lt;0.01) than in visceral (VAT), epididymal (EAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose depots, and associated with decreased Ad synthesis and dysregulated AdipoR1/R2 levels. In parallel, activation of JNK in aortic endothelial cells and mesenteric arteries was associated with decreased expression/phosphorylation of eNOS and impaired ACh-mediated vasodilation (P&lt;0.05 vs. CTRL). Treatment with infliximab abrogated JNK activation, ameliorated Ad protein expression, and normalized expression of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in PVAT, concomitantly improving eNOS expression and vessel relaxation in mesenteric arteries from I-STZ mice (P&lt;0.01 vs. STZ). These observations underline the early susceptibility of PVAT to activation of pro-inflammatory JNK signaling, and highlight its potential importance in early vascular changes of T1DM. Further elucidation of the role of PVAT in cardiovascular complications may allow for the design of novel therapeutic strategies directly addressing PVAT pathophysiology.</p>

<p>The anti-contractile effect of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is an important mechanism in the modulation of vascular tone in peripheral arteries. Recent evidence has implicated the XE991-sensitive voltage-gated KV (KCNQ) channels in the regulation of arterial tone by PVAT. However, until now the in vivo pharmacology of the involved vascular KV channels with regard to XE991 remains undetermined, since XE991 effects may involve Ca(2+) activated BKCa channels and/or voltage-dependent KV1.5 channels sensitive to diphenyl phosphine oxide-1 (DPO-1). In this study, we tested whether KV1.5 channels are involved in the control of mesenteric arterial tone and its regulation by PVAT. Our study was also aimed at extending our current knowledge on the in situ vascular pharmacology of DPO-1 and XE991 regarding KV1.5 and BKCa channels, in helping to identify the nature of K(+) channels that could contribute to PVAT-mediated relaxation. XE991 at 30 µM reduced the anti-contractile response of PVAT, but had no effects on vasocontraction induced by phenylephrine (PE) in the absence of PVAT. Similar effects were observed for XE991 at 0.3 µM, which is known to almost completely inhibit mesenteric artery VSMC KV currents. 30 µM XE991 did not affect BKCa currents in VSMCs. Kcna5 (-/-) arteries and wild-type arteries incubated with 1 µM DPO-1 showed normal vasocontractions in response to PE in the presence and absence of PVAT. KV current density and inhibition by 30 µM XE991 were normal in mesenteric artery VSMCs isolated from Kcna5 (-/-) mice. We conclude that KV channels are involved in the control of arterial vascular tone by PVAT. These channels are present in VSMCs and very potently inhibited by the KCNQ channel blocker XE991. BKCa channels and/or DPO-1 sensitive KV1.5 channels in VSMCs are not the downstream mediators of the XE991 effects on PVAT-dependent arterial vasorelaxation. Further studies will need to be undertaken to examine the role of other KV channels in the phenomenon.</p>

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic melatonin treatment on the functional responses of the small mesenteric arteries and on the expression of markers of inflammation/oxidative stress in the aortas of senescence-accelerated prone mice (SAMP8), a model of age-related vascular dysfunction. We investigated seven SAMP8 and seven control senescence-accelerated resistant mice (SAMR1) treated for 10 months with melatonin, as well as equal numbers of age-matched untreated SAMP8 and SAMR1. The mesenteric small resistance arteries were dissected and mounted on a wire myograph, and the concentration-response to norepinephrine was evaluated in vessels with intact PVAT and after the removal of the PVAT. The expression of markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and aging in the aortas was evaluated by immunostaining. In addition, the adiponectin content and the expression of adiponectin receptor 1 were evaluated in the visceral adipose tissue. In untreated SAMP8 mice, we observed an overexpression of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the vasculature compared with the controls. No anticontractile effect of the PVAT was observed in untreated SAMP8 mice. Long-term treatment of SAMP8 mice with melatonin increased the expression of some markers of vasoprotection, decreased oxidative stress and inflammation and restored the anticontractile effect of the PVAT. Decreased expression of adiponectin and adiponectin receptor 1 was also observed in visceral fat of untreated SAMP8, whereas a significant increase was observed after melatonin treatment.</p>

<p>CONTEXT: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is suggested to impact on vascular cells via humoral factors, possibly contributing to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.OBJECTIVE: To address whether the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 affects the PVAT secretome.METHODS: Human perivascular (pre)adipocytes were subjected to targeted proteomics and whole-genome gene expression analysis.RESULTS: Preadipocytes, as compared to adipocytes, secreted higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Adipocytes released higher amounts of adipokines [e.g. adipisin, visfatin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), leptin; p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05, all]. In preadipocytes, omentin 1 release was 1.28-fold increased by FGF-21 (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05). In adipocytes, FGF-21 reduced chemerin release by 5% and enhanced DPP4 release by 1.15-fold (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.05, both). FGF-21 altered the expression of four secretory genes in preadipocytes and of 18 in adipocytes (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01, all).CONCLUSION: The hepatokine FGF-21 exerts secretome-modulating effects in human perivascular (pre)adipocytes establishing a new liver-PVAT-blood vessel axis that possibly contributes to vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>AIMS: Perivascular adipose tissue can be involved in the process of cardiovascular pathology through the release of adipokines, namely adiponectins. Monomeric adiponectin has been shown to increase coronary blood flow in anesthetized pigs through increased nitric oxide (NO) release and the involvement of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1). The present study was therefore planned to examine the effects of monomeric adiponectin on NO release and Ca(2+) transients in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEs) in normal/high glucose conditions and the related mechanisms.MAIN METHODS: PAEs were treated with monomeric adiponectin alone or in the presence of intracellular kinases blocker, AdipoR1 and Ca(2+)-ATPase pump inhibitors. The role of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger was examined in experiments performed in zero Na(+) medium. NO release and intracellular Ca(2+) were measured through specific probes.KEY FINDINGS: In PAE cultured in normal glucose conditions, monomeric adiponectin elevated NO production and [Ca(2+)]c. Similar effects were observed in high glucose conditions, although the response was lower and not transient. The Ca(2+) mobilized by monomeric adiponectin originated from an intracellular pool thapsigargin- and ATP-sensitive and from the extracellular space. Moreover, the effects of monomeric adiponectin were prevented by kinase blockers and AdipoR1 inhibitor. Finally, in normal glucose condition, a role for Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and Ca(2+)-ATPase pump in restoring Ca(2+) was found.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results add new information about the control of endothelial function elicited by monomeric adiponectin, which would be achieved by modulation of NO release and Ca(2+) transients. A signalling related to Akt, ERK1/2 and p38MAPK downstream AdipoR1 would be involved.</p>

<p>Divergent phenotypes between the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding the abdominal and the thoracic aorta might be implicated in regional aortic differences, such as susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Although PVAT of the thoracic aorta exhibits anti-contractile function, the role of PVAT in the regulation of the vascular tone of the abdominal aorta is not well defined. In the present study, we compared the anti-contractile function, nitric oxide (NO) availability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in PVAT and vessel walls of abdominal and thoracic aorta. Abdominal and thoracic aortic tissue from male Wistar rats were used to perform functional and molecular experiments. PVAT reduced the contraction evoked by phenylephrine in the absence and presence of endothelium in the thoracic aorta, whereas this anti-contractile effect was not observed in the abdominal aorta. Abdominal PVAT exhibited a reduction in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression compared with thoracic PVAT, without differences in eNOS expression in the vessel walls. In agreement with this result, NO production evaluated in situ using 4,5-diaminofluorescein was less pronounced in abdominal compared with thoracic aortic PVAT, whereas no significant difference was observed for endothelial NO production. Moreover, NOS inhibition with L-NAME enhanced the phenylephrine-induced contraction in endothelial-denuded rings with PVAT from thoracic but not abdominal aorta. ROS formation and lipid peroxidation products evaluated through the quantification of hydroethidine fluorescence and 4-hydroxynonenal adducts, respectively, were similar between PVAT and vessel walls from the abdominal and thoracic aorta. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression was similar between the vessel walls and PVAT of the abdominal and thoracic aorta. However, Mn-SOD levels were reduced, while CuZn-SOD levels were increased in abdominal PVAT compared with thoracic aortic PVAT. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the anti-contractile function of PVAT is lost in the abdominal portion of the aorta through a reduction in eNOS-derived NO production compared with the thoracic aorta. Although relative SOD isoforms are different along the aorta, ROS formation, and lipid peroxidation seem to be similar. These findings highlight the specific regional roles of PVAT depots in the control of vascular function that can drive differences in susceptibility to vascular injury.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue, a major endocrine organ, consists of brown and white adipocytes. Brown fat may play a beneficial role in cardiometabolic disorders. Brown adipose tissue can also improve glucose and lipid metabolism. In contrast, the expansion of white adipose tissue has been related to obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both the quantity and the quality of the white adipose tissue as well as its distribution may affect CVD risk. In this context, the link between adiposity and CVD risk is greater for visceral than subcutaneous fat. Apart from these fat depots, there are other adipose tissues that are either systemically (i.e. in the liver, muscle or neck) or mainly locally acting (i.e. pericardial/epicardial, perivascular and perirenal). These fat depots can affect the nearby anatomic organs via lipid accumulation and cytokine secretion. In the present narrative review, the associations of excessive peri-organ adipose tissue, namely intrahepatic, epicardial/ pericardial, perivascular, intramuscular, peripancreatic and perirenal fat, with cardiometabolic and CVD risk factors are discussed. The effects of drugs that target vascular risk and/or different fat depots are also considered.</p>

<p>Obesity, a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, is strongly associated with the development of hypertension and diabetes. Superoxide, a free radical elevated in obese individuals, promotes hypertension through scavenging the endogenous vasodilator nitric oxide. The hypothesis was a genistein-enriched diet would promote weight loss and reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the vasculature of intact female ob/ob mice. Aortas and mesenteric arteries were isolated from female ob/ob mice fed genistein-free (0mg genistein/kg diet; n=6), standard chow (200-300mg genistein/kg diet; n=11) or genistein-enriched (600mg genistein/kg diet; n=9) diets for 4weeks. Sections of isolated vessels were labeled with the superoxide indicator dihydroethidium and fluorescence was measured by confocal microscopy. Protein expression of the inflammatory marker inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was measured in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding each vessel and plasma concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were quantified. Genistein-enriched diet promoted less weight gain compared to animals fed standard chow (P=.008). Standard chow promoted increased superoxide in the aorta (P=.030) and mesenteric arteries (P=.024) compared to a diet devoid of genistein. At all tested concentrations, genistein significantly increased iNOS expression in mesenteric artery PVAT (vs. standard chow, P&lt;.001; vs. genistein-enriched, P=.002) and tended to increase iNOS within the aortic PVAT (standard chow, P=.075) compared to the genistein-free group. Plasma SOD activity was significantly downregulated in genistein-enriched animals as compared to those fed a genistein-free diet (P=.028). In summary, although genistein prevents weight gain, it promotes vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in obese ovarian-intact female mice.</p>

<p>Sustained stimulation of ß-adrenoceptors (ß-ARs) and activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are common features of cardiovascular diseases with rising sympathetic activation, including essential hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. In this study, we investigated the role of AT1 receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the vascular alterations caused by ß-AR overstimulation. ß-AR overstimulation with associated cardiac hypertrophy and increased vasoconstrictor response to phenylephrine in aorta were modeled in rats by 7-day isoproterenol treatment. The increased vasoconstrictor response to phenylephrine in this model was blunted by the MR antagonist spironolactone, but not by the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, despite the blunting of cardiac hypertrophy with both drugs. Spironolactone, but not losartan, restored NO bioavailability in association with lower endothelial nitric oxide synthase-derived superoxide production, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase dimerization, and aortic HSP90 upregulation. MR genomic and nongenomic functions were activated in aortas from isoproterenol-treated rats. Isoproterenol did not modify plasma levels of MR ligands aldosterone and corticosterone but rather increased perivascular adipose tissue-derived corticosterone in association with increased expression of 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. The anticontractile effect of aortic perivascular adipose tissue was impaired by ß-AR overstimulation and restored by MR blockade. These results suggest that activation of vascular MR signaling contributes to the vascular dysfunction induced by ß-AR overstimulation associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling. These findings reveal an additional explanation for the protective effects of MR antagonists in cardiovascular disorders with sympathetic activation.</p>

<p>This study aims to reveal the reason for the increased force of 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced contraction of endothelium-denuded skeletal muscle arteries of diabetic rats in the presence of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Our data on rat gracilis arteries show that i) PVAT of skeletal muscle arteries of healthy and diabetic rats releases hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), ii) higher concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine increase the production of H(2)O(2) in PVAT; iii) an enhanced PVAT production of H(2)O(2) is the main, if not the only, reason for the sensitization of arterial contraction to 5-hydroxytriptamine-induced contraction in diabetes and iv) endothelium antagonizes the effect of PVAT-derived H(2)O(2).</p>

<p>Obesity is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases and is characterized by abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue, including perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). However, brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation reduces visceral adiposity. To demonstrate that severe brown fat lipoatrophy might accelerate atherosclerotic process, we generated a new mouse model without insulin receptor (IR) in BAT and without apolipoprotein (Apo)E (BAT-specific IR knockout [BATIRKO];ApoE(-/-) mice) and assessed vascular and metabolic alterations associated to obesity. In addition, we analyzed the contribution of the adipose organ to vascular inflammation. Brown fat lipoatrophy induces visceral adiposity, mainly in gonadal depot (gonadal white adipose tissue [gWAT]), severe glucose intolerance, high postprandial glucose levels, and a severe defect in acute insulin secretion. BATIRKO;ApoE(-/-) mice showed greater hypertriglyceridemia than the obtained in ApoE(-/-) and hypercholesterolemia similar to ApoE(-/-) mice. BATIRKO;ApoE(-/-) mice, in addition to primary insulin resistance in BAT, also showed a significant decrease in insulin signaling in liver, gWAT, heart, aorta artery, and thoracic PVAT. More importantly, our results suggest that severe brown fat lipoatrophy aggravates the atherosclerotic process, characterized by a significant increase of lipid depots, atherosclerotic coverage, lesion size and complexity, increased macrophage infiltration, and proinflammatory markers expression. Finally, an increase of TNF-a and leptin as well as a decrease of adiponectin by BAT, gWAT, and thoracic PVAT might also be responsible of vascular damage. Our results suggest that severe brown lipoatrophy aggravates atherosclerotic process. Thus, BAT activation might protect against obesity and its associated metabolic alterations.</p>

<p>The seeding of scaffolds with adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments represents a promising strategy to establish a sufficient blood supply in tissue constructs. Herein, we analysed whether a single application of macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) at the implantation site further improves the early vascularisation of such microvessel-seeded constructs. Microvascular fragments were isolated from epididymal fat pads of C57BL/6 mice. The fragments were seeded on polyurethane scaffolds, which were implanted into mouse dorsal skinfold chambers exposed to MALP-2 or vehicle (control). The inflammatory host tissue response and the vascularisation of the scaffolds were analysed using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry. We found that the numbers of microvascular adherent leukocytes were significantly increased in MALP-2-treated chambers during the first 3 days after scaffold implantation when compared to controls. This temporary inflammation resulted in an improved vascularisation of the host tissue surrounding the implants, as indicated by a higher density of CD31-positive microvessels at day 14. However, the MALP-2-exposed scaffolds themselves presented with a lower functional microvessel density in their centre. In addition, in vitro analyses revealed that MALP-2 promotes apoptotic cell death of endothelial and perivascular cells in isolated microvascular fragments. Hence, despite the beneficial pro-angiogenic properties of MALP-2 at the implantation site, the herein evaluated approach may not be recommended to improve the vascularisation capacity of microvascular fragments in tissue engineering applications.</p>

<p>The adipose organ, which comprises brown, white and beige adipocytes, possesses remarkable plasticity in response to feeding and cold exposure. The development of beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT), a process called browning, represents a promising route to treat metabolic disorders. While surgical procedures constantly traumatize adipose tissue, its impact on adipocyte phenotype remains to be established. Herein, we studied the effect of trauma on adipocyte phenotype one day after sham, incision control, or surgical injury to the left inguinal adipose compartment. Caloric restriction was used to control for surgery-associated body temperature changes and weight loss. We characterized the trauma-induced cellular and molecular changes in subcutaneous, visceral, interscapular, and perivascular adipose tissue using histology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression, and flow cytometry analysis. After one day, surgical trauma stimulated adipose tissue browning at the site of injury and, importantly, in the contralateral inguinal depot. Browning was not present after incision only, and was largely independent of surgery-associated body temperature and weight loss. Adipose trauma rapidly recruited monocytes to the injured site and promoted alternatively activated macrophages. Conversely, PDGF receptor-positive beige progenitors were reduced. In this study, we identify adipose trauma as an unexpected driver of selected local and remote adipose tissue browning, holding important implications for the biologic response to surgical injury.</p>

<p>Vitamin D deficiency in human subjects is associated with hypertension, metabolic syndrome and related risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels correlate inversely with adiposity in obese and lean individuals. Bioactive vitamin D, or calcitriol, exerts anti-inflammatory effects on adipocytes, preadipocytes and macrophages in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency alters the phenotype of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) leading to impaired function in resistance artery. To examine the effects of vitamin D and PVAT on vascular reactivity, myograph experiments were performed on arteries, with or without intact PVAT, from mice maintained on vitamin D-deficient, vitamin D-sufficient or vitamin D-supplemented diet. Systolic blood pressure was significantly increased in mice on vitamin D-deficient diet. Importantly, vitamin D deficiency enhanced angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and impaired the normal ability of PVAT to suppress contractile responses of the underlying mesenteric resistance artery to angiotensin II and serotonin. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency caused upregulation of the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-a, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and its downstream target lysyl oxidase in mesenteric PVAT. Incubation of mesenteric arteries under hypoxic conditions impaired the anti-contractile effects of intact PVAT on those arteries from mice on vitamin D-sufficient diet. Vitamin D supplementation protected arteries against hypoxia-induced impairment of PVAT function. The protective effects of vitamin D against vascular dysfunction, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases may be mediated, at least in part, through regulation of inflammatory and hypoxia signaling pathways in PVAT.</p>

<p>The adipokine chemerin causes arterial contraction and is implicated in blood pressure regulation, especially in obese subjects with elevated levels of circulating chemerin. Because chemerin is expressed in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) that surrounds the sympathetic innervation of the blood vessel, we tested the hypothesis that chemerin (endogenous and exogenous) amplifies the sympathetic nervous system in mediating electrical field-stimulated (EFS) contraction. The superior mesenteric artery, with or without PVAT and with endothelium and sympathetic nerve intact, was mounted into isolated tissue baths and used for isometric contraction and stimulation. Immunohistochemistry validated a robust expression of chemerin in the PVAT surrounding the superior mesenteric artery. EFS (0.3-20 Hz) caused a frequency-dependent contraction in isolated arteries that was reduced by the chemerin receptor ChemR23 antagonist CCX832 alone (100 nM; with, but not without, PVAT), but not by the inactive congener CCX826 (100 nM). Exogenous chemerin-9 (1 µM)-amplified EFS-induced contraction in arteries (with and without PVAT) was blocked by CCX832 and the a-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin. CCX832 did not directly inhibit, nor did chemerin directly amplify, norepinephrine-induced contraction. Whole mount immunohistochemical experiments support colocalization of ChemR23 with the sympathetic nerve marker tyrosine hydroxylase in superior mesenteric PVAT and, to a lesser extent, in arteries and veins. These studies support the idea that exogenous chemerin modifies sympathetic nerve-mediated contraction through ChemR23 and that ChemR23 may be endogenously activated. This is significant because of the well-appreciated role of the sympathetic nervous system in blood pressure control.</p>

<p>Murine collagen-induced arthritis (mCIA) is characterized by decreased vascular constriction responses and increased MMP-9. Here, we describe additional histological alterations within the aorta and surrounding perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), study the role of PVAT in constriction response, and investigate the potential involvement of death receptor 3 (DR3). mCIA was induced in wild-type (WT) and DR3<sup>-/-</sup> mice with nonimmunized, age-matched controls. Vascular function was determined in isolated aortic rings ±PVAT, using isometric tension myography, in response to cumulative serotonin concentrations. Cellular expression of F4/80 (macrophages), Ly6G (neutrophils), DR3, and MMP-9 was determined using immunohistochemistry. In WTs, arthritis-induced vascular dysfunction was associated with increased F4/80+ macrophages and increased DR3 expression in the aorta and PVAT. MMP-9 was also up-regulated in PVAT, but did not correlate with alterations of PVAT intact constriction. DR3<sup>-/-</sup> mice inherently showed increased leukocyte numbers and MMP-9 expression in the PVAT, but retained the same nonarthritic constriction response as DR3WT mice ±PVAT. Arthritic DR3<sup>-/-</sup> mice had a worsened constriction response than DR3WT and showed an influx of neutrophils to the aorta and PVAT. Macrophage numbers were also up-regulated in DR3<sup>-/-</sup> PVAT. Despite this influx, PVAT intact DR3<sup>-/-</sup> constriction responses were restored to the same level as DR3WT. Impaired vascular constriction in inflammatory arthritis occurs independently of total MMP-9 levels, but correlates with macrophage and neutrophil ingress. Ablating DR3 worsens the associated vasculature dysfunction, however, DR3<sup>-/-</sup> PVAT is able to protect the aorta against aberrant vasoconstriction caused in this model.</p>

<p>This article describes phenotypes observed in a prediabetic population (i.e. a population with increased risk for type 2 diabetes) from data collected at the University hospital of Tübingen. We discuss the impact of genetic variation on insulin secretion, in particular the effect on compensatory hypersecretion, and the incretin-resistant phenotype of carriers of the gene variant TCF7L2 is described. Imaging studies used to characterise subphenotypes of fat distribution, metabolically healthy obesity and metabolically unhealthy obesity are described. Also discussed are ectopic fat stores in liver and pancreas that determine the phenotype of metabolically healthy and unhealthy fatty liver and the recently recognised phenotype of fatty pancreas. The metabolic impact of perivascular adipose tissue and pancreatic fat is discussed. The role of hepatokines, particularly that of fetuin-A, in the crosstalk between these organs is described. Finally, the role of brain insulin resistance in the development of the different prediabetes phenotypes is discussed.</p>

<p>What is more interesting about brown adipose tissue (BAT) is its ability to provide thermogenesis, protection against obesity by clearing triglycerides, releasing batokines, and mitigating insulin resistance. White adipose tissue (WAT) on the other hand stores excess energy and secretes some endocrine factors like leptin for regulating satiety. For the last decade there has been an increasing interest in the browning of fat keeping in view its beneficial effects on metabolic disorders and protection in the form of perivascular fat. Obesity is one such metabolic disorder that leads to significant morbidity and mortality from obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and cardiovascular disease risk. Browning of white fat paves the way to restrict obesity and obesity related disorders. Although exercise has been the most common factor for fat browning; however, there are other factors that involve: (1) beta aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA); (2) gamma amino butyric acid (GABA); (3) PPAR<U+0263> agonists; (4) JAK inhibition; and (5) IRISIN. In this review, we propose two novel factors musclin and TFAM for fat browning. Musclin a myokine released from muscles during exercise activates PPAR<U+0263> which induces browning of WAT that has beneficial metabolic and cardiac effects. TFAM is a transcription factor that induces mitochondrial biogenesis. Since BAT is rich in mitochondria, higher expression of TFAM in WAT or TFAM treatment in WAT cells can induce browning of WAT. We propose that fat browning can be used as a therapeutic tool for metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 61-68, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>

<p>Stem or progenitor cells are an essential component for the development, homeostasis, expansion, and regeneration of many tissues. Within white adipose tissue (WAT) reside vascular-resident adipose progenitor cells (APCs) that can proliferate and differentiate into either white or beige/brite adipocytes, which may control adiposity. Recent studies have begun to show that APCs can be manipulated to control adiposity and counteract ‘diabesity’. However, much remains unknown about the identity of APCs and how they may control adiposity in response to homeostatic and external cues. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of adipose progenitors and cover a range of topics, including the stem cell/progenitor lineage, their niche, their developmental and adult roles, and their role in cold-induced beige/brite adipocyte formation.</p>

<p>Angiogenesis plays crucial roles in various physiological processes including wound healing and tissue repair. It requires a tight interaction between endothelial cells and their surrounding environment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the non-endothelial cell types present in the perivascular environment, have been shown to secret exosomes to modulate intercellular communications between MSCs and their target cells. In this study, we initially isolated exosomes secreted by human adipose-derived MSCs (adMSC-Exo) and examined their roles in angiogenesis. We found that adMSC-Exo could be taken up by endothelial cells and significantly promote angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo Further study showed that miR-125a was enriched in adMSC-Exo, and repressed the expression of the angiogenic inhibitor delta-like 4 (DLL4) by targeting its 3’ untranslated region. Additionally, adMSC-Exo and its exosomal transferred miR-125a could repress DLL4 expression and modulate endothelial cell angiogenesis through promoting formation of endothelial tip cells. In conclusion, our study indicates that adMSC-Exo can transfer miR-125a to endothelial cells and promote angiogenesis by repressing DLL4. adMSC-Exo, as a pro-angiogenic factor, might be a promising candidate for therapeutical tissue repair.</p>

<p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases a variety of factors that affect vascular function. PVAT in the thoracic aorta shares characteristics with the brown adipose tissue, including a large amount of mitochondria. PVAT-derived factors influence both endothelial and smooth muscle function via several signaling mechanisms including the release/generation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Considering the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on vascular function and that mitochondria are an important source of ROS, we hypothesized that mitochondria-derived ROS in the PVAT modulates vascular reactivity. Vascular reactivity to norephinephrine (NE) was evaluated in thoracic aortic rings, with or without endothelium and/or PVAT, from male Wistar rats. Mitochondrial uncoupling, as well as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) removal, increased the contraction in vessels surrounded by PVAT. PVAT stimulated with NE exhibited increased protein expression, determined by Western blot analysis, of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and decreased protein expression of catalase. Ultimately, NE increased superoxide anion (O2(-)) generation in PVAT via increases in intracellular calcium. These results clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) in PVAT contributes to modulation of aortic muscle contraction by generating higher amounts of O2(-) that is, in turn, dismutated to hydrogen peroxide, which then acts as a pivotal signaling molecule regulating vascular smooth muscle contraction.</p>

<p>The present study was designed to determine whether sulfur dioxide (SO2) could be endogenously produced in adipocyte and served as a novel adipocyte-derived inflammatory inhibitor. SO2 was detected in adipose tissue using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. SO2 synthase aspartate aminotransferase (AAT1 and AAT2) mRNA and protein expressions in adipose tissues were measured. For in vitro study, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured, infected with adenovirus carrying AAT1 gene or lentivirus carrying shRNA to AAT1, and then treated with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). We found that endogenous SO2/AAT pathway existed in adipose tissues including perivascular, perirenal, epididymal, subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue. AAT1 overexpression significantly increased SO2 production and inhibited TNF-a-induced inflammatory factors, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By contrast, AAT1 knockdown decreased SO2 production and exacerbated TNF-a-stimulated MCP-1 and IL-8 secretion. Mechanistically, AAT1 overexpression attenuated TNF-a-induced I<U+03BA>Ba phosphorylation and degradation, and nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) p65 phosphorylation, while AAT1 knockdown aggravated TNF-a-activated NF-<U+03BA>B pathway, which was blocked by SO2. NF-<U+03BA>B inhibitors, PDTC or Bay 11-7082, abolished excessive p65 phosphorylation and adipocyte inflammation induced by AAT1 knockdown. This is the first report to suggest that endogenous SO2 is a novel adipocyte-derived inflammatory inhibitor.</p>

<p>The use of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has emerged as a possible therapeutic strategy for CNS-related conditions. Research in the last decade strongly suggests that MSC-mediated benefits are closely related with their secretome. Studies published in recent years have shown that the secretome of hMSCs isolated from different tissue sources may present significant variation. With this in mind, the present work performed a comparative proteomic-based analysis through mass spectrometry on the secretome of hMSCs derived from bone marrow (BMSCs), adipose tissue (ASCs), and human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs). The results revealed that BMSCs, ASCs, and HUCPVCs differed in their secretion of neurotrophic, neurogenic, axon guidance, axon growth, and neurodifferentiative proteins, as well as proteins with neuroprotective actions against oxidative stress, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity, which have been shown to be involved in several CNS disorder/injury processes. Although important changes were observed within the secretome of the cell populations that were analyzed, all cell populations shared the capability of secreting important neuroregulatory molecules. The difference in their secretion pattern may indicate that their secretome is specific to a condition of the CNS. Nevertheless, the confirmation that the secretome of MSCs isolated from different tissue sources is rich in neuroregulatory molecules represents an important asset not only for the development of future neuroregenerative strategies but also for their use as a therapeutic option for human clinical trials.</p>

<p>Renal sinus fat is partially characteristic of peri-vascular adipose tissue, however, RSF volume (RSFV) is associated with visceral adipose tissue (VATV). Therefore, the ratio of RSFV to VATV (RSFV/VATV ratio) can distinguish the importance of RSF as an extension of VAT versus its perivascular effects. We assessed the association of RSFV/VATV ratio with coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in 189 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. RSFV of the right kidney and VATV were quantified by using image data of unenhanced abdominal CT. CACS were measured on unenhanced ECG-gated CT images. This article contains data on explanatory scheme of how to measure RSFV on unenhanced abdominal CT, CT indication and exclusion criteria of study population, sex-adjusted association between RSFV with risk factors of coronary vascular diseases and metabolic indices, multivariate linear regression analysis with CACS as the dependent variable in the total study population. The data are supplemental to our original research article describing detailed association between RSFV/VATV ratio and CACS including sub-groups analyses classified by the age of 70 “Renal sinus fat volume on computed tomography in middle-aged patients at risk for cardiovascular disease and its association with coronary artery calcification” Murakami et al.

<p>Cardiovascular diseases are major contributors to global deaths and disability-adjusted life years, with hypertension a significant risk factor for all causes of death. The endothelium that lines the inner wall of the vasculature regulates essential haemostatic functions, such as vascular tone, circulation of blood cells, inflammation and platelet activity. Endothelial dysfunction is an early predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events. We review the prognostic value of obtaining measurements of endothelial function, the clinical techniques for its determination, the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction and the therapeutic treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Since vascular oxidative stress and inflammation are major determinants of endothelial function, we have also addressed current antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. In the light of recent data that dispute the prognostic value of endothelial function in healthy human cohorts, we also discuss alternative diagnostic parameters such as vascular stiffness index and intima/media thickness ratio. We also suggest that assessing vascular function, including that of smooth muscle and even perivascular adipose tissue, may be an appropriate parameter for clinical investigations.This article is part of a themed section on Redox Biology and Oxidative Stress in Health and Disease.

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) exerts an anticontractile effect in response to various vasoconstrictor agonists, and this is lost in obesity. A recent study reported that bariatric surgery reverses the damaging effects of obesity on PVAT function.

A recent study reported that bariatric surgery reverses the damaging effects of obesity on PVAT function. However, PVAT function has not been characterized after weight loss induced by caloric restriction, which is often the first line treatment for obesity.Contractility studies were performed using wire myography on small mesenteric arteries with and without PVAT from control, diet-induced obese, calorie restricted and sustained weight loss rats. Changes in the PVAT environment were assessed using immunohistochemistry. PVAT from healthy animals elicited an anticontractile effect in response to norepinephrine. This was abolished in diet-induced obesity through a mechanism involving increased local tumor necrosis factor-a and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability within PVAT. Sustained weight loss led to improvement in PVAT function associated with restoration of adipocyte size, reduced tumor necrosis factor-a, and increased nitric oxide synthase function. This was associated with reversal of obesity-induced hypertension and normalization of plasma adipokine levels, including leptin and insulin.</AbstractText>: Contractility studies were performed using wire myography on small mesenteric arteries with and without PVAT from control, diet-induced obese, calorie restricted and sustained weight loss rats.

<p>OBJECTIVES: Although the microcirculatory dysfunctions of edema formation are well documented, the draining pattern of dermal edema lacks information. This study was to assess the potential drainage pathways of the interstitial fluid in patients with ankle edema using the anatomical and histological methods.METHODS AND RESULTS: Four amputees of lower leg participated in this study. Fluorescent imaging agent was injected into lateral ankle dermis in one volunteered patient before the amputation and three lower legs after the amputation. Physiologically in the volunteer or enhanced by cyclical compression on three amputated limbs, several fluorescent longitudinal pathways from ankle dermis to the broken end of the amputated legs were subsequently visualized and studied using histological methods, laser confocal microscopy and electron microscopy methods respectively. Interestingly, the fluorescent pathways confirmed to be fibrous connective tissues and the presence of two types: those of the cutaneous pathway (located in dermis or the interlobular septum among adipose tissues within the hypodermis) and those of the perivascular pathway (located in connective tissues surrounding the veins and the arteries). The intrinsic three-dimensional architecture of each fluorescent pathway was the longitudinally running and interconnected fibril bundles, upon which, an interfacial transport pathway within connective tissues was visualized by fluorescein.CONCLUSIONS: The current anatomical data suggested that a unique long-distance transport pathway composed of oriented fibrous connective tissues might play a pathophysiological role in draining dermal edema besides vascular circulations and provide novel understandings of general fibrous connective tissues in life science.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of diagnosing fatal pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) with unenhanced postmortem computed tomography (PMCT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cases with autopsy confirmed PTE and matched controls (n=19) were retrospectively examined for PTE signs on PMCT. The following variables were evaluated: edema of the lower extremities (areal and Hounsfield Unit measurements) and observer dependent patterns of the morphology of the sedimentation in the pulmonary arteries and trunk.RESULTS: The median absolute difference between the areal measurements of the right and left lower leg and thigh and the attenuation of the popliteal adipose tissue did not differ significantly between the groups. In contrast, the categorical assessment of soft tissue edema in the lower extremities was significantly different. A statistically significant difference could also be found in the shape of the vascular content within the pulmonary trunk and arteries.CONCLUSION: PTE may be assessed on unenhanced PMCT using diagnostic clues such as a distinct pattern of the pulmonary artery content and the presence of perivascular edema in the lower extremities.</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome is a complex of disorders that includes visceral obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It is characterized by an increased risk for serious cardiovascular events. Adipocytes are now recognized to contribute to the development of cardiovascular complications in metabolic syndrome via the release of several bioactive substances (adipocytokines). Obesity induces an increase in the volume of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which is located outside the blood vessels. In recent years, PVAT has been reported to produce/release vasoactive adipocytokines. Thus, PVAT can modulate vasomotor function by releasing vasorelaxing/vasocontracting factors, resulting in the development of cardiovascular disease due to metabolic syndrome. By using animal models (SHR/NDmcr-cp rats, SHRSP.Z-Lepr(fa)/IzmDmcr rats, and B6.BKS (D)-Lepr(fa)/J mice), we have demonstrated that chronic oxidative-nitrative stress is closely linked to the development of vascular dysfunction in response to nitric oxide (NO) in resistant arteries with increasing age/exposure to metabolic abnormalities. Further, our recent findings have led us to believe that PVAT helps in the regulation of vasodilation to compensate for the impaired vasodilation observed in pathophysiological conditions in the mesenteric arteries of SHRSP.Z-Lepr(fa)/IzmDmcr rats. However, a breakdown of the compensatory system occurs with long-term exposure to metabolic abnormalities. We propose the concept of the functional regulation of vascular tissue by PVAT in metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue is an attractive source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as it is largely dispensable and readily accessible through minimally invasive procedures such as liposuction. Until recently MSC could only be isolated in a process involving ex-vivo culture and their in-vivo identity, location and frequency remained elusive. We have documented that pericytes (CD45-, CD146+, and CD34-) and adventitial cells (CD45-, CD146-, CD34+) (collectively termed perivascular stem cells or PSC) represent native ancestors of the MSC, and can be prospectively purified using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). In this study we describe an optimized protocol that aims to deliver pure, viable and consistent yields of PSC from adipose tissue. We analysed the frequency of PSC within adipose tissue, and the effect of patient and procedure based variables on this yield.METHODS: Within this twin centre study we analysed the adipose tissue of n = 131 donors using flow cytometry to determine the frequency of PSC and correlate this with demographic and processing data such as age, sex, BMI and cold storage time of the tissue.RESULTS: The mean number of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from 100 ml of lipoaspirate was 34.4 million. Within the SVF, mean cell viability was 83 %, with 31.6 % of cells being haematopoietic (CD45+). Adventitial cells and pericytes represented 33.0 % and 8 % of SVF cells respectively. Therefore, a 200 ml lipoaspirate would theoretically yield 23.2 million viable prospectively purified PSC - sufficient for many reconstructive and regenerative applications. Minimal changes were observed in respect to age, sex and BMI suggesting universal potential application.CONCLUSIONS: Adipose tissue contains two anatomically and phenotypically discreet populations of MSC precursors - adventitial cells and pericytes - together referred to as perivascular stem cells (PSC). More than 9 million PSC per 100 ml of lipoaspirate can be rapidly purified to homogeneity using flow cytometry in clinically relevant numbers potentially circumventing the need for purification and expansion by culture prior to clinical use. The number and viability of PSC are minimally affected by patient age, sex, BMI or the storage time of the tissue, but the quality and consistency of yield can be significantly influenced by procedure based variables.</p>

<p>In adipose tissue mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) contributes to the regulation of glucose/lipid metabolism and inflammatory molecule expression. Both processes display diurnal variations during the course of the day. RICTOR and mSIN1 are unique and essential components of mTORC2, which is activated by growth factors including insulin. To assess whether mTORC2 components display diurnal variations, we analyzed steady state mRNA expression levels of Rictor, mSin1, and mTor in various adipose tissues during a 24 h period. Diurnally regulated expression of Rictor was detected in brown adipose tissues displaying highest mRNA expression levels at the beginning of the 12 h light period (zeitgeber time 2, ZT2). Gene expression patterns of mSin1 and mTor displayed a similar diurnal regulation as Rictor in PVAT while smaller changes were detected for these genes in aorta during the course of the day. Basal mTORC2 activity was measured by phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) a at serine 657 was higher at ZT14 as compared with ZT2 in PVAT. In line, gene expression of inflammatory molecules nitric oxide synthase 2 and tumor necrosis factor a was lower at ZT 14 compared to ZT2. Our findings provide evidence for a diurnal regulation of expression of mTORC2 components and activity. Hence, mTORC2 is possibly an integral part of diurnally regulated signaling pathways in PVAT and possibly in other adipose tissues.</p>

We systematically investigated roles of FABP4 in the development of coronary artery atherosclerosis.First, by immunohistochemical analyses, we found that FABP4 was expressed in macrophages within coronary atherosclerotic plaques and epicardial/perivascular fat in autopsy cases and macrophages within thrombi covering ruptured coronary plaques in thrombectomy samples from patients with acute myocardial infarction. Second, we confirmed that FABP4 was secreted from macrophages and adipocytes cultured in vitro. Third, we investigated the effect of exogenous FABP4 on macrophages and human coronary artery-derived smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in vitro. Treatment of the cells with recombinant FABP4 significantly increased gene expression of inflammatory markers in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we measured serum FABP4 level in the aortic root (Ao-FABP4) and coronary sinus (CS-FABP4) of 34 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. Coronary stenosis score assessed by the modified Gensini score was weakly correlated with CS-FABP4 but was not correlated with Ao-FABP4. A stronger correlation (r=0.59, P&lt;0.01) was observed for the relationship between coronary stenosis score and coronary veno-arterial difference in FABP4 level, (CS-Ao)-FABP4, indicating local production of FABP4 during coronary circulation in the heart.

<p>Bariatric surgery (BS) in severely obese subjects causes a significant reduction of body weight with lung function improvement. We have shown that abnormalities in pulmonary gas exchange in morbidly obese subjects are substantially improved with BS. These abnormalities were thought to be related to reduced lung volumes as well as to abnormal endothelial function induced by low-grade chronic inflammation linked to perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). In this study, we used computed tomography (CT) to assess whether BS also caused measurable structural changes in the lung tissue volume (Vtiss) and cross-sectional vessel analysis, hypothesizing that these measures could be related to the previously reported lung functional changes.</AbstractText>: Bariatric surgery (BS) in severely obese subjects causes a significant reduction of body weight with lung function improvement.

<p>Endothelium modulates vascular function and structure, mainly by production of nitric oxide which protects the vasculature against the development of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Abdominal obesity is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, caused by a reduced nitric oxide availability secondary to an enhanced oxidative stress production. Pro-inflammatory cytokine generation is a major mechanism whereby obesity is associated with a reduced NO availability. In healthy conditions, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) secretes factors that influence vasodilation by increasing NO availability. Such protective effect is lost in PVAT from obese subjects, which in turn is switched towards a functionally active pro-contractile inflammation source, causing a reduction of vascular NO availability and contributing to the endothelin-1/NO imbalance. In such context, vasculature not only represents a main target of PVAT-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines, but is also considered as important source of low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress which, together with the PVAT, contribute to endothelial dysfunction which characterizes obese patients.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes and its major risk factor, obesity, are an increasing worldwide health problem. The exact mechanisms that link obesity with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular complications and renal diseases, are still not clarified sufficiently. Adipose tissue in general is an active endocrine and paracrine organ that may influence the development of these disorders. Excessive body fat in general obesity may also cause quantitative and functional alterations of specific adipose tissue compartments. Beside visceral and subcutaneous fat depots which exert systemic effects by the release of adipokines, cytokines and hormones, there are also locally acting fat depots such as peri- and epicardial fat, perivascular fat, and renal sinus fat. Perivascular adipose tissue is in close contact with the adventitia of large, medium and small diameter arteries, possesses unique features differing from other fat depots and may act also independently of general obesity. An increasing number of studies are dealing with the “good” or “bad” characteristics and functions of normally sized and dramatically increased perivascular fat mass in lean or heavily obese individuals. This review describes the origin of perivascular adipose tissue, its different locations, the dual role of a physiological and unphysiological fat mass and its impact on diabetes, cardiovascular and renal diseases. Clinical studies, new imaging methods, as well as basic research in cell culture experiments in the last decade helped to elucidate the various aspects of the unique fat compartment.</p>

<p>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in culture are derived from BM stromal cells or skeletal stem cells. Whereas MSCs have been exploited in clinical medicine, the identification of MSC-specific markers has been limited. Here, we report that a cell surface and secreted protein, Meflin, is expressed in cultured MSCs, fibroblasts and pericytes, but not other types of cells including epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In vivo, Meflin is expressed by immature osteoblasts and chondroblasts. In addition, Meflin is found on stromal cells distributed throughout the BM, and on pericytes and perivascular cells in multiple organs. Meflin maintains the undifferentiated state of cultured MSCs and is downregulated upon their differentiation, consistent with the observation that Meflin-deficient mice exhibit increased number of osteoblasts and accelerated bone development. In the bone and BM, Meflin is more highly expressed in primitive stromal cells that express platelet-derived growth factor receptor a and Sca-1 than the Sca-1-negative adipo-osteogenic progenitors, which create a niche for hematopoiesis. Those results are consistent with a decrease in the number of clonogenic colony-forming unit-fibroblasts within the BM of Meflin-deficient mice. These preliminary data suggest that Meflin is a potential marker for cultured MSCs and their source cells in vivo.</p>

<p>Beta3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) mediates vessel relaxation in the endothelium while it modulates lipolysis in the adipose tissue. However, the function and regulation mechanism of ADRB3 in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), especially in hypertension, is still unclear. We show that ADRB3 protein is upregulated in the PVAT of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) hypertensive mice, with the characteristics of PVAT browning and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. Inhibition of ADRB3 with selective antagonist SR59230A caused serious vascular injury in vivo, even though UCP1 expression was downregulated. ADRB3 protein was regulated by let-7b, which was decreased in the PVAT of the DOCA-salt group. These data reveal that ADRB3 in PVAT contributes to vascular function in the progression of hypertension.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds most vessels in the human body. Healthy PVAT has a vasorelaxant effect which is not observed in obesity. We assessed the contribution of nitric oxide (NO), inflammation and endothelium to obesity-induced PVAT damage.METHODS: Rats were fed a high-fat diet or normal chow. PVAT function was assessed using wire myography. Skeletonised and PVAT-intact mesenteric vessels were prepared with and without endothelium. Vessels were incubated with L-NNA or superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. Gluteal fat biopsies were performed on 10 obese and 10 control individuals, and adipose tissue was assessed using proteomic analysis.RESULTS: In the animals, there were significant correlations between weight and blood pressure (BP; r = 0.5, p = 0.02), weight and PVAT function (r = 0.51, p = 0.02), and PVAT function and BP (r = 0.53, p = 0.01). PVAT-intact vessel segments from healthy animals constricted significantly less than segments from obese animals (p &lt; 0.05). In a healthy state, there was preservation of the PVAT vasorelaxant function after endothelium removal (p &lt; 0.05). In endothelium-denuded vessels, L-NNA attenuated the PVAT vasorelaxant function in control vessels (p &lt; 0.0001). In obesity, incubation with SOD and catalase attenuated PVAT-intact vessel contractility in the presence and absence of endothelium (p &lt; 0.001). In obese humans, SOD [Cu-Zn] (SOD1; fold change -2.4), peroxiredoxin-1 (fold change -2.15) and adiponectin (fold change -2.1) were present in lower abundances than in healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS: Incubation with SOD and catalase restores PVAT vasorelaxant function in animal obesity. In the rodent model, obesity-induced PVAT damage is independent of endothelium and is in part due to reduced NO bioavailability within PVAT. Loss of PVAT function correlates with rising BP in our animal obesity model. In keeping with our hypothesis of inflammation-induced damage to PVAT function in obesity, there are lower levels of SOD1, peroxiredoxin-1 and adiponectin in obese human PVAT.</p>

<p>Cold-associated perniosis of the thighs (“equestrian cold panniculitis”) is an unusual and still enigmatic entity. The authors retrieved 6 cases for a re-evaluation of their clinicopathologic features and for an immunohistochemical assessment with antibodies anti-CD3, anti-CD20, and anti-CD123. All patients were women, aged 17-45 years. One of them had elevated antinuclear antibody titers. Available anamnestic data confirmed the triggering role of prolonged/intermittent exposure to cold (not necessarily for equestrian activities). The lesions affected the thighs, with a preferential, although not exclusive involvement of the upper lateral surface. The histopathological pattern was perivascular, superficial, and deep, extending toward the superficial fat lobules, with lymphocytic vasculitis and mucin deposition; clumps of CD123 cells were found in 4 of 6 cases. Cold-associated perniosis of the thighs cannot be considered as a panniculitis. The histopathological features considerably overlap with perniosis at other sites of the body and with chilblain lupus erythematosus.</p>

<p>Recent studies have emphasized the role of perivascular inflammation in cardiovascular disease. We studied mechanisms of perivascular leukocyte infiltration in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension and their links to vascular dysfunction. Chronic Ang II infusion in mice increased immune cell content of T cells (255 ± 130 to 1664 ± 349 cells/mg; P &lt; 0.01), M1 and M2 macrophages, and dendritic cells in perivascular adipose tissue. In particular, the content of T lymphocytes bearing CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 1, CCR3, and CCR5 receptors for RANTES chemokine was increased by Ang II (CCR1, 15.6 ± 1.5% vs. 31 ± 5%; P &lt; 0.01). Hypertension was associated with an increase in perivascular adipose tissue expression of the chemokine RANTES (relative quantification, 1.2 ± 0.2 vs. 3.5 ± 1.1; P &lt; 0.05), which induced T-cell chemotaxis and vascular accumulation of T cells expressing the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5. Mechanistically, RANTES(-/-) knockout protected against vascular leukocyte, and in particular T lymphocyte infiltration (26 ± 5% in wild type Ang II vs. 15 ± 4% in RANTES(-/-)), which was associated with protection from endothelial dysfunction induced by Ang II. This effect was linked with diminished infiltration of IFN-<U+03B3>-producing CD8(+) and double-negative CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells in perivascular space and reduced vascular oxidative stress while FoxP3(+) T-regulatory cells were unaltered. IFN-<U+03B3> ex vivo caused significant endothelial dysfunction, which was reduced by superoxide anion scavenging. In a human cohort, a significant inverse correlation was observed between circulating RANTES levels as a biomarker and vascular function measured as flow-mediated dilatation (R = -0.3, P &lt; 0.01) or endothelial injury marker von Willebrand factor (R = +0.3; P &lt; 0.01). Thus, chemokine RANTES is important in the regulation of vascular dysfunction through modulation of perivascular inflammation.-Mikolajczyk, T.

<p>The present investigation examined the effect of pregnancy on the anticontractile effect of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on the rat. Ring segments of the aorta, with and without PVAT, were set up in organ baths for isometric tension recording. In both groups, concentration-response curves to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were displaced to the right with a reduction of the maximum response in aorta segments with PVAT. The anticontractile effect of PVAT was attenuated on segments from pregnant rats. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), an inhibitor of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, enhanced 5-HT-induced contractions of aorta segments from pregnant and nonpregnant rats only when PVAT was attached. There was no difference in the effect of 4-aminopyridine on 5-HT-induced contractions of aorta segments with PVAT from pregnant and nonpregnant rats. There was also no significant difference in the expression of Kv7.4 channels in aorta segments (with PVAT) between pregnant and nonpregnant rats. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) was detected in PVAT from pregnant and nonpregnant rats. The level of TNF-a was significantly greater in PVAT from pregnant rats. Treatment of pregnant rats with pentoxyphyline significantly reduced the level of TNF-a in the PVAT and restored the anticontractile effect of PVAT on aorta segments from pregnant rats. Finally, TNF-a (10 ng/mL) potentiated 5-HT-induced contractions of PVAT-containing pregnant rat aorta. These results would suggest that the loss of anticontractile effect of PVAT in pregnant rat aorta could be due to enhanced production of TNF-a in the PVAT in these rats.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Renal sinus fat (RSF) behaves as one of the perivascular fats, however RSF volume (RSFV) is considerably affected by visceral adipose tissue volume (VTAV). The ratio of RSFV to VATV (RSFV/VATV ratio) can be an index of regional perivascular fat accumulation corrected for the influence of VATV. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between RSFV/VATV ratio and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.METHODS: One hundred and eighty-nine patients (mean age 66.7 ± 10.2; 72% men) underwent ECG-gated cardiac computed tomography (CT) and unenhanced abdominal CT. CAC score (CACS) was assessed using axial CT images. RSFV was measured by partially manipulated segmentation of the right kidney. VATV was automatically quantified in the upper abdomen. Logistic and correlation analyses were performed to examine the correlations between CAC, RSFV/VATV ratio, and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in total and subgroups classified by the patients’ age.RESULTS: Log-transformed RSFV/VATV ratio was associated with CAC presence in 112 middle-aged patients less than 69 years of age as well as total. This association remained significant after multivariate adjustment only in the middle-aged patients (OR 15.9, 95% CI 1.15-218.8). In total, RSFV/VATV ratio (r = 0.228, p = 0.002) and age (r = 0.316, p &lt; 0.001) correlated with CACS on univariate analyses, but only age correlated on multivariate analyses. RSFV/VATV ratio correlated with CACS in the middle-aged patients (r = 0.418, p &lt; 0.001), as well as on multivariate analyses.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that RSFV/VATV could be an independent risk indicator of CAC in the middle-aged patients.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Angiomyolipoma is a benign mesenchymal tumor composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle, adipose tissue and thick-walled blood vessels, and usually named PEComas (perivascular epithelioid cell tumors). PEComas share overlapping histopathological features with epithelioid cells along a perivascular distribution and characteristic immunohistochemistry with coexpression of myoid and melanocytic markers (HMB-45 /or Melan-A). We report the first case of primary orbital angiomyolipoma with negative melanocytic marker.CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old Asian woman had a 2-year history of progressive swelling in the left upper eyelid. External examination revealed 3 cm of relative proptosis of the left eye and a palpable mass in the left superonasal orbit. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated a circumscribed, heterogeneous orbital mass. Excision biopsy was done and the histological finding demonstrated the orbital mass was composed of mature adipocytes, intermingled with spindle or oval-shaped cells, and accompanied by thick-walled blood vessels. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for CD34 and HHF-35, but negative for cytokeratin, HMB-45 and Melan-A. The diagnosis of angiomyolipoma was made. No recurrence was noted at 2-year follow-up.CONCLUSION: In our case, the HMB-45 negativity may be explained by the rarity of the epithelioid cells, and the HMB-45 positivity is often weaker or absent in spindle cells. Angiomyolipoma, although rare, should be added to the differential diagnosis of space-occupying orbital lesion.</p>

<p>Peritonitis carcinomatosa is an advanced and intractable state of gastrointestinal and ovarian cancer, where mechanistic elucidation might enable the development of more effective therapies. Peritoneal dissemination of this type of malignancy has been generally thought to initiate from “milky spots” of primitive lymphoid tissues in the peritoneal cavity. In this study, we offer evidence challenging this idea, based on the finding that tumor implantation and directional dissemination was not required for the presence of milky spots, but rather SCF/CXCL12-expressing niche-like cells located at the border regions of perivascular adipose tissue. Interestingly, we found that peritoneal cavity lavage fluid, which specifically contains peritoneal collagen type IV and plasma fibronectin, dramatically facilitated spheroid formation of murine and human colon cancer cells. Spheroid formation strongly induced the expression of CXCR4 in an Sp1-dependent manner to promote niche-directed metastasis. Notably, disrupting sphere formation or inhibiting Sp1 activity was sufficient to suppress tumor dissemination and potentiated chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil. Our findings illuminate mechanisms of peritoneal cancer dissemination and highlight the Sp1/CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling axis as a rational target for the development of therapeutics to manage this intractable form of malignancy.</p>

<p>The effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) on venous wall structure was studied in the rabbit model. Special setup was developed for ultrasound generation and vessel targeting. Methods. The essential part of the setup is spherical focusing power irradiator with following characteristics: power supply voltage of 25 V, frequency of 1.9 MHz, ultrasound intensity in the focal spot ~8.7 kW/cm2. Results. Single 15-s exposure of the femoral vein to HIFU resulted in partial desquamation of the endothelium, vacuolization of myocyte cytoplasm, misarrangement and coagulation of collagen fibers. Pulsed HIFU (5 pulses for 5 s each) caused protein coagulation in all layers of venous wall (v. cava posterior) as well as the appearance of the areas of fibrinoid necrosis, severe endothelial desquamation, and intimal detachment. HIFU-induced collagen structural changes in media and adventitia of the vein suggest that HIFU exposure resulted in local temperature increase up to ~60°<U+0421>. In some experiments, adjacent to the vein muscles were also exposed to HIFU. In this case, edema of the interstitium and muscle fibers was registered, as well as fragmentation and coagulation of some fibers, altered staining patterns and neutrophil infiltration. These changes could be attributed to the development of acute muscle injury (acute fasciitis). Perivascular adipose tissue also demonstrated edema and lipolysis, red blood cell diapedesis, and leukocyte infiltration. Conclusion. The observations on structural changes in the venous wall after HIFU exposure could lay the ground for future experiments on HIFU - mediated obliteration.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of disability in the US. Consequently, there is a pressing need for restoring the structural and functional properties of diseased articular cartilage. Yet the search for the right combination of proper target cells and growth factors for cartilage regeneration remains challenging. In this study, we first tested the intrinsic chondrogenic differentiation ability of human perivascular stem cells (hPSCs), a novel source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from human adipose tissue. A putative prochondrogenic growth factor, NEL-like molecule-1 (NELL-1), was added to the hPSC pellets to upregulate gene expression of chondrogenic markers, including AGGRECAN, COLLAGEN II, and COMP. Furthermore, the addition of NELL-1 to a transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-ß3) + bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) “cocktail” resulted in the best combinatorial stimulation in accelerating the chondrogenic differentiation of hPSCs, as evidenced by increased gene and protein expression of chondrogenic markers in a shortened induction time without elevating expression of hypertrophic, fibrotic, and osteogenic markers. Mechanistically, this acceleration rendered by NELL-1 may be partially attributed to NELL-1’s upregulation of BMP receptors and TGF-ß receptor type I in hPSCs for increased responsiveness to BMPs + TGF-ßs. In conclusion, lipoaspirate-derived hPSCs present a novel and abundant cell source of MSCs for cartilage regeneration, and the combinatorial application of NELL-1, TGF-ß3, and BMP-6 with hPSCs may remarkably enhance and accelerate cartilage repair.</p>

<p>Interesting and stimulating data about the effect of the perivascular adipose tissue size on atherogenesis are based mainly on CT findings. We studied this topic by directly analyzing perivascular adipose tissue in explanted hearts from patients undergoing transplantation. Ninety-six consecutive patients were included, including 58 with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD) and 38 with dilation cardiomyopathy (DCMP). The area of perivascular fat, area of the coronary artery wall, and ratio of CD68-positive macrophages within the perivascular fat and within the vascular wall were quantified by immunohistochemistry. There was no significant difference in the perivascular adipose tissue size between the two groups. Nevertheless, there was a significantly higher number of macrophages in the coronary arterial wall of CHD patients. In addition, we found a close relationship between the ratio of macrophages in the arterial wall and adjacent perivascular adipose tissue in the CHD group, but not in the DCMP group. According to our data interaction between macrophages in the arterial wall and macrophages in surrounding adipose tissue could be more important mechanism of atherogenesis than the size of this tissue itself.</p>

<p>Renal transplantation is associated with a large number of risk factors that can have an influence on early renal graft function (ERGF). One of these factors could be the increasing number of obese kidney donors. The mechanisms of reduced ERGF in obese kidney donors are still poorly understood. To that end, we compared ERGF in recipients with body mass index (BMI), perivascular fat and plasma inflammation markers of live kidney donors. We hypothesized that the BMI of donors would negatively correlate with an average increase of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and that it would also be associated with increased perivascular and plasma inflammation markers in the first seven days after transplantation. Between January 2013 and December 2014, some 58 living kidney transplantation pairs were included in the study. Donor and recipient demographic data, preoperative BMI, blood C-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin levels, perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) samples and recipient blood creatinine levels were analyzed. The median CRP of donors was 0.68 mg/l (max: 8.66 mg/l, min: 0.33 mg/l), the median of M1 macrophages (CD14+CD16+) in one gram of PAT was 5940 (max: 41 100, min: 248) and the median of adiponectin was 411 930 pg/ml (max: 14 217 000, min: 167 300) in plasma. We did not find any association between early renal graft function and the percentage of M1 macrophages in donor perirenal adipose tissue (p=0.83, r=0.03, n=58), adiponectin (p=0.65, r=0.06, n=58) or CRP (p=0.16, r=0.2, n=58) in plasma. The obesity level of donors, expressed as BMI, did not correlate with early renal graft function in the first seven days after transplantation. The associations between ERGF and plasma and perivascular fat inflammation markers were not significant. We confirmed a negative correlation between the BMI of recipients and an average increase of GFR in the first seven days after transplantation (p&lt;0.02, r=-0.325, N=58). We confirmed a negative correlation of adiponectin plasma concentration to the BMI of donors.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is an atypical fat depot surrounding the heart with a putative role in the development of atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: We profiled genes and miRNAs in perivascular EAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of metabolically healthy patients without coronary artery disease (CAD) vs. metabolic patients with CAD. Compared with SAT, a specific tuning of miRNAs and genes points to EAT as a tissue characterized by a metabolically active and pro-inflammatory profile. Then, we depicted both miRNA and gene signatures of EAT in CAD, featuring a down-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, nuclear receptor transcriptional activity, and an up-regulation of those involved in antigen presentation, chemokine signalling, and inflammation. Finally, we identified miR-103-3p as candidate modulator of CCL13 in EAT, and a potential biomarker role for the chemokine CCL13 in CAD.CONCLUSION: EAT in CAD is characterized by changes in the regulation of metabolism and inflammation with miR-103-3p/CCL13 pair as novel putative actors in EAT function and CAD.</p>

<p>AIMS: T-regulatory lymphocyte (Treg) adoptive transfer prevented angiotensin (Ang) II-induced hypertension and microvascular injury. Scurfy mice are deficient in Treg because of a mutation in the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) gene. Enhanced Ang II effects in the absence of Treg would unambiguously demonstrate their vascular protective role. We hypothesized that adoptive transfer of Scurfy vs. wild-type T cells will exacerbate Ang II-induced microvascular damage in T and B-cell-deficient recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1) knockout mice.METHODS AND RESULTS: Rag1 knockout mice were injected with vehicle, 10(7) T cells from wild-type or Scurfy mice or 10 (6)wild-type Treg alone or in combination with Scurfy T cells, and then infused or not with Ang II (490<U+200A>ng/kg per min, subcutaneous) for 14 days. Ang II increased SBP in all the groups, but DBP only in wild-type and Scurfy T-cell groups. Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) of mesenteric arteries of the wild-type T-cell group, whereas these were exaggerated in the Scurfy T-cell group. Ang II enhanced microvascular remodeling and stiffness in vehicle and Scurfy T-cell groups. Ang II increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression in the vascular wall and PVAT, monocyte/macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory polarization in PVAT and the renal cortex, and T-cell infiltration in the renal cortex only in the Scurfy T-cell group. Treg coinjection in the vehicle and Scurfy T-cell groups prevented or reduced the effects of Ang II.CONCLUSION: FOXP3+ Treg deficiency exaggerates Ang II-induced microvascular injury by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses.</p>

<p>The expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) in obesity involves de novo differentiation of new adipocytes; however, the cellular origin of these cells remains unclear. Here, we utilize Zfp423(GFP) reporter mice to characterize adipose mural (Pdgfrß(+)) cells with varying levels of the preadipocyte commitment factor Zfp423. We find that adipose tissue contains distinct mural populations, with levels of Zfp423 distinguishing adipogenic from inflammatory-like mural cells. Using our “MuralChaser” lineage tracking system, we uncover adipose perivascular cells as developmental precursors of adipocytes formed in obesity, with adipogenesis and precursor abundance regulated in a depot-dependent manner. Interestingly, Pdgfrß(+) cells do not significantly contribute to the initial cold-induced recruitment of beige adipocytes in WAT; it is only after prolonged cold exposure that these cells differentiate into beige adipocytes. These results provide genetic evidence for a mural cell origin of white adipocytes in obesity and suggest that beige adipogenesis may originate from multiple sources.</p>

<p>There has been substantial effort directed toward the application of bone marrow and adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue. Recently, resident tissue-specific stem cells have been described in a variety of mesenchymal structures including ligament, tendon, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In the current study, we systematically characterize three novel anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-derived cell populations with the potential for ligament regeneration: ligament-forming fibroblasts (LFF: CD146(neg) , CD34(neg) CD44(pos) , CD31(neg) , CD45(neg) ), ligament perivascular cells (LPC: CD146(pos) CD34(neg) CD44(pos) , CD31(neg) , CD45(neg) ) and ligament interstitial cells (LIC: CD34(pos) CD146(neg) , CD44(pos) , CD31(neg) , CD45(neg) )-and describe their proliferative and differentiation potential, collagen gene expression and metabolism in both normoxic and hypoxic environments, and their trophic potential in vitro. All three groups of cells (LIC, LPC, and LFF) isolated from adult human ACL exhibited progenitor cell characteristics with regard to proliferation and differentiation potential in vitro. Culture in low oxygen tension enhanced the collagen I and III gene expression in LICs (by 2.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively) and LFFs (by 3- and 3.5-fold, respectively) and increased oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in LICs (by 4- and 3.5-fold, respectively), LFFs (by 5.5- and 3-fold, respectively), LPCs (by 10- and 4.5-fold, respectively) as compared to normal oxygen concentration. In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time the presence of three novel progenitor cell populations in the adult ACL that demonstrate robust proliferative and matrix synthetic capacity; these cells may play a role in local ligament regeneration, and consequently represent a potential cell source for ligament engineering applications. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) mediates buffering of vasoconstriction through activation of endothelium-derived factors. We hypothesized that the PVAT of Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl SS) rats has reduced ability to buffer vasoconstriction. Vascular reactivity experiments were performed on aortic rings with PVAT intact (+PVAT) or removed (-PVAT), and endothelium intact (+ENDO) or removed (-ENDO) from Dahl SS rats and control SS.13(BN) rats (Dahl SS rats that have had chromosome 13 completely replaced with that of the Brown Norway rat, rendering this strain insensitive to high-salt or high-fat diet-induced hypertension). Endothelial dysfunction, assessed by ACh-mediated vasorelaxation, was confirmed in aortic rings of Dahl SS rats. The +PVAT+ENDO aortic rings had indistinguishable phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction between genotypes. In both strains, removal of PVAT significantly enhanced vasoconstriction. Dahl SS rat -PVAT+ENDO aortic rings displayed exaggerated vasoconstriction to phenylephrine vs. SS.13(BN) rats, indicating that PVAT-mediated buffering of vasoconstriction was greater in Dahl SS rats. Removal of both the ENDO and PVAT restored vasoconstriction in both strains. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N(<U+03C9>)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), produced a similar effect as that seen with -ENDO. These data indicate that the function of the PVAT to activate endothelium-derived NOS is enhanced in Dahl SS compared with SS.13(BN) rats and, most likely, occurs through a pathway that is distinct from ACh-mediated activation of NOS. PVAT weight and total PVAT leptin levels were greater in Dahl SS rats. Leptin induced a significantly decreased vasoconstriction in -PVAT+ENDO aortic rings from Dahl SS rats, but not SS.13(BN) rats. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, PVAT in Dahl SS rats buffers vasoconstriction by activating endothelial NOS via mechanisms that may include the involvement of leptin. Thus, the PVAT serves a vasoprotective role in Dahl SS rats on normal-salt diet.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to investigate the contribution of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) to vascular dysfunction in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Obesity was induced in male C57BL/6J mice with a high-fat diet for 20 weeks, and vascular function was studied with myograph. In PVAT-free aortas isolated from obese mice, the endothelium-dependent, nitric oxide-mediated vasodilator response to acetylcholine remained normal. In contrast, a clear reduction in the vasodilator response to acetylcholine was observed in aortas from obese mice when PVAT was left in place. Adipocytes in PVAT were clearly positive in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) staining, and PVAT nitric oxide production was significantly reduced in obese mice. High-fat diet had no effect on eNOS expression but led to eNOS uncoupling, evidenced by diminished superoxide production in PVAT after eNOS inhibition. As mechanisms for eNOS uncoupling, arginase induction and l-arginine deficiency were observed in PVAT. Obesity-induced vascular dysfunction could be reversed by ex vivo l-arginine treatment and arginase inhibition.CONCLUSIONS: Diet-induced obesity leads to l-arginine deficiency and eNOS uncoupling in PVAT. The combination therapy with l-arginine and arginase inhibitors may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity-induced vascular disease.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The Ossabaw pig is emerging as an attractive model of human cardiometabolic disease because of its size and susceptibility to atherosclerosis, among other characteristics. The relationship between adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in this model was investigated here.METHODS: Young female Ossabaw pigs were fed a Western-style high-fat diet (HFD) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4) or control low-fat diet (LFD) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>4) for a period of 9 months and compared for cardiometabolic outcomes and adipose tissue inflammation.RESULTS: The HFD-fed “OBESE” pigs were 2.5 times heavier (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) than LFD-fed “LEAN” pigs and developed severe obesity. HFD feeding caused pronounced dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance (systemic and adipose), as well as induction of inflammatory genes, impairments in vasomotor reactivity to insulin, and atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. Remarkably, visceral, subcutaneous, and perivascular adipose tissue inflammation (via FACS analysis and RT-PCR) was not increased in OBESE pigs, nor were circulating inflammatory cytokines.CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a disconnect between adipose tissue inflammation and cardiometabolic dysfunction induced by Western diet feeding in the Ossabaw pig model.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: CVD risk increases in women after menopause. Recent data suggest higher levels of complement protein C3 and cardiovascular fat (CF) in postmenopausal women. Whether complement proteins are associated with early markers of atherosclerosis in healthy midlife women has never been evaluated. Additionally, the potential impact of the local CF on these associations has never been assessed.METHODS: Participants (n = 100, age (mean(SD)):50.48(2.63), 50% premenopausal) were from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Arterial calcification (aortic-AC and coronary-CAC) and CF volumes around the heart and aorta (total heart-TAT and aortic perivascular adipose tissue-PVAT) were quantified using EBCT scans. AC and CAC were each evaluated as presence (Agatston scores &gt;0) and extent of calcification (log (Agatston scores+1)). Logistic and linear regression models were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Adjusting for age, race, menopausal status and lipids, C3 was significantly associated with both presence and extent of AC and CAC, all P values &lt;0.05. Associations between C3 and presence and extent of AC and CAC were explained by additional adjustment for log TAT and log PVAT, respectively. Association between C3 and log(AC+1) was more pronounced at higher volumes of log TAT (interaction-P = 0.013) adjusting for study variables. No associations were found with C4.CONCLUSIONS: Higher C3 was significantly associated with presence and greater extent of arterial calcification in midlife women. These associations were explained by higher volumes of CF, suggesting CF as a potential source of C3. C3 could be a potential non-invasive biomarker of early diagnosis of atherosclerosis. These findings need to be replicated in larger studies.</p>

<p>Perilipin-1 (Plin1) coats lipid droplets exclusively in adipocytes and regulates two principle functions of adipose tissue, triglyceride storage and hydrolysis, which are disrupted upon Plin1 deficiency. In the present study, we investigated the alterations in systemic metabolites and hormones, vascular function and adipose function in spontaneous hypertensive mice lacking perilipin-1 (Plin1-/-). Plin1-/- mice developed spontaneous hypertension without obvious alterations in systemic metabolites and hormones. Plin1 expressed only in adipose cells but not in vascular cells, so its ablation would have no direct effect in situ on blood vessels. Instead, Plin1-/- mice showed dysfunctions of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), a fat depot that anatomically surrounds systemic arteries and has an anticontractile effect. In Plin1-/- mice, aortic and mesenteric PVAT were reduced in mass and adipocyte derived relaxing factor secretion, but increased in basal lipolysis, angiotensin II secretion, macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress. Such multiple culprits impaired the anticontractile effect of PVAT to promote vasoconstriction of aortic and mesenteric arteries of Plin1-/- mice. Furthermore, arterial vessels of Plin1-/- mice showed increasing angiotensin II receptor type 1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and interlukin-6 expression, structural damage of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, along with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Hypertension in Plin1-/- mice might occur as a deleterious consequence of PVAT dysfunction. This finding provides the direct evidence that links dysfunctional PVAT to vascular dysfunction and hypertension, particularly in pathophysiological states. This hypertensive mouse model might mimic and explain the hypertension occurring in patients with adipose tissue dysfunction, particularly with Plin1 mutations.</p>

<p>ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Leaves of Phyllanthus acidus (PA) have been used in Thai traditional medicine for the treatment of hypertension. We have previously shown that chronic treatment of a PA water extract to middle-aged male rats caused a lowering of the body and serum lipids, two of the parameters that are implicated in cardiovascular disease.AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate if chronic treatment of middle-aged male rats with a PA water extract affected the perivascular (aortic) adipose tissue (PVAT) and/or their vascular functionsMATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh leaves of PA were extracted with water and orally gavaged to the middle-aged male rats for 6 weeks. Vascular functions were studied in vitro using isolated thoracic aorta with and without PVAT, and mesenteric rings in Krebs Heinseleit solution with results recorded with a Polygraph or a Myograph system. The amount of blood vessel eNOS and CSE (cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase) expression was measured by Western blotting.RESULTS: PA treatment caused a lower maximal contractile response to phenylephrine (Phe) of the endothelium-intact aortic ring than that of the control group. This effect was abolished by N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA) or by denudation of the endothelium. dl-propargylglycine (PAG, H2S inhibitor) and TEA (Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker), but not glybenclamide (ATP-activated K(+) channel blocker), caused a similar increase in the baseline of the endothelium-intact aortic ring in the presence of l-NA in both the PA-treated and control aortic rings. This effect sequentially resulted in a greater contractile response of the aortic rings of both groups to Phe. Glybenclamide also caused a similar increase in the maximal contraction of the endothelium-intact blood vessels with l-NA to both groups. PAG, TEA or glybenclamide did not modify the phenylephrine C-R curves for either group of the PVAT-endothelium-intact aortic rings preincubated with l-NA. The CSE levels of the thoracic aorta and at the PVAT were not different between the PA-treated and the control group. Relaxation of the Phe-precontracted thoracic aortic ring to acetylcholine, but not to glyceryl trinitrate, was higher for the PA-treated than for the control aortic rings and this effect was abolished by l-NA. The mesenteric rings of the PA treated group showed a lower sensitivity on the contractile response to Phe than that of the control group, and this effect was abolished by l-NA. Vasodilatation to acetylcholine, but not to glyceryl trinitrate, of the PA treated-mesenteric ring was more sensitive than that of the control group and this effect was abolished by l-NA. The expression of eNOS by the PA treated thoracic aorta and the mesenteric arteries was higher than the control group. These results demonstrated that chronic treatment with a PA water extract to middle-aged rats affected their vascular functions by increasing the nitric oxide production from the endothelial cells and also modulated the responsiveness of the thoracic aortic- and mesenteric rings to phenylephrine and acetylcholine.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) reduces vasoconstriction to norepinephrine (NE). A mechanism by which PVAT could function to reduce vascular contraction is by decreasing the amount of NE to which the vessel is exposed. PVATs from male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to test the hypothesis that PVAT has a NE uptake mechanism. NE was detected by HPLC in mesenteric PVAT and isolated adipocytes. Uptake of NE (10 µM) in mesenteric PVAT was reduced by the NE transporter (NET) inhibitor nisoxetine (1 µM, 73.68 ± 7.62%, all values reported as percentages of vehicle), the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (SERT) inhibitor citalopram (100 nM) with the organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) inhibitor corticosterone (100 µM, 56.18 ± 5.21%), and the NET inhibitor desipramine (10 µM) with corticosterone (100 µM, 61.18 ± 6.82%). Aortic PVAT NE uptake was reduced by corticosterone (100 µM, 53.01 ± 10.96%). Confocal imaging of mesenteric PVAT stained with 4-[4-(dimethylamino)-styrl]-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+)), a fluorescent substrate of cationic transporters, detected ASP(+) uptake into adipocytes. ASP(+) (2 µM) uptake was reduced by citalopram (100 nM, 66.68 ± 6.43%), corticosterone (100 µM, 43.49 ± 10.17%), nisoxetine (100 nM, 84.12 ± 4.24%), citalopram with corticosterone (100 nM and 100 µM, respectively, 35.75 ± 4.21%), and desipramine with corticosterone (10 and 100 µM, respectively, 50.47 ± 5.78%). NET protein was not detected in mesenteric PVAT adipocytes. Expression of Slc22a3 (OCT3 gene) mRNA and protein in PVAT adipocytes was detected by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively. These end points support the presence of a transporter-mediated NE uptake system within PVAT with a potential mediator being OCT3.</p>

<p>Obesity is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases. It is characterized by excessive or abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue, including depots which surround the blood vessels named perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). PVAT plays endocrine and paracrine roles by producing large numbers of metabolically vasoactive adipokines. The present review outlines our current understanding of the beneficial roles of PVAT in vascular tone and remodeling in healthy subjects supported by clinical studies, highlighting different factors or mechanisms that could mediate protective effects of PVAT on vascular function. Most studies in humans show that adiponectin is the best candidate for the advantageous effect of PVAT. However, in pathological conditions especially obesity-related cardiovascular diseases, the beneficial effects of PVAT on vascular functions are impaired and transform into detrimental roles. This change is defined as PVAT dysfunction. In the current review, the contribution of PVAT dysfunction to obesity-related cardiovascular diseases has been discussed with a focus on possible mechanisms including an imbalance between beneficial and detrimental adipokines (commonly described as decreased levels of adiponectin and increased levels of leptin or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa)), increased quantity of adipose tissue, inflammation, cell proliferation and endothelial dysfunction. Finally, novel pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders are addressed.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) is insufficient and limited. Our aim was to evaluate the association between a novel ultrasound index of periarterial fat and adventitia (carotid extra-media thickness; EMT) and the severity of CAD and to compare this with well-known vascular indexes in patients with high and very high CV risk.METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred twenty two patients scheduled for elective coronary angiography were included in the study (age: 61.3 ± 7.4 years; males 65%). Several clinical parameters of obesity were obtained as well as the following ultrasound indexes: carotid EMT and intima-media thickness (IMT), epicardial and pericardial fat thickness (EFT and PFT), and intra-abdominal fat thickness (IAT). These were then related to CAD severity in all individuals. Our study patients had a very high estimated CV risk (82%), and most (60%) fulfilled the MS criteria. Most individuals (71%) had CAD (=50% stenosis) with equal rates of one, two, or three-vessel disease, and critical (=70%) coronary stenosis was found in 40% of patients. Carotid EMT was significantly increased in patients with CAD (812 ± 116 vs 746 ± 131 µm) and patients with critical coronary stenosis (829 ± 119 vs 769 ± 122 µm) compared to the appropriate control groups. Moreover, carotid EMT was significantly associated with the severity of CAD. Carotid IMT and EFT (but not PFT and IAT) also revealed significant relations to the number of diseased vessels. Carotid EMT and the new proposed combined index (PATIMA = EMT/BMIx35 + IMT + EFTx60) were predictive for CAD (AUC: 686 ± 304 and 755 ± 260, sensitivity: 60 and 62%, specificity: 76 and 81% for 772 µm and 2015u).CONCLUSIONS: We present the first study showing that the new vascular index (carotid EMT) and the proposed combined index PATIMA are associated with the presence and the severity of CAD.</p>

<p>A microenvironment low in O2 (‘physiological’ hypoxia) governs the functions of perivascular multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, defining their involvement in tissue physiological homeostasis and regenerative remodelling. Acute hypoxic stress is considered as one of the important factors inducing tissue damage. Here, we evaluate the influence of short-term hypoxia (1% O2 for 24 h) on perivascular adipose tissue-derived cells (ASCs) permanently expanded in tissue-related O2 (5%) microenvironment. After hypoxic exposure, ASCs retained high viability, stromal cell morphology and mesenchymal phenotype (CD73+, CD90+, CD105+ and CD45-). Mild oxidative damage was unveiled as elevation of reactive oxygen species and thiobarbituric acid-active products, while no reduction in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase and a 20% statistically significant increase in superoxide dismutase activity was detected. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a and HIF-3a isoforms was differently regulated. HIF-1a displayed transient up-regulation, with maximum levels 30 min after acute hypoxic exposure, while HIF-3a was significantly up-regulated after 24 h. Up-regulation of ERK7, MEK1 and c-fos, and down-regulation of MKK6, p53, CCNA2, CCNB1 and CCNB2 were observed after 24 h of oxygen deprivation. Acute hypoxic exposure did not affect the gene expression of other mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and MAPK kinases, MAPK/ERK kinase-interacting proteins, MAPK-activated transcription factors and scaffolding proteins. Significant stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor a and interleukin-6 production was detected in ASC-conditioned medium. Thus, tissue O2-adapted ASCs are resistant to hypoxic stress, which can ensure their effective involvement in the regeneration of tissue damage under significant oxygen deprivation.</p>

<p>Interactions between perivascular tissue (PVT) and the vascular wall modify artery tone and contribute to local blood flow regulation. Using isometric myography, fluorescence microscopy, membrane potential recordings and phosphospecific immunoblotting, we investigated the cellular mechanisms by which PVT affects constriction and relaxation of rat coronary septal arteries. PVT inhibited vasoconstriction to thromboxane, serotonin and a1 -adrenergic stimulation but not to depolarization with elevated extracellular [K(+) ]. When PVT was wrapped around isolated arteries or placed at the bottom of the myograph chamber, a smaller yet significant inhibition of vasoconstriction was observed. Resting membrane potential, depolarization to serotonin or thromboxane stimulation, and resting and serotonin-stimulated vascular smooth muscle [Ca(2+) ]-levels were unaffected by PVT. Serotonin-induced vasoconstriction was almost abolished by rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and modestly reduced by protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide X. PVT reduced phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT) at Thr850 by ~40% in serotonin-stimulated arteries but had no effect on MYPT-phosphorylation in arteries depolarized with elevated extracellular [K(+) ]. The net anti-contractile effect of PVT was accentuated after endothelial denudation. PVT also impaired vasorelaxation and endothelial Ca(2+) responses to cholinergic stimulation. Methacholine-induced vasorelaxation was mediated by NO and H2 S, and particularly the H2 S-dependent (dl-propargylglycine- and XE991-sensitive) component was attenuated by PVT. Vasorelaxation to NO- and H2 S-donors was maintained in arteries with PVT. In conclusion, cardiomyocyte-rich PVT surrounding coronary arteries releases diffusible factors that reduce rho-kinase-dependent smooth muscle Ca(2+) sensitivity and endothelial Ca(2+) responses. These mechanisms inhibit agonist-induced vasoconstriction and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and suggest new signalling pathways for metabolic regulation of blood flow.</p>

<p>Sorting of native (unpermeabilized) SVF-cells from human subcutaneous (s)WAT for cell surface staining (cs) of DLK1 and CD34 identified three main populations: ~10% stained cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34-, ~20% cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34+dim and ~45% cs-DLK1-/cs-CD34+. FACS analysis after permeabilization showed that all these cells stained positive for intracellular DLK1, while CD34 was undetectable in cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34- cells. Permeabilized cs-DLK1-/cs-CD34+ cells were positive for the pericyte marker a-SMA and the mesenchymal markers CD90 and CD105, albeit CD105 staining was dim (cs-DLK1-/cs-CD34+/CD90+/CD105+dim/a-SMA+/CD45-/CD31-). Only these cells showed proliferative and adipogenic capacity. Cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34- and cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34+dim cells were also a-SMA+ but expressed CD31, had a mixed hematopoietic and mesenchymal phenotype, and could neither proliferate nor differentiate into adipocytes. Histological analysis of sWAT detected DLK1+/CD34+ and DLK1+/CD90+ cells mainly in the outer ring of vessel-associated stroma and at capillaries. DLK1+/a-SMA+ cells were localized in the CD34- perivascular ring and in adventitial vascular stroma. All these DLK1+ cells possess a spindle-shaped morphology with extremely long processes. DLK1+/CD34+ cells were also detected in vessel endothelium. Additionally, we show that sWAT contains significantly more DLK1+ cells than visceral (v)WAT. We conclude that sWAT has more DKL1+ cells than vWAT and contains different DLK1/CD34 populations, and only cs-DLK1-/cs-CD34+/CD90+/CD105+dim/a-SMA+/CD45-/CD31- cells in the adventitial vascular stroma exhibit proliferative and adipogenic capacity.</p>

<p>Progression of many cancers is associated with tumor infiltration by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Adipose stromal cells (ASC) are MSC that serve as adipocyte progenitors and endothelium-supporting cells in white adipose tissue (WAT). Clinical and animal model studies indicate that ASC mobilized from WAT are recruited by tumors. Direct evidence for ASC function in tumor microenvironment has been lacking due to unavailability of approaches to specifically inactivate these cells. Here, we investigate the effects of a proteolysis-resistant targeted hunter-killer peptide D-WAT composed of a cyclic domain CSWKYWFGEC homing to ASC and of a proapoptotic domain KLAKLAK2. Using mouse bone marrow transplantation models, we show that D-WAT treatment specifically depletes tumor stromal and perivascular cells without directly killing malignant cells or tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. In several mouse carcinoma models, targeted ASC cytoablation reduced tumor vascularity and cell proliferation resulting in hemorrhaging, necrosis, and suppressed tumor growth. We also validated a D-WAT derivative with a proapoptotic domain KFAKFAK2 that was found to have an improved cytoablative activity. Our results for the first time demonstrate that ASC, recruited as a component of tumor microenvironment, support cancer progression. We propose that drugs targeting ASC can be developed as a combination therapy complementing conventional cancer treatments.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been recognized as an active contributor to vascular function due to its paracrine effects on cells contained within vascular wall. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of diosgenin on adipokine expression in PVAT with emphasis on the regulation of endothelial function. Palmitic acid (PA) stimulation induced inflammation and dysregulation of adipokine expression in PVAT. Diosgenin treatment inhibited IKKß phosphorylation and downregulated mRNA expressions of proinflammatory cytokines/proteins including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), while reduced gene expressions for adiponectin, PPAR<U+03B3>, and arginase 1 (Arg-1) were reversed by diosgenin treatment. Diosgenin enhanced AMPK phosphorylation under basal and inflammatory conditions in PVAT, whereas knockdown of AMPK by SiRNA diminished its modulatory effect, indicating that diosgenin inhibited inflammation in an AMPK-dependent manner. We prepared conditioned medium from PA-stimulated PVAT to induce endothelial dysfunction and found that pre-treatment of PVAT with diosgenin effectively restored the loss of ACh-induced vasodilation and increased eNOS phosphorylation in rat aorta. High-fat diet feeding in rats induced inflammation in PVAT and the impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas these alterations were prevented by oral administration of diosgenin at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg. In conclusion, the obtained data showed that diosgenin ameliorated inflammation-associated adipokine dysregulation, and thereby prevented endothelial dysfunction. Our findings would shed a novel insight into the potential mechanism by which diosgenin protected endothelial function against inflammatory insult.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neovascularization is a prominent feature in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques. This review surveys recent evidence for and remaining uncertainties regarding a role of neovascularization in atherosclerotic plaque progression. Specific emphasis is given to hypoxia, angiogenesis inhibition, and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT).RECENT FINDINGS: Immunohistochemical and imaging studies showed a strong association between hypoxia, inflammation and neovascularization, and the progression of the atherosclerotic plaque both in humans and mice. Whereas in humans, a profound invasion of microvessels from the adventitia into the plaque occurs, neovascularization in mice is found mainly (peri)adventitially. Influencing neovascularization in mice affected plaque progression, possibly by improving vessel perfusion, but supportive clinical data are not available. Whereas plaque neovascularization contributes to monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the plaque, lymphangiogenesis may facilitate egress of cells and waste products. A specific role for PVAT and its secreted factors is anticipated and wait further clinical evaluation.SUMMARY: Hypoxia, inflammation, and plaque neovascularization are associated with plaque progression as underpinned by recent imaging data in humans.

<p>AIMS: Human epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a visceral and perivascular fat that has been shown to act locally on myocardium, atria, and coronary arteries. Its abundance has been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation. However, its physiological function remains highly debated. The aim of this study was to determine a specific EAT transcriptomic signature, depending on its anatomical peri-atrial (PA), peri-ventricular (PV), or peri-coronary location.METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of EAT and thoracic subcutaneous fat, obtained from 41 patients paired for cardiovascular risk factors, CAD, and atrial fibrillation were analysed using a pangenomic approach. We found 2728 significantly up-regulated genes in the EAT vs. subcutaneous fat with 400 genes being common between PA, PV, and peri-coronary EAT. These common genes were related to extracellular matrix remodelling, inflammation, infection, and thrombosis pathways. Omentin (ITLN1) was the most up-regulated gene and secreted adipokine in EAT (fold-change &gt;12, P &lt; 0.0001). Among EAT-enriched genes, we observed different patterns depending on adipose tissue location. A beige expression phenotype was found in EAT but PV EAT highly expressed uncoupled protein 1 (P = 0.01). Genes overexpressed in peri-coronary EAT were implicated in proliferation, O-N glycan biosynthesis, and sphingolipid metabolism. PA EAT displayed an atypical pattern with genes implicated in cardiac muscle contraction and intracellular calcium signalling pathway.CONCLUSION: This study opens new perspectives in understanding the physiology of human EAT and its local interaction with neighbouring structures.</p>

<p>Perivascular cells are multilineage cells located around the vessel wall and important for wall stabilization. In this study, we evaluated a stem cell media and a perivascular cell-specific media for the culture of primary perivascular cells regarding their cell morphology, doubling time, stem cell properties, and expression of cell type-specific markers. When the two cell culture media were compared to each other, perivascular cells cultured in the stem cell medium had a more elongated morphology and a faster doubling rate and cells cultured in the pericyte medium had a more typical morphology, with several filopodia, and a slower doubling rate. To evaluate stem cell properties, perivascular cells, CD146(-) cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were differentiated into the adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. It was seen that perivascular cells, as well as CD146(-) cells and MSCs, cultured in stem cell medium showed greater differentiation than cells cultured in pericyte-specific medium. The expression of pericyte-specific markers CD146, neural/glial antigen 2 (NG2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-ß (PDGFR-ß), myosin, and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) could be found in both pericyte cultures, as well as to varying amounts in CD146(-) cells, MSCs, and endothelial cells. The here presented work shows that perivascular cells can adapt to their in vitro environment and cell culture conditions influence cell functionality, such as doubling rate or differentiation behavior. Pericyte-specific markers were shown to be expressed also from cells other than perivascular cells. We can further conclude that CD146(+) perivascular cells are inhomogeneous cell population probably containing stem cell subpopulations, which are located perivascular around capillaries.</p>

<p>CONTEXT: Cardiovascular risk increases in women after menopause. Mounting evidence demonstrates a role of cardiovascular fat (CF) in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease, but no research has examined CF in relation to sex hormones or menopausal status in women.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the relationship between CF depots, menopausal status, and endogenous sex hormones.DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs were used.SETTING: The setting included the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Heart and Cardiovascular Fat Ancillary Study.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 456 women (mean age, 50.75 y); 62% premenopausal/early perimenopausal, and 38% late peri-/postmenopausal.INTERVENTION: Menopausal status, endogenous sex hormones measured simultaneously with CF volumes, and circulating estradiol available 4.80 years (median) before CF measures.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Volumes of CF (epicardial adipose tissue [EAT], paracardial adipose tissue [PAT], total heart adipose tissue [TAT = EAT + PAT], and aortic perivascular adipose tissue [PVAT]).RESULTS: In final models, late peri-/postmenopausal women had 9.88% more EAT, 20.72% more PAT, and 11.69% more TAT volumes than pre-/early perimenopausal women (P &lt; .05). PVAT was not associated with menopausal status. In final models, lower estradiol concentrations were associated with greater volumes of PAT and TAT (P &lt; .05). Women with the greatest reduction in estradiol since baseline had greater volumes of PAT compared to women with the least reduction (P = .02).CONCLUSIONS: Late peri-/postmenopausal women have greater volumes of heart fat compared with pre-/early perimenopausal women independent of age, obesity, and other covariates. Endogenous sex hormones are associated with CF. Perhaps CF plays a role in the higher risk of coronary heart disease reported in women after menopause.</p>

<p>Autologous bone grafts (ABGs) are considered as the gold standard for spinal fusion. However, osteoporotic patients are poor candidates for ABGs due to limited osteogenic stem cell numbers and function of the bone microenvironment. There is a need for stem cell-based spinal fusion of proven efficacy under either osteoporotic or nonosteoporotic conditions. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of human perivascular stem cells (hPSCs), a population of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from adipose tissue, in the presence and absence of NELL-1, an osteogenic protein, for spinal fusion in the osteoporosis. Osteogenic differentiation of hPSCs with and without NELL-1 was tested in vitro. The results indicated that NELL-1 significantly increased the osteogenic potential of hPSCs in both osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic donors. Next, spinal fusion was performed by implanting scaffolds with regular or high doses of hPSCs, with or without NELL-1 in ovariectomized rats (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>41). Regular doses of hPSCs or NELL-1 achieved the fusion rates of only 20%-37.5% by manual palpation. These regular doses had previously been shown to be effective in nonosteoporotic rat spinal fusion. Remarkably, the high dose of hPSCs+NELL-1 significantly improved the fusion rates among osteoporotic rats up to approximately 83.3%. Microcomputed tomography imaging and quantification further confirmed solid bony fusion with high dose hPSCs+NELL-1. Finally, histologically, direct in situ involvement of hPSCs in ossification was shown using undecalcified samples. To conclude, hPSCs combined with NELL-1 synergistically enhances spinal fusion in osteoporotic rats and has great potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoporotic patients.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis is chronic inflammatory process triggered by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can increase hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level, which induce atherosclerosis through the processes such as formation of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), foam cells, and atherosclerotic plaque. Antioxidant is needed to control negative effects of oxidative stress. One source of antioxidant, which has potential to be developed, is PsP from Ganoderma lucidum. This study aims to prove the effect of PsP in decreasing H2O2, PVAT, foam cells and atherosclerotic plaque.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was experimental randomized post-test with control group design using 25 Rattus norvegicus Wistar strain rats. Rats were divided into 5 groups (negative control, positive control, and 3 high-fat diet group with PsP dose: 50, 150, 300 mg/kgBW). Measured parameters were H2O2, PVAT, foam cell, and atherosclerotic plaques. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analysis, followed by post hoc test.RESULTS: Mean H2O2 levels, PVAT thickness, foam cell numbers, and atherosclerotic plaque were low in negative control group. ANOVA showed that PsP significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced H2O2 levels, PVAT thickness, foam cells numbers and atherosclerotic plaque width.CONCLUSION: PsP dose of 300 mg/kgBW has the most significant effect in decreasing H2O2 levels, PVAT thickness, number of foam cells, and atherosclerotic plaque width. Based on the results of this research, PsP can be recommended as antioxidant to control pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and induces vasorelaxation. We examined whether the sulfur-containing AMP and GMP analogs AMPS and GMPS can serve as the H2S donors in PVAT. H2S production by isolated rat periaortic adipose tissue (PAT) was measured with a polarographic sensor. In addition, phenylephrine-induced contractility of aortic rings with (+) or without (-) PAT was examined. Isolated PAT produced H2S from AMPS or GMPS in the presence of the P2X7 receptor agonist BzATP. Phenylephrine-induced contractility of PAT(+) rings was lower than of PAT(-) rings. AMPS or GMPS had no effect on the contractility of PAT(-) rings, but used together with BzATP reduced the contractility of PAT(+) rings when endogenous H2S production was inhibited with propargylglycine. A high-fat diet reduced endogenous H2S production by PAT. Interestingly, AMPS and GMPS were converted to H2S by PAT of obese rats, and reduced contractility of PAT(+) aortic rings isolated from these animals even in the absence of BzATP. We conclude that (i) AMPS and GMPS can be hydrolyzed to H2S by PAT when P2X7 receptors are activated, (ii) a high-fat diet impairs endogenous H2S production by PAT, (iii) AMPS and GMPS restore the anticontractile effects of PAT in obese animals without P2X7 stimulation.</p>

<p>The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) contains the essential protein RICTOR and is activated by growth factors. mTORC2 in adipose tissue contributes to the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. In the perivascular adipose tissue, mTORC2 ensures normal vascular reactivity by controlling expression of inflammatory molecules. To assess whether RICTOR/mTORC2 contributes to blood pressure regulation, we applied a radiotelemetry approach in control and Rictor knockout (Rictor(aP2KO)) mice generated using adipocyte protein-2 gene promoter-driven CRE recombinase expression to delete Rictor. The 24-hour mean arterial pressure was increased in Rictor(aP2KO) mice, and the physiological decline in mean arterial pressure during the dark period was impaired. In parallel, heart rate and locomotor activity were elevated during the dark period with a pattern similar to blood pressure changes. This phenotype was associated with mild cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, decreased cardiac natriuretic peptides, and their receptor expression in adipocytes. Moreover, clock gene expression was reduced or phase-shifted in perivascular adipose tissue. No differences in clock gene expression were observed in the master clock suprachiasmatic nucleus, although Rictor gene expression was also lower in brain of Rictor(aP2KO) mice. Thus, this study highlights the importance of RICTOR/mTORC2 for interactions between vasculature, adipocytes, and brain to tune physiological outcomes, such as blood pressure and locomotor activity.</p>

<p>The precise localization and biological characteristics of the adipose progenitor cells are still a focus of debate. In this study, the localization of the adipose progenitor cells was determined using an organotypic culture system of adipose tissue slices. The tissue slices of subcutaneous white adipose tissue from rats were placed on a porous membrane and cultured at the interface between air and the culture medium for up to 5 days with or without adipogenic stimulation. The structure of adipose tissue components was sufficiently preserved during the culture and, following adipogenic stimulation with insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, numerous multilocular adipocytes appeared in the interstitium among the mature adipocytes. Histomorphological 3-D observation using confocal laser microscopy revealed the presence of small mesenchymal cells containing little or no fat residing in the perivascular region and on the mature adipocytes and differentiation from the pre-existing mesenchymal cells to multilocular adipocytes. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that these cells were initially present within the fibronectin-positive extracellular matrix (ECM). The adipose differentiation of the mesenchymal cells was confirmed by the enhanced expression of C/EBP-ß suggesting adipose differentiation and the concurrent advent of CD105-expressing mesenchymal cells within the interstitium of the mature adipocytes. Based on the above, the mesenchymal cells embedded in the ECM around the mature adipocytes were confirmed to be responsible for adipogenesis because the transition of the mesenchymal cells to the stem state contributed to the increase in the number of adipocytes in rat adipose tissue.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Perivascular tissue (PVT) surrounding human internal thoracic artery (ITA) releases an unidentified anticontractile factor. The exact source of perivascular tissue-derived relaxing factor (PVRF) is unknown, although the adventitia and adipose tissue have both been suggested as primary candidates, hence the name adventitia or adipocyte-derived relaxing factor (ADRF). To look for the source of ADRF, we examined the dilatory response of human ITA to PVT aliquots in their histological composition.METHODS: We studied isolated ITA segments from 20 patients subjected to coronary artery surgery. The vessels were skeletonized in vitro. ITA rings and PVT were incubated in separate isolated organ baths. The arterial rings were suspended on stainless steel wire hooks in the organ bath chamber. Vessel wall tension was measured with an isometric force transducer. Skeletonized ITA segments were precontracted with 10(-5.5) M phenylephrine. The 5 ml PVT aliquots were next transferred to the ITA tissue bath, resulting in its relaxation. Subsequently, the whole PVT used during experiment was fixed in paraformaldehyde and subjected to histological examination. Tissue was paraffin-embedded, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The paraffin blocks containing PVT were cut into slices every 800 µm to create three-dimensional model. Every PVT specimen was evaluated morphometrically using the Image Pro Plus software to assess the content of three basic kinds of tissues. The ITA relaxation to PVT aliquots was correlated to the histological composition of the PVT.RESULTS: Phenylephrine elicited a 37.82 mN (Q1 = 26.49; Q3 = 46.31) contraction of the ITA. The addition of PVT aliquots to the skeletonized ITA induced a 54.17% (Q1 = 16.73; Q3 = 68.21) relaxation. The median PVT weight was 786 mg (Q1 = 562; Q3 = 976). The PVT composition was as follows: 30.5% (Q1 = 18.5; Q3 = 55.2) adipose tissue, 53.5 (Q1 = 24.6; Q3 = 66.5) muscular tissue and 13.5% (Q1 = 9.9; Q3 = 20.0) connective tissue. This translated into 197.7 mg of adipose tissue (Q1 = 142.2; Q3 = 393.2), 378.9 mg (Q1 = 178.8; Q3 = 537.0) of muscular tissue and 92.4 mg (Q1 = 68.6; Q3 = 185.8) of connective tissue. Neither PVT mass (r = 0.2, P = 0.92) nor adipose tissue (r = -0.2, P = 0.34), muscular tissue (r = 0.3, P = 0.18) or connective tissue (r = -0.2, P = 0.41) content correlated with ITA relaxation response to PVT aliquots.CONCLUSIONS: Adipose tissue from the pedicled ITA graft is an unlikely source of ADRF.</p>

<p>Pericytes are periendothelial cells of the microcirculation which contribute to tissue homeostasis and hemostasis by regulating microvascular morphogenesis and stability. Because of their multipotential ex vivo differentiation capabilities, pericytes are becoming very interesting in regenerative medicine field. Several studies address this issue by attempting to isolate pericyte/mesenchymal-like cells from peripheral blood; however the origin of these cells and their culture conditions are still debated. Here we showed that early Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) expressing CD45+/CD146+/CD31+ can be a source of cells with pericyte/mesenchymal phenotype and function, identified as human Progenitor Perivascular Cells (hPPCs). We provided evidence that hPPCs have an immunophenotype consistent with Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) from human adipose tissue (hASCs) and fetal membranes of term placenta (FM-hMSCs). In addition, hPPCs can be subcultured and exhibit expression of pluripotent genes (OCT-4, KLF-4, and NANOG) as well as a remarkable vasculogenic potential. Our findings could be helpful to develop innovative cell-based therapies for future clinical applications with distinct therapeutic purposes.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Adiponectin (APN) secreted from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is one of the important anti-inflammatory adipokines to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis, but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. In this study, we aimed to elucidate how APN regulates plaque formation in atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the role of APN secreted by PVAT in atherosclerosis progression, we performed PVAT transplantation experiments on carotid artery atherosclerosis model: ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice with a perivascular collar placement around the left carotid artery in combination with a high-fat diet feeding. Our results show that the ApoE-/- mice with PVAT derived from APN knockout (APN-/-) mice exhibited accelerated plaque volume formation compared to ApoE-/- mice transplanted with wild-type littermate tissue. Conversely, autophagy in macrophages was significantly attenuated in ApoE-/- mice transplanted with APN-/- mouse-derived PVAT compared to controls. Furthermore, in vitro studies indicate that APN treatment increased autophagy in primary macrophages, as evidenced by increased LC3-I processing and Beclin1 expression, which was accompanied by down-regulation of p62. Moreover, our results demonstrate that APN promotes macrophage autophagy via suppressing the Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PVAT-secreted APN suppresses plaque formation by inducing macrophage autophagy.</p>

<p>Fibrosis is a common disease process in which profibrotic cells disturb organ function by secreting disorganized extracellular matrix (ECM). Adipose tissue fibrosis occurs during obesity and is associated with metabolic dysfunction, but how profibrotic cells originate is still being elucidated. Here, we use a developmental model to investigate perivascular cells in white adipose tissue (WAT) and their potential to cause organ fibrosis. We show that a Nestin-Cre transgene targets perivascular cells (adventitial cells and pericyte-like cells) in WAT, and Nestin-GFP specifically labels pericyte-like cells. Activation of PDGFRa signaling in perivascular cells causes them to transition into ECM-synthesizing profibrotic cells. Before this transition occurs, PDGFRa signaling up-regulates mTOR signaling and ribosome biogenesis pathways and perturbs the expression of a network of epigenetically imprinted genes that have been implicated in cell growth and tissue homeostasis. Isolated Nestin-GFP(+) cells differentiate into adipocytes ex vivo and form WAT when transplanted into recipient mice. However, PDGFRa signaling opposes adipogenesis and generates profibrotic cells instead, which leads to fibrotic WAT in transplant experiments. These results identify perivascular cells as fibro/adipogenic progenitors in WAT and show that PDGFRa targets progenitor cell plasticity as a profibrotic mechanism.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases several important vasoactive factors with physiological and pathophysiological paracrine effects. A large body of evidence suggests regional phenotypic and functional differences among PVAT depots, depending on the specific vascular bed or different regions in the vascular bed where the PVAT is located. These non-uniform and separate PVATs exert various paracrine effects on vascular structure and function that largely impact disease states, such as endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, or insulin resistance. This emerging view of PVAT function requires considering heterogeneous PVAT as a specialized organ that can differentially regulate vascular function depending on its anatomical location. In this context, the adipose-vascular axis may represent a novel target for pharmacological intervention in vasculopathy in cardiometabolic disorders.</p>

<p>There are nineteen different receptor proteins for adenosine, adenine and uridine nucleotides, and nucleotide sugars, belonging to three families of G protein-coupled adenosine and P2Y receptors, and ionotropic P2X receptors. The majority are functionally expressed in blood vessels, as purinergic receptors in perivascular nerves, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and roles in regulation of vascular contractility, immune function and growth have been identified. The endogenous ligands for purine receptors, ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP and adenosine, can be released from different cell types within the vasculature, as well as from circulating blood cells, including erythrocytes and platelets. Many purine receptors can be activated by two or more of the endogenous ligands. Further complexity arises because of interconversion between ligands, notably adenosine formation from the metabolism of ATP, leading to complex integrated responses through activation of different subtypes of purine receptors. The enzymes responsible for this conversion, ectonucleotidases, are present on the surface of smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and may be coreleased with neurotransmitters from nerves. What selectivity there is for the actions of purines/pyrimidines comes from differential expression of their receptors within the vasculature. P2X1 receptors mediate the vasocontractile actions of ATP released as a neurotransmitter with noradrenaline (NA) from sympathetic perivascular nerves, and are located on the vascular smooth muscle adjacent to the nerve varicosities, the sites of neurotransmitter release. The relative contribution of ATP and NA as functional cotransmitters varies with species, type and size of blood vessel, neuronal firing pattern, the tone/pressure of the blood vessel, and in ageing and disease. ATP is also a neurotransmitter in non-adrenergic non-cholinergic perivascular nerves and mediates vasorelaxation via smooth muscle P2Y-like receptors. ATP and adenosine can act as neuromodulators, with the most robust evidence being for prejunctional inhibition of neurotransmission via A1 adenosine receptors, but also prejunctional excitation and inhibition of neurotransmission via P2X and P2Y receptors, respectively. P2Y2, P2Y4 and P2Y6 receptors expressed on the vascular smooth muscle are coupled to vasocontraction, and may have a role in pathophysiological conditions, when purines are released from damaged cells, or when there is damage to the protective barrier that is the endothelium. Adenosine is released during hypoxia to increase blood flow via vasodilator A2A and A2B receptors expressed on the endothelium and smooth muscle. ATP is released from endothelial cells during hypoxia and shear stress and can act at P2Y and P2X4 receptors expressed on the endothelium to increase local blood flow. Activation of endothelial purine receptors leads to the release of nitric oxide, hyperpolarising factors and prostacyclin, which inhibits platelet aggregation and thus ensures patent blood flow. Vascular purine receptors also regulate endothelial and smooth muscle growth, and inflammation, and thus are involved in the underlying processes of a number of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS: Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, partly through reduced insulin-induced microvascular vasodilation, which causes impairment of glucose delivery and uptake. We studied whether perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) controls insulin-induced vasodilation in human muscle, and whether altered properties of PVAT relate to reduced insulin-induced vasodilation in obesity.METHODS: Insulin-induced microvascular recruitment was measured using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU), before and during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp in 15 lean and 18 obese healthy women (18-55 years). Surgical skeletal muscle biopsies were taken on a separate day to study perivascular adipocyte size in histological slices, as well as to study ex vivo insulin-induced vasoreactivity in microvessels in the absence and presence of PVAT in the pressure myograph. Statistical mediation of the relation between BMI and microvascular recruitment by PVAT was studied in a mediation model.RESULTS: Obese women showed impaired insulin-induced microvascular recruitment and lower metabolic insulin sensitivity compared with lean women. Microvascular recruitment was a mediator in the association between obesity and insulin sensitivity. Perivascular adipocyte size, determined in skeletal muscle biopsies, was larger in obese than in lean women, and statistically explained the difference in microvascular recruitment between obese and lean women. PVAT from lean women enhanced insulin-induced vasodilation in isolated skeletal muscle resistance arteries, while PVAT from obese women revealed insulin-induced vasoconstriction.INTERPRETATION: PVAT from lean women enhances insulin-induced vasodilation and microvascular recruitment whereas PVAT from obese women does not. PVAT adipocyte size partly explains the difference in insulin-induced microvascular recruitment between lean and obese women.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent symptoms stand as a major determinant of stroke risk in patients with carotid stenosis, likely reflective of atherosclerotic plaque destabilization. In view of emerging links between vascular and adipose biology, we hypothesized that human perivascular adipose characteristics associate with carotid disease symptom status.METHODS: Clinical history, carotid plaques, blood, and subcutaneous and perivascular adipose tissues were prospectively collected from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Nine adipose-associated biological mediators were assayed and compared in patients with symptomatic (n=15) versus asymptomatic (n=19) disease. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple testing (a/9=0.006).RESULTS: Symptomatic patients had 1.9-fold higher perivascular adiponectin levels (P=0.005). Other circulating, subcutaneous, and perivascular biomarkers, as well as microscopic plaque characteristics, did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid endarterectomy patients display a tissue-specific difference in perivascular adipose adiponectin. This difference, which was not seen in plasma or subcutaneous compartments, supports a potential local paracrine relationship with vascular disease processes that may be related to stroke mechanisms.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at evaluating the effects of a cafeteria diet (obesity) mouse model on early multi-organ functional, structural, endocrine and biochemical alterations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-organ damage is assessed using clinical, biochemical, pathological, and inflammatory parameters in 30 mice fed one of the three diets for 15 weeks: standard chow diet (SC), high fat (HF), or “Cafeteria diet” (CAF) (standard SC and a choice of highly palatable human cafeteria foods: chocolate, biscuits, and peanut butter).RESULTS: CAF diet was associated with an increase in body weight, energy intake, and serum cholesterol levels compared to the other diets, as well as higher insulin levels and lower glucose tolerance. Additionally, consumption of the CAF diet was associated with significantly higher weight gain, abdominal fat, and serum IL-6 levels, as well as more damage in the heart (coronary perivascular fibrosis and steatosis), kidney (chronic interstitial inflammation and glomerular sclerosis), and liver (liver weight, portal fibrosis, apoptosis, and steatosis) compared to the HF diet.CONCLUSION: Functional and structural damage in CAF were higher than HF of similar macronutrient composition. This study provides a novel dietary model in mice that mimics multi-organ physiologic alterations in humans secondary to obesity.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The complement component C1q triggers activation of the classical immune pathway and can bind to adiponectin (APN). Recently, some studies have been reported that serum C1q-APN/total APN ratio correlates with atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). We assessed the relationships between C1q related variables and the severity of CAD, and investigated the localization of the C1q-APN complex.METHODS: The sample included 153 subjects comprising healthy controls and patients with subclinical or overt CAD. We measured the serum concentrations of C1q, total APN, and high-molecular weight (HMW)-APN, and the amount of C1q-APN complex. We identified the sites of C1q-APN complex deposition in various adipose tissues and blood vessels.RESULTS: Serum concentrations of C1q and HMW-APN and the C1q/HMW-APN ratio were independently associated with the severity of coronary stenosis. The amount of C1q-APN complex was significantly higher in patients with CAD compared with controls. C1q and APN co-localized in perivascular areas of subcutaneous, visceral, and pericardial fat tissues, and the internal mammary artery of patients with severe CAD.CONCLUSIONS: Serum C1q concentration and the C1q/HMW-APN ratio were independent markers of coronary artery stenosis. The amount of C1q-APN complex was significantly greater in serum from CAD patients. C1q and APN co-localized to perivascular areas in adipose tissue and blood vessels. The association between the increased amount of the C1q-APN complex and CAD should be investigated further.</p>

<p>Lastra, Manrique</p>
<p>Obesity is a leading risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), however the underlying mechanisms still remain to be fully uncovered. It is now well accepted that dysfunctional adipose tissue in conditions of obesity is a critical source of inflammation that impacts the cardiovascular system and contributes to CVD. Although traditionally visceral adipose tissue has been linked to increased CVD risk, there is mounting interest in the role that fat accumulation around the vasculature plays in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is in intimate contact with large, medium and small diameter arterial beds in several tissues, and has been shown to control vascular function as well as remodeling. PVAT does not merely mirror visceral adipose tissue changes seen in obesity, but has unique features that impact vascular biology. In lean individuals PVAT exerts vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory functions, however obesity results in PVAT inflammation, characterized by imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cells as wells as adipokines. PVAT inflammation promotes insulin resistance in the vasculature, thus resulting in impaired insulin-mediated vasodilatory responses and vascular remodeling. In this review we address current knowledge about the mechanisms that link PVAT inflammation to insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction. Indeed, PVAT emerges as a novel type of adipose tissue that participates in the pathogenesis of CVD, independently to a large extent to visceral adipose tissue.</p>

<p>AIMS: In patients with obesity, there is increased inflammation with attendant oxidative stress in perivascular adipose tissue. This has functional consequences with loss of vasodilator adipokine bioavailability. Part of the inflammatory response is mediated by increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can improve the anticontractile function of perivascular adipose tissue.METHODS: Segments of rat mesenteric small artery were dissected and mounted in a wire myograph and contracted to incremental doses of norepinephrine in the presence and absence of perivascular adipose tissue and in conditions of normal oxygenation or after hypoxia and incubated with captopril or telmisartan.RESULTS: Vessels with perivascular adipose tissue contracted significantly less than arteries with perivascular adipose tissue removed under normal oxygenation conditions, indicating that perivascular adipose tissue exerts an anticontractile effect. Hypoxia induced a loss of this anticontractile effect which could be completely prevented with captopril or telmisartan.CONCLUSION: The in-vitro creation of a hypoxic environment can simulate the loss of anticontractile perivascular adipose tissue function seen in vivo in obese patients, and this can be prevented using inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin cascade.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: We set out to investigate the cause of persistently increased signal intensity (SI) in the posterior portion of the proximal patellar tendon (pPT) on T1-weighted images (T1WI).METHODS: MR imaging was performed in eight cadavers, followed by gross histological examination. In addition, 84 patients without trauma history or anterior knee pain were included to compare the SI of the PTs. The patients were divided according to their age, sex, and Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades. The length and thickness of the increased SI portion in the pPT and whole PT (wPT) on T1WI were recorded.RESULTS: Histological specimens demonstrated that the adipose tissue, vessels, and perivascular connective tissue invaginated into the posterior portion of the pPT. This histological anatomy corresponded to the pPT signal change on MR imaging. There was linear and interdigitating increased SI of the pPT in all of the 84 patients (100%). There were no differences in the lengths and thicknesses of the increased SI portion of pPTs and wPTs according to age, sex, and KL grade (all p<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The increased SI of the pPT on T1WI and fluid-sensitive MR images results from invaginating fat, vessels, and perivascular connective tissue. It is not pathological, but a normal and common finding.KEY POINTS: • Increased linear/interdigitated SIs of the pPT is a normal and common finding. • Invaginated adipose tissue, vessels, and connective tissue could contribute to increased SI. • The fibrocartilage has a minimal role in increased SI of the pPT. • Age, sex, and KL grade do not significantly influence the increased SI. • Knowledge of this increased SI should help clinicians to avoid unnecessary treatment.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (<U+03C9>3 PUFAs) suppress inflammation through activation of free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), but this pathway has not been explored in the context of cardiovascular disease. We aimed to elucidate the involvement of FFAR4 activation by <U+03C9>3 PUFAs in the process of vascular inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia in mice.METHODS AND RESULTS: We used mice with disruption of FFAR4 (Ffar4(-/-)), along with a strain that synthesizes high levels of <U+03C9>3 PUFAs (fat-1) and a group of crossed mice (Ffar4(-/-)/fat-1), to elucidate the role of FFAR4 in vascular dysfunction using acute and chronic thrombosis/vascular remodeling models. The presence of FFAR4 in vascular-associated cells including perivascular adipocytes and macrophages, but not platelets, was demonstrated. <U+03C9>3 PUFAs endogenously generated in fat-1 mice (n=9), but not in compound Ffar4(-/-)/fat-1 mice (n=9), attenuated femoral arterial thrombosis induced by FeCl3. Neointimal hyperplasia and vascular inflammation in the common carotid artery were significantly curtailed 4 weeks after FeCl3 injury in fat-1 mice (n=6). This included greater luminal diameter and enhanced blood flow, reduced intima:media ratio, and diminished macrophage infiltration in the vasculature and perivascular adipose tissue compared with control mice. These effects were attenuated in the Ffar4(-/-)/fat-1 mice.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that <U+03C9>3 PUFAs mitigate vascular inflammation, arterial thrombus formation, and neointimal hyperplasia by interaction with FFAR4 in mice. Moreover, the <U+03C9>3 PUFA-FFAR4 pathway decreases inflammatory responses with dampened macrophage transmigration and infiltration.</p>

<p>We tested the hypothesis that aortic perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) from young low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLr(-/-)) mice promotes aortic stiffness and remodeling, which would be mediated by greater PVAT-derived IL-6 secretion. Arterial stiffness was assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity and with ex vivo intrinsic mechanical properties testing in young (4-6 mo old) wild-type (WT) and LDLr(-/-) chow-fed mice. Compared with WT mice, LDLr(-/-) mice had increased aortic pulse wave velocity (407 ± 18 vs. 353 ± 13 cm/s) and intrinsic mechanical stiffness (5,308 ± 623 vs. 3,355 ± 330 kPa) that was associated with greater aortic protein expression of collagen type I and advanced glycation end products (all P &lt; 0.05 vs. WT mice). Aortic segments from LDLr(-/-) compared with WT mice cultured in the presence of PVAT had greater intrinsic mechanical stiffness (6,092 ± 480 vs. 3,710 ± 316 kPa), and this was reversed in LDLr(-/-) mouse arteries cultured without PVAT (3,473 ± 577 kPa, both P &lt; 0.05). Collagen type I and advanced glycation end products were increased in LDLr(-/-) mouse arteries cultured with PVAT (P &lt; 0.05 vs. WT mouse arteries), which was attenuated when arteries were cultured in the absence of PVAT (P &lt; 0.05). PVAT from LDLr(-/-) mice secreted larger amounts of IL-6 (3.4 ± 0.1 vs. 2.3 ± 0.7 ng/ml, P &lt; 0.05), and IL-6 neutralizing antibody decreased intrinsic mechanical stiffness in LDLr(-/-) aortic segments cultured with PVAT (P &lt; 0.05). Collectively, these data provide evidence for a role of PVAT-derived IL-6 in the pathogenesis of aortic stiffness and remodeling in chow-fed LDLr(-/-) mice.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The effects of coronary perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on vasomotor tone are influenced by an obese phenotype and are distinct from other adipose tissue depots. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of lean and obese coronary PVAT on end-effector mechanisms of coronary vasodilation and to identify potential factors involved.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed similarities in coronary perivascular adipocyte size between lean and obese Ossabaw swine. Isometric tension studies of isolated coronary arteries from Ossabaw swine revealed that factors derived from lean and obese coronary PVAT attenuated vasodilation to adenosine. Lean coronary PVAT inhibited K(Ca) and KV7, but not KATP channel-mediated dilation in lean arteries. In the absence of PVAT, vasodilation to K(Ca) and KV7 channel activation was impaired in obese arteries relative to lean arteries. Obese PVAT had no effect on K(Ca) or KV7 channel-mediated dilation in obese arteries. In contrast, obese PVAT inhibited KATP channel-mediated dilation in both lean and obese arteries. The differential effects of obese versus lean PVAT were not associated with changes in either coronary KV7 or K(ATP) channel expression. Incubation with calpastatin attenuated coronary vasodilation to adenosine in lean but not in obese arteries.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that lean and obese coronary PVAT attenuates vasodilation via inhibitory effects on vascular smooth muscle K(+) channels and that alterations in specific factors such as calpastatin are capable of contributing to the initiation or progression of smooth muscle dysfunction in obesity.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases several adipo(cyto)kines. Some are vasoactive substances that elicit a net beneficial anticontractile effect. Resveratrol and testosterone are known to modulate adipo(cyto)kine release from adipose tissue and could therefore influence the anticontractile effect of PVAT. In vitro tension measurements were performed using thoracic aorta segments with and without adipose tissue from sham-operated or orchidectomized male Swiss mice. Concentration-response curves to norepinephrine (NOR) were constructed in the presence and absence of resveratrol (10 µM, 15 min) or the relaxant effect of resveratrol (10-100 µM) was investigated after inducing tone with NOR (5 µM). Aortas with PVAT displayed significantly attenuated contractions to NOR compared with aortas without PVAT. In aortas without PVAT, resveratrol (10 µM) significantly decreased NOR responses and elicited concentration-dependent (10-100 µM) relaxations. However, in aortas with adherent PVAT, resveratrol (10 µM) neither decreased NOR responses, nor did resveratrol (10-100 µM) induce arterial relaxations. The anticontractile effect of PVAT was less pronounced in the presence of resveratrol and unaltered by orchidectomy. Orchidectomy did not influence contractions induced by NOR. Orchidectomy does not modulate the anticontractile capacity of PVAT, while resveratrol decreases the vasorelaxing influence of PVAT. The positive effects associated with resveratrol addition are neutralized by the presence of PVAT. This is thought to result from a dual effect of resveratrol: (1) inhibition of the influence of vasodilatory adipo(cyto)kines and (2) a direct relaxant effect on the vascular smooth muscle. Overall, the beneficial relaxing effect of resveratrol is lost in mice thoracic aorta surrounded by PVAT.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue engineering offers a promising alternative to the current breast reconstruction options. Here we investigated patient-specific breast scaffolds fabricated from poly(d,l)-lactide polymer with pore sizes&gt;1 mm for their potential in long-term sustained regeneration of high volume adipose tissue. An optimised scaffold geometry was modelled in silico via a laser scanning data set from a patient who underwent breast reconstruction surgery. After the design process scaffolds were fabricated using an additive manufacturing technology termed fused deposition modelling. Breast-shaped scaffolds were seeded with human umbilical cord perivascular cells and cultured under static conditions for 4 weeks and subsequently 2 weeks in a biaxial rotating bioreactor. These in vitro engineered constructs were then seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and implanted subcutaneously into athymic nude rats for 24 weeks. Angiogenesis and adipose tissue formation were observed throughout all constructs at all timepoints. The percentage of adipose tissue compared to overall tissue area increased from 37.17% to 62.30% between week 5 and week 15 (p&lt;0.01), and increased to 81.2% at week 24 (p&lt;0.01), while the seeded endothelial cells self-organised to form a functional capillary network. The presented approach of fabricating customised scaffolds using 3D scans represents a facile approach towards engineering clinically relevant volumes of adipose tissue for breast reconstruction.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is a recognized endocrine organ that acts not only as a fuel storage but also is able to secrete adipokines that can modulate inflammation. Most of the fat is composed of white adipocytes (WAT), although also brown/beige adipocytes (BAT/BeAT) have been found in humans. BAT is located close to the neck but also among WAT in the epicardial fat and perivascular fat. Adipocyte hypertrophy and infiltration of macrophages impair adipose tissue metabolism determining “adiposopathy” (i.e., sick fat) and increasing the risk to develop metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this review was to search and discuss the available literature on the impact of different types of fat and fat distribution on cardiometabolic risk. Visceral fat, but also ectopic fat, either in liver, muscle and heart, can increase the risk to develop insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Results recently published showed that BAT could have an impact on cardiometabolic risk, not only because it is implicated in energy metabolism but also because it can modulate glucose and lipid metabolism. Therapeutical interventions that can increase energy expenditure, successfully change fat distribution and reduce ectopic fat, also through BAT activation, were discussed.</p>

<p>The presence of proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages (CD14+CD16+) has been documented in conditions of inflammation, such as atherosclerosis. We analysed the proportion of proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages in perirenal and perivascular fat in healthy living kidney donors with regard to sex and age reflecting reproductive status in women; therefore, women were further divided to younger and older group (younger and older than 51 years) reflecting potential age of menopause. Monocyte/macrophages were identified as CD14+ mononuclear cells and divided into subpopulations based on the co-expression of CD16. We found no differences in the monocyte/macrophage content between men (n = 15) and women (n = 28). Conversely, we observed a higher proportion of double positive CD14+CD16+ monocytes/macrophages in older women (n = 14) compared to younger women (n = 14). In addition, a strong correlation was found between the monocyte/macrophage content in fat and age only in older women. Therefore, proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages (CD14+CD16+) should be evaluated according to the sex and age.</p>

<p>Inflammation plays a crucial role in the development and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary vessels. Adipose tissue is considered to act in paracrine manner, which modulates a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Perivascular adipose tissue has developed specific properties that distinguish it from the fat in other locations. Interestingly, its activity depends on several metabolic conditions associated with insulin resistance and weight gain. Particularly in obesity perivascular fat seems to change its character from a protective to a detrimental one. The present review analyzes literature in terms of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, with particular emphasis on inflammatory processes. Additionally, the authors summarize data about confirmed paracrine activity of visceral adipose tissue and especially about pericoronary fat influence on the vascular wall. The contribution of adiponectin, leptin and resistin is addressed. Experimental and clinical data supporting the thesis of outside-to-inside signaling in the pericoronary milieu are further outlined. Clinical implications of epicardial and pericoronary adipose tissue activity are also evaluated. The role of pericoronary adipose tissue in obesity-related atherosclerosis is highlighted. In conclusion, the authors discuss potential therapeutical implications of these novel phenomena, including adipokine imbalance in pericoronary adipose tissue in the setting of obesity, the influence of lifestyle and diet modification, pharmaceutical interventions and the growing role of microRNAs in adipogenesis, insulin resistance and obesity. Key teaching points: • adipose tissue as a source of inflammatory mediators • changes in the vascular wall as a result of outside-to-inside signaling • anatomy, physiology, and clinical implications of epicardial and pericoronary adipose tissue activity • adipokines and their role in obesity-related atherosclerosis • therapeutic perspectives and future directions.</p>

<p>Since the “rediscovery” of brown adipose tissue in adult humans, significant scientific efforts are being pursued to identify the molecular mechanisms to promote a phenotypic change of white adipocytes into brown-like cells, a process called “browning”. It is well documented that white adipose tissue (WAT) mass and factors released from WAT influence the vascular function and positively correlate with cardiac arrest, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications. Similar to other fat depots, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is an active endocrine organ and anatomically surrounds vessels. Both brown-like and white-like PVAT secrete various adipokines, cytokines, and growth factors that either prevent or promote the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) depending on the relative abundance of each type and their bioactivity in the neighboring vasculature. Notably, pathophysiological conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, or diabetes, induce the imbalance of PVAT-derived vasoactive products that promote the infiltration of inflammatory cells. This then triggers derangements in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cell dysfunction, resulting in the development of vascular diseases. In this review, we discuss the recent advances on the contribution of PVAT in CVDs. Specifically, we summarize the current proposed roles of PVAT in relationship with vascular contractility, endothelial dysfunction, neointimal formation, arterial stiffness, and aneurysm.</p>

<p>Potential markers and the mechanism of the spontaneous transformation of multipotent stromal cells (MSC) with perivascular immunophenotype have been determined. A transcriptome comparative study was performed involving six paired specimens of normal and spontaneously transformed MSC with perivascular immunophenotype, obtained in the first passages following the isolation of adipose tissue of six healthy donors. According to the results obtained using the microarray Illumina HT-12 v4 with the Significance Analysis of Microarrays software, differentially expressed transcripts were revealed and a statistical analysis using Gene Ontology and Molecular Signatures Databases was conducted. The association of the spontaneous transformation of isolated MSC with perivascular immunophenotype with previously identified oncogenic cell transformation pathways (E2F, ATR/ATM, RAS, and RHOA) is suggested and further aims for more detailed study are set. Potential transformation markers, including largely unknown genes and those previously not associated with cancer genes (HSPB6, PLAC9, FEZ1, DTWD1, APH1A, and ATP5L) are described.</p>

<p>Continued improvements in the understanding and application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have revolutionized tissue engineering. This is particularly true within the field of skeletal regenerative medicine. However, much remains unknown regarding the native origins of MSC, the relative advantages of different MSC populations for bone regeneration, and even the biologic safety of such unpurified, grossly characterized cells. This review will first summarize the initial discovery of MSC, as well as the current and future applications of MSC in bone tissue engineering. Next, the relative advantages and disadvantages of MSC isolated from distinct tissue origins are debated, including the MSC from adipose, bone marrow, and dental pulp, among others. The perivascular origin of MSC is next discussed. Finally, we briefly comment on pluripotent stem cell populations and their possible application in bone tissue engineering. While continually expanding, the field of MSC-based bone tissue engineering and regeneration shows potential to become a clinical reality in the not-so-distant future.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is an ‘endocrine organ’ that influences diverse physiological and pathological processes via adipokines secretion. Strong evidences suggest that epicardial and perivascular adipose tissue can directly regulate heart and vessels’ structure and function. Indeed, in obesity there is a shift toward the secretion of adipokines that promote a pro-inflammatory status and contribute to obesity cardiomyopathy. The prospect of modulating adipokines and/or their receptors represents an attractive perspective to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we described the most important actions of certain adipokines and their receptors that are capable of influencing cardiovascular physiology as well as their possible use as therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>Essential hypertension (EH) and its complications have had a severe impact on public health. However, the underlying mechanisms of the pathogenesis of EH remain largely unknown. Recent investigations, predominantly in rats and mice, have provided evidence that dysregulation of distinct functions of T lymphocyte subsets is a potentially important mechanism in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We critically reviewed recent findings and propose an alternative explanation on the understanding of dysfunctional T lymphocyte subsets in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The hypothesis is that hypertensive stimuli, directly and indirectly, increase local IL-6 levels in the cardiovascular system and kidney, which may promote peripheral imbalance in the differentiation and ratio of Th17 and T regulatory cells. This results in increased IL-17 and decreased IL-10 in perivascular adipose tissue and adventitia contributing to the development of hypertension in experimental animal models. Further investigation in the field is warranted to inform new translational advances that will promote to understand the pathogenesis of EH and develop novel approaches to prevent and treat EH.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the association between a novel ultrasound index extra-media thickness (EMT), obesity, and metabolic syndrome (MS) using several measures of adiposity.METHODS: Four hundred patients were included in the study (age: 60.95 ± 7.3 years, F/M: 35/65%). Both common carotid arteries (CCA) indexes (EMT and intima-media thickness), anthropometric parameters, body fat percentage and ultrasound measures of different fat depots were obtained in all patients. MS was identified using three alternative definitions: International Diabetes Federation 2005 (IDF), National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III 2001 (NCEP ATP III) and World Health Organization 1998 (WHO).RESULTS: The study group included patients with very high (80.2%) or high (19.8%) CV risk (IDF MS: 59.5%). Carotid EMT measures averaged from both sides (±SD) were as follows: mean EMT: 791 ± 126 µm, mean minimum EMT: 731 ± 115 µm and mean maximum EMT: 885 ± 210 µm. Patients with MS, irrespective of its definition and measures of obesity, displayed significantly thicker mean EMT compared to non-MS individuals: 819 ± 129 µm vs 747 ± 113 µm (p &lt; 0.001; IDF), 824 ± 131 µm vs 751 ± 112 µm (p &lt; 0.001; NCEP ATP III) and 825 ± 137 µm vs 773 ± 120 µm (p &lt; 0.001; WHO). Moreover, EMT was related to all major parameters of general obesity, abdominal fat distribution, regional neck subcutaneous fat with weaker association between EMT and epicardial fat thickness. Finally, EMT is associated with an increasing number of CV risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study providing novel findings on the relationship between EMT, MS, and adiposity indexes. Our results suggest that EMT may be a new non-invasive index of perivascular adipose tissue corresponding to cardiometabolic risk.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Maternal obesity elicits offspring’s metabolic disorders via developmental modifications of visceral adipose tissue; however, its effect on atherogenesis remains undefined. Perivascular adipose tissue has recently been implicated in vascular remodeling and vasoreactivity. We hypothesize that developmental modifications of perivascular adipose tissue by maternal high-fat diet (HFD) exposure promotes atherosclerosis in adult offspring.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Eight-week-old female apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were fed an HFD or normal diet (ND) during gestation and lactation. Offspring were fed a high-cholesterol diet from 8 weeks of age. Twenty-week-old male offspring of HFD-fed dams (O-HFD) showed a 2.1-fold increase in atherosclerotic lesion of the entire aorta compared with those of ND-fed dams (O-ND). Although mRNA expressions of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and accumulation of macrophages in epididymal white adipose tissue were less in O-HFD than in O-ND, thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (tPAT) showed an exaggerated inflammatory response in O-HFD. Intra-abdominal transplantation of tPAT from 8-week-old O-HFD alongside the distal abdominal aorta exaggerated atherosclerosis development of the infrarenal aorta in recipient apolipoprotein E-deficient mice compared with tPAT from O-ND (210%, P&lt;0.01). Although macrophage accumulation was rarely detected in tPAT of 8-week-old offspring, mRNA expression and protein levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor were markedly elevated in O-HFD (2.3-fold, 3.3-fold, respectively, P&lt;0.05), suggesting that increased macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression contributes to the augmented accumulation of macrophages, followed by the enhanced proinflammatory response.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that maternal HFD exaggerates atherosclerosis development in offspring by augmenting tPAT-specific inflammatory response proceeded by an increased expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: We have previously shown an increased expression of complement 3 (C3) in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive model. This study aims to examine the role and underlying mechanism of C3 in PVAT for understanding the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular remodeling further.APPROACH AND RESULTS: The role of C3 in macrophage polarization was investigated using peritoneal macrophages from wild-type and C3-deficient (C3KO) mice because we found that C3 was primarily expressed in macrophages in PVAT of blood vessels from DOCA-salt mice, and results showed a decreased expression of M1 phenotypic marker in contrast to an increased level of M2 marker in the C3KO macrophages. Bone marrow transplantation studies further showed in vivo that DOCA-salt recipient mice had fewer M1 but more M2 macrophages in PVAT when the donor bone marrows were from C3KO compared with those from wild-type mice. Of note, this macrophage polarization shift was accompanied with an ameliorated vascular injury. Furthermore, we identified the complement 5a (C5a) as the major C3 activation product that was involved in macrophage polarization and DOCA-salt-induced vascular injury. Consistently, in vivo depletion of macrophages prevented the induction of C3 and C5a in PVAT, and ameliorated hypertensive vascular injury as well.CONCLUSIONS: The presence and activation of bone marrow-derived macrophages in PVAT are crucial for complement activation in hypertensive vascular inflammation, and C5a plays a critical role in DOCA-salt-induced vascular injury by stimulating macrophage polarization toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype in PVAT.</p>

Here, we present data regarding clinical presentations, diagnoses, management, and prognosis of five cases of hepatic PEComa between January 2002 and December 2008. Ultrasonography showed hyperechoic masses in all patients. Precontrast computed tomography (CT) showed that all lesions scanned were heterogeneous in density and were heterogeneously enhanced in arterial phase images. In two cases, magnetic resonance imaging showed hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. In enhanced scanning, lesions showed asymmetrical enhancement during arterial phase imaging. All tumors were composed of varying proportions of smooth muscle, adipose tissue, and thick-walled blood vessels, and showed positive immunohistochemical staining for Human Melanoma Black-45.

<p>Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the vascular complications of type 2 diabetes. We examined the effect of type 2 diabetes on NADPH oxidase in human vessels and explored the mechanisms of this interaction. Segments of internal mammary arteries (IMAs) with their perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and thoracic adipose tissue were obtained from 386 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery (127 with type 2 diabetes). Type 2 diabetes was strongly correlated with hypoadiponectinemia and increased vascular NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide anions (O2<U+02D9>(-)). The genetic variability of the ADIPOQ gene and circulating adiponectin (but not interleukin-6) were independent predictors of NADPH oxidase-derived O2<U+02D9>(-). However, adiponectin expression in PVAT was positively correlated with vascular NADPH oxidase-derived O2<U+02D9>(-). Recombinant adiponectin directly inhibited NADPH oxidase in human arteries ex vivo by preventing the activation/membrane translocation of Rac1 and downregulating p22(phox) through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt-mediated mechanism. In ex vivo coincubation models of IMA/PVAT, the activation of arterial NADPH oxidase triggered a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3>-mediated upregulation of the adiponectin gene in the neighboring PVAT via the release of vascular oxidation products. We demonstrate for the first time in humans that reduced adiponectin levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes stimulates vascular NADPH oxidase, while PVAT “senses” the increased NADPH oxidase activity in the underlying vessel and responds by upregulating adiponectin gene expression. This PVAT-vessel interaction is identified as a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of vascular complications of type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes to vasoregulation. The role of this adipose tissue bed in pregnancy has not been examined. Here, we tested the hypothesis that PVAT in pregnant rats decreases resistance artery tone. Mesenteric arteries from nonpregnant (NP) and late pregnant (LP) rats were exposed to phenylephrine (PHE) or KCl in the presence (+) versus absence (-) of PVAT. The LP PVAT(+) vessels showed a 44% decrease in sensitivity to PHE in the presence of PVAT. There was no attenuation of the contractile response to KCl when PVAT was present. The LP arteries perfused with LP or NP PVAT underwent vasodilation; unexpectedly, NP vessels in the presence of PVAT from LP rats sustained a 48% vasoconstriction. The PVAT attenuates vasoconstriction by a mechanism that involves hyperpolarization. The vasoconstriction observed when nonpregnant vessels were exposed to pregnant PVAT suggests pregnant vessels adapt to the vasoconstricting influence of pregnant PVAT.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The parameters that characterize the intricate water diffusion in tumors may also reveal their distinct pathology. Specifically, characterization of breast cancer could be aided by diffusion magnetic resonance.The present in vitro study aimed to discover connections between the NMR biexponential diffusion parameters [fast diffusion phase (D(FDP)), slow diffusion phase (D(SDP)), and spin population of fast diffusion phase (P1)] and the histological constituents of nonmalignant (control) and malignant human breast tissue. It also investigates whether the diffusion coefficients indicate tissue status.METHODS: Post-surgical specimens of control (mastopathy and peritumoral tissues) and malignant human breast tissue were placed in an NMR spectrometer and diffusion sequences were applied. The resulting decay curves were analyzed by a biexponential model, and slow and fast diffusion parameters as well as percentage signal were identified. The same samples were also histologically examined and their percentage composition of several tissue constituents were measured: parenchyma (P), stroma (St), adipose tissue (AT), vessels (V) , pericellular edema (PCE), and perivascular edema (PVE). Correlations between the biexponential model parameters and tissue types were evaluated for different specimens. The effects of tissue composition on the biexponential model parameters, and the effects of histological and model parameters on cancer probability, were determined by non-linear regression.RESULTS: Meaningful relationships were found among the in vitro data. The dynamic parameters of water in breast tissue are stipulated by the histological constituents of the tissues (P, St, AT, PCE, and V). High coefficients of determination (R2) were obtained in the non-linear regression analysis: D(FDP) (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.92), D(SDP) (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.81), and P1(R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.93).In the cancer probability analysis, the informative value (R2) of the obtained equations of cancer probability in distinguishing tissue malignancy depended on the parameters input to the model. In order of increasing value, these equations were: cancer probability (P, St, AT, PCE, V) (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.66), cancer probability (D(FDP), D(SDP))(R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.69), cancer probability (D(FDP), D(SDP), P1) (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.85).CONCLUSION: Histological tissue components are related to the diffusion biexponential model parameters. From these parameters, the relative probability of cancer in a given specimen can be determined with some certainty.</p>

<p>Volume stability and growth of tissue engineered adipose tissue equivalents using adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) rely strongly on angiogenesis and neovascularization to support the maintenance of cells. An attractive cellular approach is based on coimplantation of endothelial cells to create a vascular network. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a promising cell population, since they can be easily isolated from autologous human peripheral blood and thus represent a clinically feasible option. We have previously shown in in vitro and semi-in vivo studies that ASCs exert beneficial effects on EPCs in terms of enhanced tube formation and formation of blood vessels, respectively. In this study, we investigated the in vivo effects of coimplantation on endothelial cell-mediated neovascularization and ASC-mediated adipose tissue formation. For this purpose, human ASCs and human EPCs (or HUVECs as direct comparison to EPCs) were suspended alone or in coculture in fibrin and subcutaneously injected into the back of athymic nude mice and explanted after 1, 3 or 6months. Our results show that monocultures of EPCs or HUVECs were not able to perform vasculogenesis and constructs exhibited complete resorption already after 1month. However, a remarkable difference between EPCs and HUVECs was detected when coimplanted with ASCs. While coimplanted HUVECs gave rise to a stable neovasculature which was characterized by perfusion with erythrocytes, coimplanted EPCs showed no ability to form vascular structures. In the case of HUVEC-derived neovasculature, coimplanted ASCs displayed perivascular properties by stabilizing these neovessels. However, formation of human adipose tissue was independent of coimplanted endothelial cells. Our results indicate that HUVECs are superior to EPCs in terms of promoting in vivo neovascularization and recruiting perivascular cells for vessel stabilization when coimplanted with ASCs.</p>

<p>RATIONALE: Vessel formation is a crucial event in tissue repair after injury. Thus, one assumption of innovative therapeutic approaches is the understanding of its molecular mechanisms. Notwithstanding our knowledge of the role of Protein Kinase C epsilon (PKCe) in cardio-protection and vascular restenosis, its role in vessel progenitor differentiation remains elusive.OBJECTIVE: Given the availability of PKCe pharmacological modulators already tested in clinical trials, the specific aim of this study is to unravel the role of PKCe in vessel progenitor differentiation, with implications in vascular pathology and vasculogenesis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Mouse Peri-Vascular Adipose Tissue (PVAT) was used as source of mesenchymal vessel progenitors. VEGF-induced differentiation of PVAT cells down-regulates both PKCe and p-PAK1 protein expression levels. PKCe overexpression and activation: i) reduced the expression levels of SMA and PECAM in endothelial differentiation of PVAT cells; ii) completely abrogated tubules formation in collagen gel assays; iii) increased the expression of p-PAK1.CONCLUSION: PKCe negatively interferes with vessel progenitor differentiation via interaction with PAK-1.</p>

<p>Crosstalk between adipose tissue and blood vessels is vital to vascular homeostasis and is disturbed in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) refers to the clustering of obesity-related metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, glucose and lipid profile alterations, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. Adipose tissue associated with the vasculature [known as perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)] has been shown to produce myriads of adipose tissue-derived substances called adipokines, including hormones, cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which actively participate in the regulation of vascular function and local inflammation by endocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms. As a result, the signaling from PVAT to the vasculature is emerging as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes-related vascular dysfunction. Accumulating evidence supports a shift in our understanding of the crucial role of elevated plasma levels of aldosterone in obesity, promoting insulin resistance and hypertension. In obesity, aldosterone/mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling induces an abnormal secretion of adipokines, ROS production and systemic inflammation, which in turn contribute to impaired insulin signaling, reduced endothelial-mediated vasorelaxation, and associated cardiovascular abnormalities. Thus, aldosterone excess exerts detrimental metabolic and vascular effects that participate to the development of the CMS and its associated cardiovascular abnormalities. In this review, we focus on the physiopathological roles of corticosteroid receptors in the interplay between PVAT and the vasculature, which underlies their potential as key regulators of vascular function.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Ethyl alcohol exerts both positive and negative effects on the cardiovascular system. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy, produced by direct or indirect mechanisms, is well-documented. An important, but seldom appreciated effect is an increase in iron deposition in the myocardium, which can add to the cardiac dysfunction. The present study was planned to document the pathological features and iron levels in the cardiac tissue of patients who were chronic alcoholics and correlate these characteristics with the liver pathology and iron content.MATERIALS AND METHODS: An autopsy-based prospective study of 40 consecutive patients compared with ten age matched controls (no history of alcohol intake). Histopathological changes like the morphology of the cardiac myocytes, degree of fibrosis (interstitial, interfiber, perivascular, and replacement), presence of inflammatory cells, increased capillary network, and adipose tissue deposition were noted and graded. These were also correlated with the liver pathology. The iron content in the heart and liver were measured by using calorimetry.RESULTS: All cases had increased epicardial adipose tissue with epicardial and endocardial fibrosis, prominence of interstitial and interfiber fibrosis, myofiber degeneration, and increased capillary network; this was particularly prominent in patients with cirrhosis. Elemental iron level in heart tissue was raised in the cases relative to controls.CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol produces subclinical changes in the myocardium, with an increased iron content, which may be the forerunner for subsequent clinical cardiac dysfunction.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other nicotine containing products is increasing among women of reproductive age. The short- and long-term effects of these products on both mother and fetus are unknown.METHODS: Because e-cigarettes are nicotine delivery systems, we sought to conduct a comprehensive review of the effects of nicotine on the fetus.RESULTS: In utero nicotine exposure in animal models is associated with adverse effects for the offspring lung, cardiovascular system and brain. In the lung, this included reduced surface area, weight, and volume, as well as emphysema-like lesions. In adulthood, exposed offspring demonstrate elevated blood pressure and increased perivascular adipose tissue. In the brain, exposure alters offspring serotonergic, dopaminergic, and norepinephrine networks, which in turn are associated with behavioral and cognitive impairments. We also review current data on the lack of efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnant women, and highlight different nicotine containing products such as snuff, snus, and hookah.CONCLUSION: We conclude that no amount of nicotine is known to be safe during pregnancy, and studies specifically addressing this risk are crucial and an imminent public health issue.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments are promising vascularisation units for applications in the field of tissue engineering. Elderly patients are the major future target population of such applications due to an increasing human life expectancy. Therefore, we herein investigated the effect of aging on the fragments’ vascularisation capacity. Microvascular fragments were isolated from epididymal fat pads of adult (8 months) and aged (16 months) C57BL/6 donor mice. These fragments were seeded onto porous polyurethane scaffolds, which were implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers to study their vascularisation using intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry. Scaffolds seeded with fragments from aged donors exhibited a significantly lower functional microvessel density and intravascular blood flow velocity. This was associated with an impaired vessel maturation, as indicated by vessel wall irregularities, constantly elevated diameters and a lower fraction of CD31/a-smooth muscle actin double positive microvessels in the implants’ border and centre zones. Additional in vitro analyses revealed that microvascular fragments from adult and aged donors do not differ in their stem cell content as well as in their release of angiogenic growth factors, survival and proliferative activity under hypoxic conditions. However, fragments from aged donors exhibit a significantly lower number of matrix metalloproteinase -9-positive perivascular cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aging is a crucial determinant for the vascularisation capacity of isolated microvascular fragments.</p>

<p>Obesity, and especially excessive visceral adipose tissue accumulation, is considered as a low-grade inflammatory state that is responsible for adipocyte dysfunction and associated metabolic disorders. Adipose tissue displays endocrine functions by releasing pro- or anti-inflammatory bioactive molecules named adipokines. An altered expression of these molecules, provoked by obesity or adipocyte dysregulation, contributes to major metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus that are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, obesity is also characterised by the expansion of perivascular adipose tissue that acts locally via diffusion of adipokines into the vascular wall. Local inflammation within blood vessels induced by adipokines contributes to the onset of endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and thrombosis, but also to vascular remodelling and hypertension. A fast expansion of obesity is expected in the near future, which will rapidly increase the incidence of these cardiovascular diseases. The focus of this review is to summarise the link between metabolic and cardiovascular disease and discuss current treatment approaches, limitations and future perspectives for more targeted therapies.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue is implicated in vasoreactivity; however, its effect on atherosclerosis remains undefined.METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the effect of a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) on phenotypic alterations of the thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (tPAT) in apoE-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice. Gene expression of the components of the renin angiotensin system and that of macrophage markers were significantly higher in apoE(-/-) mice fed an HCD than in those fed a chow diet (CD). These changes were absent both in angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker (ARB)-treated apoE(-/-) mice and in Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor-deficient apoE(-/-) (Agtr1(-/-)/apoE(-/-)) mice. To evaluate their effect on atherosclerosis, we transplanted tPAT into apoE(-/-) mice alongside the distal abdominal aorta. Transplanted tPAT was harvested from apoE(-/-) and Agtr1(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice fed a CD (tPAT-CD/apoE(-/-), tPAT-CD/Agtr1(-/-)/apoE(-/-)), HCD (tPAT-HCD/apoE(-/-), tPAT-HCD/Agtr1(-/-)/apoE(-/-)), or HCD in combination with ARB treatment (tPAT-HCD/ARB/apoE(-/-)). Four weeks after transplantation, a significantly increased oil red O-positive area was observed in the aorta of tPAT-HCD/apoE(-/-) mice than in tPAT-CD/apoE(-/-) mice. Such a change was absent in tPAT-HCD/ARB/apoE(-/-) and tPAT-HCD/Agtr1(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that AT1 receptor plays a crucial role in HCD-induced phenotypic alterations of tPAT, modulation of which could exert beneficial effects on atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipocyte (PVAC) biofunctions were closely related to cardiovascular diseases; its specific biological mechanisms remained unclear. How to adjust PVAC functions of vascular cells is an important topic. The present study was designed to investigate whether FAK/Pyk2 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways participate in PVAC functions, which is activated by insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) and inhibited by Gax. PVACs isolated from perivascular adipocyte were cultured, dedifferentiated, and stimulated with 10nM IGF-I. Cellular function experiments showed that IGF-1 promoted PVAC proliferation, adhesion, and migration. However Gax weakened IGF-1-mediated these function. Flow cytometry demonstrated that IGF-1 increased PVACs percent of S phase and decreased the percent of G0/G1 phase and apoptotic cells. While, Gax decreased the percent of S phase cells and increased those of G0-G1 phase and apoptotic cells. Western blotting and RT-PCR revealed that IGF-1 activated FAK/Pyk2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of FAK, Pyk2, and ERK1/2, and suppressed p53 expression. Reversely, Gax lowered the expression of these signaling proteins and increased p53 expression. Therefore, IGF-1 mediated FAK/Pyk2 and ERK1/2 pathways to augment PVAC functions; Gax effectively counteracted these effects of IGF-1, repressed PVAC activities, and increased the cell apoptosis. Our findings suggested that FAK/Pyk2 and ERK1/2 cooperative activation mediated by IGF-1 is essential for PVAC functions, and Gax is a promising candidate gene to interfere with these signaling pathways and inhibit PVAC functions.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is an attractive source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) because of its abundance and accessibility. We have previously defined a population of native MSCs termed perivascular stem cells (PSCs), purified from diverse human tissues, including adipose tissue. Human PSCs (hPSCs) are a bipartite cell population composed of pericytes (CD146+CD34-CD45-) and adventitial cells (CD146-CD34+CD45-), isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and with properties identical to those of culture identified MSCs. Our previous studies showed that hPSCs exhibit improved bone formation compared with a sample-matched unpurified population (termed stromal vascular fraction); however, it is not known whether hPSCs would be efficacious in a spinal fusion model. To investigate, we evaluated the osteogenic potential of freshly sorted hPSCs without culture expansion and differentiation in a rat model of posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion. We compared increasing dosages of implanted hPSCs to assess for dose-dependent efficacy. All hPSC treatment groups induced successful spinal fusion, assessed by manual palpation and microcomputed tomography. Computerized biomechanical simulation (finite element analysis) further demonstrated bone fusion with hPSC treatment. Histological analyses showed robust endochondral ossification in hPSC-treated samples. Finally, we confirmed that implanted hPSCs indeed differentiated into osteoblasts and osteocytes; however, the majority of the new bone formation was of host origin. These results suggest that implanted hPSCs positively regulate bone formation via direct and paracrine mechanisms. In summary, hPSCs are a readily available MSC population that effectively forms bone without requirements for culture or predifferentiation. Thus, hPSC-based products show promise for future efforts in clinical bone regeneration and repair.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a kind of disease with multiple risk factors, of which hyperlipidemia is a major classical risk factor resulting in its pathogenesis and development. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of short-term intensive atorvastatin (IA) therapy on vascular endothelial function and explore the possible mechanisms that may help to explain the clinical benefits from short-term intensive statin therapy.METHODS: After exposure to high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, the animals were, respectively, treated with IA or low-dose atorvastatin (LA) for 5 days. Blood lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation function were, respectively, measured. mRNA and protein expression of CRP, TNF-a, IL-6, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) were also evaluated in pericarotid adipose tissue (PCAT) and cultured adipocytes.RESULTS: HFD increased serum inflammatory factor levels; induced significant hyperlipidemia and endothelial dysfunction, including imbalance between NO and ET-1; enhanced inflammatory factors and 5-LO expression; and promoted macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. Five-day IA therapy could significantly decrease serum inflammatory factor levels and their expression in PCAT; restore the balance between NO and ET-1; and improve endothelial function and macrophage infiltration without significant changes in blood lipids. However, all of the above were not observed in LA therapy. In vitro experiment found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the expression of inflammatory factors and 5-LO in cultured adipocytes, which could be attenuated by short-time (6 hours) treatment of high-dose (5 µmol/L) but not low-dose (0.5 µmol/L) atorvastatin. In addition, inhibiting 5-LO by Cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-a-cyanocinnamate (CDC, a potent and direct 5-LO inhibitor) could significantly downregulate the above-mentioned gene expression in LPS-treated adipocytes.CONCLUSION: Short-term IA therapy could significantly ameliorate endothelial dysfunction induced by HFD, which may be partly due to attenuating inflammation of PCAT through inhibiting 5-LO pathway.</p>

<p>Adipose and endothelial dysfunction is tightly associated with cardiovascular diseases in obesity and insulin resistance. Because perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds vessels directly and influences vessel functions through paracrine effect, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) show similarities in modulation of metabolic pathway, we hypothesized that activation of AMPK and SIRT1 in PVAT might regulate the endothelial function in pathological settings. Thus, in this study, we focused on the regulation of AMPK and SIRT1 activities implicated in adipocytokine expression and endothelial homeostasis under inflammatory conditions by using salicylate, metformin, AICA riboside (AICAR) and resveratrol as AMPK activating agents. We prepared conditioned medium (CM) by stimulating PVAT with palmitic acid (PA) and observed the effects of AMPK activating agents on adipocytokine expression and vessel vasodilation in rats. Moreover, we explored the effects of resveratrol and metformin in fructose-fed rats. We observed that PA stimulation induced inflammation and dysregulation of adipocytokine expression accompanied with reduced AMPK activity and SIRT1 abundance in PVAT. AMPK activating agents inhibited NF-<U+03BA>B p65 phosphorylation and suppressed gene expression of pro-inflammatory adipocytokines, and upregulated adiponectin and PPAR<U+03B3> expression in PVAT in an AMPK/SIRT1-interdependent manner. Meanwhile, CM stimulation impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to acetylcholine (ACh). Pretreatment of CM with AMPK-activating agents enhanced eNOS phosphorylation in the aorta and restored the loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas this action was abolished by co-treatment with AMPK inhibitor compound C or SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide. Long-term fructose-feeding in rats induced dysregulation of adipocytokine expression in PVAT and the loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, whereas these alterations were reversed by oral administration of resveratrol and metformin. Altogether, pharmacological activation of AMPK beneficially regulated adipocytokine expression in PVAT and thus ameliorated endothelial dysfunction against inflammatory insult in an AMPK/SIRT1-interdependent manner.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) is often described as ‘protective’. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is often described as ‘pathologic’. However, both SAT and VAT have protective and pathologic potential, with interdependent biologic functions.RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the body’s (excess) energy is stored as fat in SAT. If during positive caloric balance, SAT does not undergo adequate adipogenesis, then excess energy may result in adipocyte hypertrophy, leading to hypoxia, immunopathies, and endocrinopathies. Energy overflow may promote accumulation of pericardial fat, perivascular fat, and myocardial fat, which may directly contribute to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lipotoxic free fatty acid delivery to nonadipose body organs (e.g. liver, muscle, and pancreas) may indirectly contribute to CVD by promoting the most common metabolic disorders encountered in clinical practice (e.g. high blood sugars, high blood pressure, and dyslipidaemia), all major CVD risk factors. Finally, SAT energy overflow may increase VAT accumulation, which is also associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases and CVD.SUMMARY: Increased VAT is a surrogate marker for SAT dysfunction which increases waist circumference, reflecting a shared pathologic process leading to the pathogenic fat accumulation of other fat depots and fatty infiltration of nonadipose body organs. Central obesity is a clinical marker for adiposopathy.</p>

<p>The average of overweight individual can have differential fat depots in target organs or specific compartments of the body. This ectopic fat distribution may be more of a predictive factor for cardiovascular risk than obesity. Abdominal visceral obesity, a representative ectopic fat, is robustly associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. Fat depots in the liver and muscle tissue cause adverse cardiometabolic risk by affecting glucose and lipid metabolism. Pericardial fat and perivascular fat affect coronary atherosclerosis, cardiac function, and hemodynamics. Fat around the neck is associated with systemic vascular resistance. Fat around the kidney may increase blood pressure and induce albuminuria. Fat accumulation in or around the pancreas alters glucose metabolism, conferring cardiovascular risk. Ectopic fat may act as an active endocrine and paracrine organ that releases various bioactive mediators that influence insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism, coagulation, and inflammation, which all contribute to cardiovascular risk. Because both obese and apparently lean individuals can have ectopic fat, regional fat distribution may play an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in both nonobese and obese people.</p>

<p>The present study investigates effects of surrounding tissues and non-uniform wall thickness on the biomechanics of the thoracic aorta. We construct two idealised computational models exemplifying the importance of surrounding tissues and non-uniform wall thickness, namely the uniform-thickness model and the histology image-based model. While the former neglects a connective tissue layer surrounding the aorta, the latter takes it into account with non-uniform wall thickness. Using plane strain finite element analysis, stress distributions in the aortic media between the two models are compared. The histology image-based model substantially enhances the uniformity of stress throughout the aortic media. Furthermore, the altered mechanical properties of surrounding tissues change the stress distribution. These results suggest that surrounding tissues and non-uniform wall thickness should be included in biomechanical analysis to better understand regional adaptation of the aortic wall during normal physiological conditions or pathological conditions such as aortic aneurysms and dissections.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue has been recognized unequivocally as a major player in the pathology of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Through its production of adipokines and the release of other thus far unidentified factors, this recently discovered adipose tissue modulates vascular regulation and the myogenic response. After the discovery of its ability to diminish the vessel’s response to vasoconstrictors, a new paradigm established adipose-derived relaxing factor (ADRF) as a paracrine smooth muscle cells’ potassium channel opener that could potentially help combat vascular dysfunction. This review will discuss the role of ADRF in vascular dysfunction in obesity and hypertension, the different potassium channels that can be activated by this factor, and describes new pharmacological tools that can mimic the ADRF effect and thus can be beneficial against vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Stem cells have huge applications in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Their use is currently not restricted to the life-threatening diseases but also extended to disorders involving the structural tissues, which may not jeopardize the patients’ life, but certainly influence their quality of life. In fact, a particularly popular line of research is represented by the regeneration of bone and cartilage tissues to treat various orthopaedic disorders. Most of these pioneering research lines that aim to create new treatments for diseases that currently have limited therapies are still in the bench of the researchers. However, in recent years, several clinical trials have been started with satisfactory and encouraging results. This article aims to review the concept of stem cells and their characterization in terms of site of residence, differentiation potential and therapeutic prospective. In fact, while only the bone marrow was initially considered as a “reservoir” of this cell population, later, adipose tissue and muscle tissue have provided a considerable amount of cells available for multiple differentiation. In reality, recently, the so-called “stem cell niche” was identified as the perivascular space, recognizing these cells as almost ubiquitous. In the field of bone and joint diseases, their potential to differentiate into multiple cell lines makes their application ideally immediate through three main modalities: (1) cells selected by withdrawal from bone marrow, subsequent culture in the laboratory, and ultimately transplant at the site of injury; (2) bone marrow aspirate, concentrated and directly implanted into the injury site; (3) systemic mobilization of stem cells and other bone marrow precursors by the use of growth factors. The use of this cell population in joint and bone disease will be addressed and discussed, analysing both the clinical outcomes but also the basic research background, which has justified their use for the treatment of bone, cartilage and meniscus tissues.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in obese individuals. Obesity dramatically increases the risk of development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. This risk appears to originate from disruption in adipose tissue function leading to a chronic inflammatory state and to dysregulation of the endocrine and paracrine actions of adipocyte-derived factors. These, in turn, impair vascular homeostasis and lead to endothelial dysfunction. An altered endothelial cell phenotype and endothelial dysfunction are common among all obesity-related complications. A crucial aspect of endothelial dysfunction is reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. A systemic pro-inflammatory state in combination with hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, oxidative stress and activation of the renin angiotensin system are systemic disturbances in obese individuals that contribute independently and synergistically to decreasing NO bioavailability. On the other hand, pro-inflammatory cytokines are locally produced by perivascular fat and act through a paracrine mechanism to independently contribute to endothelial dysfunction and smooth muscle cell dysfunction and to the pathogenesis of vascular disease in obese individuals. The promising discovery that obesity-induced vascular dysfunction is, at least in part, reversible, with weight loss strategies and drugs that promote vascular health, has not been sufficiently proved to prevent the cardiovascular complication of obesity on a large scale. In this review we discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying inflammation and vascular damage in obese patients.</p>

<p>Erdheim-Chester disease is a rarely reported disease that can affect nearly every organ and chiefly infiltrates the connective, perivascular, and adipose tissue. The disease is a form of non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis characterized by the proliferation of foamy histiocytes; its cardiovascular complications carry a severe prognosis. We present the case of a 29-year-old woman who was admitted for analysis of her angina. Our evaluation with use of cardiac multidetector computed tomographic angiography revealed large mediastinal soft tissue that compressed the patient’s left anterior descending coronary artery. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of low-dose, dual-source, 256-slice multidetector computed tomography to characterize Erdheim-Chester disease that exclusively caused angina and stenosis of a coronary artery in a young adult.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) expands during obesity, is highly inflamed, and correlates with coronary plaque burden and increased cardiovascular risk. We tested the hypothesis that PVAT contributes to the vascular response to wire injury and investigated the underlying mechanisms.APPROACH AND RESULTS: We transplanted thoracic aortic PVAT from donor mice fed a high-fat diet to the carotid arteries of recipient high-fat diet-fed low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice. Two weeks after transplantation, wire injury was performed, and animals were euthanized 2 weeks later. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify adventitial macrophage infiltration and neovascularization and neointimal lesion composition and size. Transplanted PVAT accelerated neointimal hyperplasia, adventitial macrophage infiltration, and adventitial angiogenesis. The majority of neointimal cells in PVAT-transplanted animals expressed a-smooth muscle actin, consistent with smooth muscle phenotype. Deletion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in PVAT substantially attenuated the effects of fat transplantation on neointimal hyperplasia and adventitial angiogenesis, but not adventitial macrophage infiltration. Conditioned medium from perivascular adipocytes induced potent monocyte chemotaxis in vitro and angiogenic responses in cultured endothelial cells.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that PVAT contributes to the vascular response to wire injury, in part through monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-dependent mechanisms.</p>

<p>Studies suggest T cells modulate arterial pressure. Because robust sex differences exist in the immune system and in hypertension, we investigated sex differences in T-cell modulation of angiotensin II-induced increases in mean arterial pressure in male (M) and female (F) wild-type and recombination-activating-gene-1-deficient (Rag1(-/-)) mice. Sex differences in peak mean arterial pressure in wild-type were lost in Rag1(-/-) mice (mm Hg: wild-type-F, 136±4.9 versus wild-type-M, 153±1.7; P&lt;0.02; Rag1(-/-)-F, 135±2.1 versus Rag1(-/-)-M, 141±3.8). Peak mean arterial pressure was 13 mm Hg higher after adoptive transfer of male (CD3(M)<U+2192>Rag1(-/-)-M) versus female (CD3(F)<U+2192>Rag1(-/-)-M) T cells. CD3(M)<U+2192>Rag1(-/-)-M mice exhibited higher splenic frequencies of proinflammatory interleukin-17A (2.4-fold) and tumor necrosis factor-a (2.2-fold)-producing T cells and lower plasma levels (13-fold) and renal mRNA expression (2.4-fold) of interleukin-10, whereas CD3(F)<U+2192>Rag1(-/-)-M mice displayed a higher activation state in general and T-helper-1-biased renal inflammation. Greater T-cell infiltration into perivascular adipose tissue and kidney associated with increased pressor responses to angiotensin II if the T cell donor was male but not female and these sex differences in T-cell subset expansion and tissue infiltration were maintained for 7 to 8 weeks within the male host. Thus, the adaptive immune response and role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling in hypertension are distinct between the sexes and need to be understood to improve therapeutics for hypertension-associated disease in both men and women.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived factors have been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), occupying the calcium/calmodulin binding site of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and then inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production, is also involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Thus, we investigated whether PVAT regulated vascular tone via Cav-1 and/or endothelial NO pathways. Isometric tension studies were carried out in isolated thoracic aortas from Wistar rats in the presence and absence of PVAT. Concentration-response curves of phenylephrine, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside were illustrated to examine the vascular reactivity and endothelial function. The protein expressions of eNOS and Cav-1 were also examined in aortic homogenates. Our results demonstrated that PVAT significantly enhanced vasoconstriction and inhibited vasodilatation via endothelium-dependent mechanism. The aortic NO production was diminished after PVAT treatment, whereas protein expression and activity of eNOS were not significantly affected. In addition, Cav-1 protein expression was significantly increased in aortas with PVAT transfer. Furthermore, a caveolae depleter methyl-ß-cyclodextrin abolished the effect of PVAT on the enhancement of vasoconstriction, and reversed the impairment of aortic NO production. In conclusion, unknown factor(s) released from PVAT may inhibit endothelial NO production and induce vasocontraction via an increase of Cav-1 protein expression.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) directly abuts the lamina adventitia of conduit arteries and actively communicates with the vessel wall to regulate vascular function and inflammation. Mounting evidence suggests that the biological activities of PVAT are governed by perivascular adipocytes, a unique class of adipocyte with distinct molecular and phenotypic characteristics. Perivascular adipocytes surrounding human coronary arteries (pericoronary perivascular adipocytes) exhibit a reduced state of adipogenic differentiation and a heightened proinflammatory state, secreting =50-fold higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1 compared with adipocytes from other regional depots. Thus, perivascular adipocytes may contribute to upregulated inflammation of PVAT observed in atherosclerotic human blood vessels. However, perivascular adipocytes also secrete anti-inflammatory molecules such as adiponectin, and elimination of PVAT in rodent models has been shown to augment vascular disease, suggesting that some amount of PVAT is required to maintain vascular homeostasis. Evidence in animal models and humans suggests that inflammation of PVAT may be modulated by environmental factors, such as high-fat diet and tobacco smoke, which are relevant to atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that the inflammatory phenotype of PVAT is diverse depending on species, anatomic location, and environmental factors and that these differences are fundamentally important in determining a pathogenic versus protective role of PVAT in vascular disease. Additional research into the mechanisms that regulate the inflammatory balance of perivascular adipocytes may yield new insight into, and treatment strategies for, cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>From an angiogenesis perspective, the ovary offers a unique opportunity to study the physiological development of blood vessels. The first purpose of this work was to set up a protocol for the isolation of pig corpus luteum endothelial cells, which were characterized by both morphologic parameters and the expression of typical molecular markers; we also verified their ability to form capillary-like structures in a 3-dimensional matrix, their response to hypoxia and their migration in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The effectiveness of our isolation protocol was confirmed by the characteristic “cobblestone shape” of isolated cells at confluence as well as their expression of all the examined endothelial markers. Our data also showed a significant cell production of VEGF and nitric oxide. Isolated endothelial cells were also responsive to hypoxia by increasing the expression and production of VEGF and decreasing that of nitric oxide. In the angiogenesis bioassay, cells displayed the ability of forming capillary-like structures and also exhibited a significant migration in the scratch test. Our data suggest that the isolation of luteal endothelial cells represents a promising tool in experiments designed to clarify the biology of the angiogenic process. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the isolated population comprises a subset of cells with a multidifferentiative capacity toward the chondrocytic and adipocytic phenotypes. These data suggest the presence of a perivascular or adventitial cell niche in the vascular wall of the corpus luteum populated with cells showing mesenchymal stem cell-like features, as already demonstrated for the adipose tissue and endometrium.</p>

<p>The sympathetic nervous system and its neurotransmitter effectors are undeniably important to blood pressure control. We made the novel discovery that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contains significant concentrations of catecholamines. We hypothesized that PVAT contains sufficient releasable catecholamines to affect vascular function. HPLC, isometric contractility, immunohistochemistry, whole animal approaches and pharmacology were used to test this hypothesis. In normal rat thoracic aorta and superior mesenteric artery, the indirect sympathomimetic tyramine caused a concentration-dependent contraction that was dependent on the presence of PVAT. Tyramine stimulated release of NA, dopamine (DA) and the tryptamine serotonin (5-HT) from PVAT isolated from both arteries. In both arteries, tyramine-induced concentration-dependent contraction was rightward-shifted and reduced by the noradrenaline transporter inhibitor nisoxetine (1 µM), the vesicular monoamine transporter tetrabenazine (10 µM) and abolished by the a adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin (100 nM). Inhibitors of the DA and 5-HT transporter did not alter tyramine-induced, PVAT-dependent contraction. Removal of the celiac ganglion as a neuronal source of catecholamines for superior mesenteric artery PVAT did not significantly reduce the maximum or shift the concentration dependent contraction to tyramine. Electrical field stimulation of the isolated aorta was not affected by the presence of PVAT. These data suggest that PVAT components that are independent of sympathetic nerves can release NA in a tyramine-sensitive manner to result in arterial contraction. Because PVAT is intimately apposed to the artery, this raises the possibility of local control of arterial function by PVAT catecholamines.</p>

<p>The concept that fat cells could influence the circulation and indeed cardiac function has been in existence for =20 years and has gained a wide interest and no less excitement as evidence has accrued to suggest that such effects may be profound enough to explain disease states, such as hypertension and metabolic changes associated with obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. This ATVB in Focus intends to examine our current knowledge in this field, and suggests mechanisms that may be responsible for normal perivascular function and how they become disordered in obesity. There is the tantalizing prospect of developing new therapeutic approaches to keep obese individuals healthy and redesignating type II diabetes mellitus as a vascular disease.</p>

<p>A powerful interaction between the autonomic and the immune systems plays a prominent role in the initiation and maintenance of hypertension and significantly contributes to cardiovascular pathology, end-organ damage and mortality. Studies have shown consistent association between hypertension, proinflammatory cytokines and the cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The sympathetic nervous system, a major determinant of hypertension, innervates the bone marrow, spleen and peripheral lymphatic system and is proinflammatory, whereas the parasympathetic nerve activity dampens the inflammatory response through a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The neuro-immune synapse is bidirectional as cytokines may enhance the sympathetic activity through their central nervous system action that in turn increases the mobilization, migration and infiltration of immune cells in the end organs. Kidneys may be infiltrated by immune cells and mesangial cells that may originate in the bone marrow and release inflammatory cytokines that cause renal damage. Hypertension is also accompanied by infiltration of the adventitia and perivascular adipose tissue by inflammatory immune cells including macrophages. Increased cytokine production induces myogenic and structural changes in the resistance vessels, causing elevated blood pressure. Cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension may result from the mechanical afterload and the inflammatory response to resident or migratory immune cells. Toll-like receptors on innate immune cells function as sterile injury detectors and initiate the inflammatory pathway. Finally, abnormalities of innate immune cells and the molecular determinants of their activation that include toll-like receptor, adrenergic, cholinergic and AT1 receptors can define the severity of inflammation in hypertension. These receptors are putative therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>Obesity is a metabolic disorder of increasing prevalence worldwide and a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance (IR), metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is related to endothelial dysfunction through indirect mechanisms such as IR and the associated risk factors, and through direct mechanisms including the production of proinflammatory adipokines and elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) by adipose tissue. Both clinical and experimental studies using genetic and diet-induced animal models of obesity have consistently shown impaired metabolic, agonistor flow-induced vasodilatations correlated with the amount of visceral adipose tissue and improved by dietary interventions and exercise. Compromised bioavailability of NO due to oxidative stress emerges as a main cause of endothelial dysfunction in obesity. Inflamed adipose tissue due to hypoxia, and in particular perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), secrete larger amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adipokines that deteriorate NO signaling pathways. Abnormal production and activity of the vasoconstrictor/proatherogenic peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) is also a hallmark of the obesity- associated endothelial dysfunction. Obesity, and in particular visceral obesity, is one of the main causes of IR, and the pathogenic factors that induce endothelial dysfunction in the earlier stages of obesity will further deteriorate the insulin signaling pathways in endothelial cells thus leading to blunted vasodilatation and abnormal capillary recruitment and substrate delivery by insulin to the target tissues. The present review is an attempt to summarize the current knowledge and the latest novel findings on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in obesity, in particular the local contribution of oxidative stress and inflammatory response from PVAT, and its role in the obesity-associated cardiovascular and metabolic complications.</p>

<p>Adipocytes are no longer considered just as cells related to storage of energy and thermoregulation. Now we know that they release a huge number of paracrine and endocrine biologically active molecules. This is also the case for perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) that surrounds almost all blood vessels in the organism. PVAT secretes the so-called adipo(cyto)kines that, because of its proximity, can easily influence vascular smooth muscle cells. The role of PVAT on vascular function can be both protective and deleterious. Normal healthy PVAT, as present in lean subjects, helps to keep the blood vessels dilated as its presence diminishes the effect of vasocontractile agents. Obesity is associated with an increased mass in PVAT. Excessive adipocyte hypertrophy may result in “adiposopathy” in which PVAT attracts macrophages and becomes a more inflammatory phenotype. This leads to a change in profile of the released adipo(cyto)kines, resulting in a decreased vasorelaxing effect of PVAT, which may be linked to obesity-induced hypertension. It also results in smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions. The increased knowledge of PVAT function brings up new targets that can be useful to develop novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. This mini-review presents a general overview of the actual knowledge on the role of PVAT on vascular function and dysfunction in obesity.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), long assumed to be nothing more than vessel-supporting connective tissue, is now understood to be an important, active component of the vasculature, with integral roles in vascular health and disease. PVAT is an adipose tissue with similarities to both brown and white adipose tissue, although recent evidence suggests that PVAT develops from its own precursors. Like other adipose tissue depots, PVAT secretes numerous biologically active substances that can act in both autocrine and paracrine fashion. PVAT has also proven to be involved in vascular inflammation. Although PVAT can support inflammation during atherosclerosis via macrophage accumulation, emerging evidence suggests that PVAT also has antiatherosclerotic properties related to its abilities to induce nonshivering thermogenesis and metabolize fatty acids. We here discuss the accumulated knowledge of PVAT biology and related research on models of hypertension and atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>The identification of multipotent adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) has raised hope that tissue regeneration approaches established with bone-marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSC) can be reproduced with a cell-type that is far more accessible in large quantities. Recent detailed comparisons, however, revealed subtle functional differences between ASC and BMSC, stressing the concept of a common mesenchymal progenitor existing in a perivascular niche across all tissues. Focussing on bone and cartilage repair, this review summarises recent in vitro and in vivo studies aiming towards tissue regeneration with ASC. Advantages of good accessibility, high yield and superior growth properties are counterbalanced by an inferiority of ASC to form ectopic bone and stimulate long-bone healing along with their less pronounced osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression signature. Hence, particular emphasis is placed on establishing whether stem cell activity of ASC is so far proven and relevant for successful osteochondral regeneration, or whether trophic activity may largely determine therapeutic outcome.</p>

<p>Coronary perivascular adipose tissue is a naturally occurring adipose tissue depot that normally surrounds the major coronary arteries on the surface of the heart. Although originally thought to promote vascular health and integrity, there is a growing body of evidence to support that coronary perivascular adipose tissue displays a distinct phenotype relative to other adipose depots and is capable of producing local factors with the potential to augment coronary vascular tone, inflammation, and the initiation and progression of coronary artery disease. The purpose of the present review is to outline previous findings about the cardiovascular effects of coronary perivascular adipose tissue and the potential mechanisms by which adipose-derived factors may influence coronary vascular function and the progression of atherogenesis.</p>

<p>Understanding how the precise interactions of nerves, immune cells, and adipose tissue account for cardiovascular and metabolic biology is a central aim of biomedical research at present. A long standing paradigm holds that the vascular wall is composed of three concentric tissue coats (tunicae): intima, media, and adventitia. However, large- and medium-sized arteries, where usually atherosclerotic lesions develop, are consistently surrounded by periadventitial adipose tissue (PAAT), we recently designated tunica adiposa (in brief, adiposa like intima, media, and adventitia). Today, atherosclerosis is considered an immune-mediated inflammatory disease featured by endothelial dysfunction/intimal thickening, medial atrophy, and adventitial lesions associated with adipose dysfunction, whereas hypertension is characterized by hyperinnervation-associated medial thickening due to smooth muscle cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia. PAAT expansion is associated with increased infiltration of immune cells, both adipocytes and immunocytes secreting pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory (metabotrophic) signaling proteins collectively dubbed adipokines. However, the role of vascular nerves and their interactions with immune cells and paracrine adipose tissue is not yet evaluated in such an integrated way. The present review attempts to briefly highlight the findings in basic and translational sciences in this area focusing on neuro-immune-adipose interactions, herein referred to as triactome. Triactome-targeted pharmacology may provide a novel therapeutic approach in cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue expansion requires growth and proliferation of adipocytes and the concomitant expansion of their stromovascular network. We have used an ex vivo angiogenesis assay to study the mechanisms involved in adipose tissue expansion. In this assay, adipose tissue fragments placed under pro-angiogenic conditions form sprouts composed of endothelial, perivascular, and other proliferative cells. We find that sprouting was directly stimulated by insulin and was enhanced by prior treatment of mice with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. Moreover, basal and insulin-stimulated sprouting increased progressively over 30 weeks of high fat diet feeding, correlating with tissue expansion during this period. cDNA microarrays analyzed to identify genes correlating with insulin-stimulated sprouting surprisingly revealed only four positively correlating (Fads3, Tmsb10, Depdc6, and Rasl12) and four negatively correlating (Asph, IGFbp4, Ppm1b, and Adcyap1r1) genes. Among the proteins encoded by these genes, IGFbp4, which suppresses IGF-1 signaling, has been previously implicated in angiogenesis, suggesting a role for IGF-1 in adipose tissue expandability. Indeed, IGF-1 potently stimulated sprouting, and the presence of activated IGF-1 receptors in the vasculature was revealed by immunostaining. Recombinant IGFbp4 blocked the effects of insulin and IGF-1 on mouse adipose tissue sprouting and also suppressed sprouting from human subcutaneous adipose tissue. These results reveal an important role of IGF-1/IGFbp4 signaling in post-developmental adipose tissue expansion.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The hypothesis of this study is that long-term high-fat diets (HFD) induce perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) dysfunction characterized by a redox imbalance, which might contribute to aggravate endothelial dysfunction in obesity.METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice were fed either control or HFD (45% kcal from fat) for 32 weeks. Body weight, lumbar and mesenteric adipose tissue weights were significantly higher in HFD animals compared to controls. The anticontractile effect of PVAT in mesenteric arteries (MA) was lost after 32 week HFD and mesenteric endothelial-dependent relaxation was significantly impaired in presence of PVAT in HFD mice (Emax<U+200A>=<U+200A>71.0±5.1 vs Emax<U+200A>=<U+200A>58.5±4.2, p&lt;0.001). The inhibitory effect of L-NAME on Ach-induced relaxation was less intense in the HFD group compared with controls suggesting a reduction of endothelial NO availability. Expression of eNOS and NO bioavailability were reduced in MA and almost undetectable in mesenteric PVAT of the HFD group. Superoxide levels and NOX activity were higher in PVAT of HFD mice. Apocynin only reduced contractile responses to NA in HFD animals. Expression of ec-SOD and total SOD activity were significantly reduced in PVAT of HFD mice. No changes were observed in Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD or catalase. The ratio [GSSG]/([GSH]+[GSSG]) was 2-fold higher in the mesenteric PVAT from HFD animals compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the imbalance between pro-oxidant (NOX, superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide) and anti-oxidant (eNOS, NO, ecSOD, GSSG) mechanisms in PVAT after long-term HFD might contribute to the aggravation of endothelial dysfunction.</p>

<p>Ectopic adipose tissue in skeletal muscle is implicated in the development of insulin resistance, which is frequently induced by abnormal dietary habits such as excessive eating and a high-fat diet. However, the characteristics of ectopic adipocytes are unknown. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of ectopic adipocytes in the skeletal muscle of spontaneously hypertensive corpulent congenic (SHR/NDmc-cp) rats as a model of insulin resistance from excessive eating. SHR/NDmc-cp rats displayed overt insulin resistance with high plasma glucose, insulin, and triacylglycerol concentrations relative to control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In contrast, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated WKY rats had high glucose but low insulin concentrations. Ectopic adipocytes were found around blood vessels in the gastrocnemius in SHR/NDmc-cp rats. Areas of perivascular adipocytes and protein expression of resistin were greater in SHR/NDmc-cp rats than in control and STZ-treated WKY rats. The level of the phosphorylated (active) form of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the gastrocnemius was lower in SHR/NDmc-cp rats than in the other groups. Insulin-resistant SHR/NDmc-cp rats showed enlarged perivascular adipocytes and greater endothelial cell dysfunction in the gastrocnemius.</p>

<p>The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and contributes to many health problems, including kidney disease. Unexpectedly, 10-30% of obese individuals are apparently not at increased risk of metabolic diseases, e.g. type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and risk of renal disease. Their phenotype is labeled ‘metabolically healthy obesity’. In the search for mechanisms explaining this unexpected condition, a favourable type of body fat distribution with low insulin resistance and with low subclinical inflammation has been identified. Furthermore, signalling pathways have been found that distinguish between metabolically benign and malignant obesity. In addition, the important roles of fatty acids, adipokines and hepatokines were identified. These factors regulate insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation. Onset and evolution of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are affected by obesity. CKD also increases the risk of insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation, two pathways that play an important role in the pathogenesis of renal malfunction. This brief review summarizes novel insights, specifically how distinct body fat compartments (including perivascular and even renal sinus fat) may have an impact on progression of CKD.</p>

<p>AIMS: It has been demonstrated previously that inflammation in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) may be implicated in vascular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional responses of small mesenteric arteries in a hyperphagic animal model of obesity after chronic treatment with melatonin, an endogenous hormone with antioxidant and vasculoprotective properties.METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten obese mice (ob/ob) and 10 control lean mice (CLM) were treated with melatonin 100<U+200A> mg/kg per day in the drinking water for 8 weeks. Mesenteric small resistance arteries were dissected and mounted on a wire myograph and a concentration-response to norepinephrine was evaluated in vessels with intact PVAT and after PVAT was removed and in the presence of iberiotoxin, a selective blocker of BKCA channels as well as under conditions of induced hypoxia in vitro. The presence of PVAT reduced the contractile response to norepinephrine in both ob/ob and CLM; however, the effect was significantly reduced in ob/ob. The anticontractile effect of PVAT completely disappeared with iberiotoxin preincubation. After melatonin treatment, inflammation was significantly ameliorated, and the contractile response in ob/ob and CLM was significantly reduced when PVAT was removed. Anticontractile effect of PVAT that is lost in obesity can be rescued using melatonin. A reduced expression of adiponectin and adiponectin receptor was observed in perivascular fat of ob/ob, whereas significant increase was observed in ob/ob treated with melatonin.CONCLUSION: Melatonin seems to exert a protective effect on arteries from both ob/ob and CLM, counteracting the adverse effect of hypoxia and iberiotoxin.</p>

<p>We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) would result in increased adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. In particular, we utilized the obese Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty rat model (n = 20) and lean Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka counterparts (n = 20) to determine the extent to which chronic inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) with N (<U+03C9>) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) treatment (for 4 weeks) upregulates expression of inflammatory genes and markers of immune cell infiltration in retroperitoneal white AT, subscapular brown AT, periaortic AT as well as in its contiguous aorta free of perivascular AT. As expected, relative to lean rats (% body fat = 13.5 ± 0.7), obese rats (% body fat = 27.2 ± 0.8) were hyperlipidemic (total cholesterol 77.0 ± 2.1 vs. 101.0 ± 3.3 mg/dL), hyperleptinemic (5.3 ± 0.9 vs. 191.9 ± 59.9 pg/mL), and insulin-resistant (higher HOMA IR index [3.9 ± 0.8 vs. 25.2 ± 4.1]). Obese rats also exhibited increased expression of proinflammatory genes in perivascular, visceral, and brown ATs. L-NAME treatment produced a small but statistically significant decrease in percent body fat (24.6 ± 0.9 vs. 27.2 ± 0.8%) and HOMA IR index (16.9 ± 2.3 vs. 25.2 ± 4.1) in obese rats. Further, contrary to our hypothesis, we found that expression of inflammatory genes in all AT depots examined were generally unaltered with L-NAME treatment in both lean and obese rats. This was in contrast with the observation that L-NAME produced a significant upregulation of inflammatory and proatherogenic genes in the aorta. Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic NOS inhibition alters transcriptional regulation of proinflammatory genes to a greater extent in the aortic wall compared to its adjacent perivascular AT, or visceral white and subscapular brown AT depots.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several reports described the migration of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) towards tumor-released factors. Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is produced by several tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to analyze AMF involvement on MSC migration towards human HCC.METHODS: Production of AMF by HCC tumors was evaluated by western analysis. The effects of AMF on MSCs from different sources (bone marrow, adipose tissue and perivascular cells from umbilical cord) were analyzed using in vitro migration assay; metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity and expression of critical genes were studied by zymography and qRT-PCR, respectively. To assess AMF involvement on the in vivo MSC migration, noninvasive fluorescence imaging was performed. To test the effect of AMF-primed MSCs on tumor development, in vitro proliferation and spheroids growth and in vivo tumor volume were evaluated.RESULTS: AMF produced by HCC was found to induce migration of different MSCs in vitro and to enhance their MMP2 activity. Stimulation of MSCs with recombinant AMF (rAMF) also induced the in vitro adhesion to endothelial cells in coincidence with changes in the expression levels of MMP3, AMF receptor, caveolin-1, and -2 and GDI-2. Importantly, stimulation of MSCs with rAMF increased the in vivo migration of MSCs towards experimental HCC tumors. AMF-priming of MSCs did not induce a pro-tumorigenic effect on HCC cells neither in vivo nor in vitro.CONCLUSION: AMF plays a role in MSC recruitment towards HCC. However, its ability to increase MSC migration to HCC for therapeutic purposes merits further evaluation.</p>

<p>Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca1 or Ly6A/E) is a cell surface marker that is widely expressed in mesenchymal stem cells, including adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). We hypothesized that the fat depot-specific gene signature of Sca1(high) ASCs may play the major role in defining adipose tissue function and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in a depot-specific manner. Herein we aimed to characterize the unique gene signature and ECM remodeling of Sca1(high) ASCs isolated from subcutaneous (inguinal) and visceral (epididymal) adipose tissues. Sca1(high) ASCs are found in the adventitia and perivascular areas of adipose tissues. Sca1(high) ASCs purified with magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) demonstrate dendrite or round shape with the higher expression of cytokines and chemokines (e.g., Il6, Cxcl1) and the lower expression of a glucose transporter (Glut1). Subcutaneous and visceral fat-derived Sca1(high) ASCs particularly differ in the gene expressions of adhesion and ECM molecules. While the expression of the major membrane-type collagenase (MMP14) is comparable between the groups, the expressions of secreted collagenases (MMP8 and MMP13) are higher in visceral Sca1(high) ASCs than in subcutaneous ASCs. Consistently, slow but focal MMP-dependent collagenolysis was observed with subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived vascular stromal cells, whereas rapid and bulk collagenolysis was observed with visceral adipose tissue-derived cells in MMP-dependent and -independent manners. These results suggest that the fat depot-specific gene signatures of ASCs may contribute to the distinct patterns of ECM remodeling and adipose function in different fat depots.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived leptin is a detrimental adipocytokine and plays a critical role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in metabolic syndrome (MetS). During vascular remodeling, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo phenotypic switching into a synthetic phenotype characterized by decreased expression of differentiation markers (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, a-smooth muscle actin, and calponin) and increased proliferation. We aimed to determine whether PVAT-derived leptin influences VSMC phenotypic switching and to explore the underlying mechanisms in MetS rats. In vivo, 32 Wistar rats were divided into two groups that received either a normal diet (control rat) or a high-fat diet (MetS rats). After 16 weeks, rat aortas were stained using hematoxylin-eosin and imaged. VSMC differentiation markers and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), PVAT-derived leptin, aortic leptin receptor (ObR), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression were detected. In vitro, aortic VSMCs were incubated with MetS rat PVAT conditioned medium (PVAT-CM) to mimic in vivo conditions and were pretreated with a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) or leptin antagonist. Differentiation marker expression, including PCNA and p38 MAPK, was detected. MetS rats exhibited pronounced insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and an associated increase in PVAT weight. VSMCs underwent phenotypic switching in MetS rat aorta and contributed to vascular remodeling. PVAT-derived leptin expression was higher in MetS rats than in control rats (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01). ObRa expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were upregulated in MetS rat aorta. In vitro, VSMCs incubated with MetS rat PVAT-CM underwent phenotypic switching, associated with increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation. This VSMC phenotypic switching was inhibited by pretreatment with SB 203580 or a leptin antagonist. These results suggest that in MetS rats, PVAT-derived leptin promotes VSMC phenotypic switching via a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway to exacerbate vascular remodeling.</p>

<p>The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue is an easy to obtain source of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs). We and others have achieved significant but suboptimal therapeutic effects with ADSCs in various settings, mainly due to low rates of differentiation into specific cell types and with the downside of undesired side effects as a consequence of the undifferentiated ADSCs. These data prompted us to find new stem cell-specific markers for ADSCs and/or subpopulations with higher differentiation potential to specific lineages. We found a subpopulation of human ADSCs, marked by c-Kit positiveness, resides in a perivascular location, and shows higher proliferative activity and self-renewal capacity, higher telomerase activity and expression, higher in vitro adipogenic efficiency, a higher capacity for the maintenance of cardiac progenitors, and higher pancreatogenic and hepatogenic efficiency independently of CD105 expression. Our data suggests that the isolation of ADSC subpopulations with anti-c-Kit antibodies allows for the selection of a more homogeneous subpopulation with increased cardioprotective properties and increased adipogenic and endodermal differentiation potential, providing a useful tool for specific therapies in regenerative medicine applications.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: The self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells are controlled by both intrinsic factors and the surrounding microenvironment, which is known as the stem cell niche. Although the niches of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are composed of diverse factors within the adipose tissue, the mechanisms by which niches are maintained, regulated and harmonized to support the ASCs are just beginning to be discovered.AREAS COVERED: This review introduces the recent advances in the anatomic nature of the dynamic in vivo niches of ASCs. Additionally, new findings concerning the signaling pathways involved in the self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation and paracrine mechanisms will be described. Finally, we suggest optimized methods for expanding ASCs in vitro by mimicking the niche factors to enhance the regenerative potential of ASCs.EXPERT OPINION: Fibroblast growth factor 2 is a self-renewal factor that can expand the lifespan of ASCs in long-term culture and platelet-derived growth factor-B/D has most potent mitogenic effects on short-term ASC expansion. Reactive oxygen species donors and stimulators of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B and MAPK pathways can be used to increase the production yield of ASCs. Additionally, hypoxia can increase the proliferation of ASCs and priming under hypoxic conditions enhances the regenerative potential of ASCs.</p>

<p>Systemic knockout of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the pivotal enzyme of triglyceride lipolysis, results in a murine phenotype that is characterized by progredient cardiac steatosis and severe heart failure. Since cardiac and vascular dysfunction have been closely related in numerous studies we investigated endothelium-dependent and -independent vessel function of ATGL knockout mice. Aortic relaxation studies and Langendorff perfusion experiments of isolated hearts showed that ATGL knockout mice suffer from pronounced micro- and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction. Experiments with agonists directly targeting vascular smooth muscle cells revealed the functional integrity of the smooth muscle cell layer. Loss of vascular reactivity was restored ~50% upon treatment of ATGL knockout mice with the PPARa agonist Wy14,643, indicating that this phenomenon is partly a consequence of impaired cardiac contractility. Biochemical analysis revealed that aortic endothelial NO synthase expression and activity were significantly reduced in ATGL deficiency. Enzyme activity was fully restored in ATGL mice treated with the PPARa agonist. Biochemical analysis of perivascular adipose tissue demonstrated that ATGL knockout mice suffer from perivascular inflammatory oxidative stress which occurs independent of cardiac dysfunction and might contribute to vascular defects. Our results reveal a hitherto unrecognized link between disturbed lipid metabolism, obesity and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>With excess nutrition, the burden of obesity is a growing problem worldwide. The imbalance between energy intake and expenditure leads to variable disorders as all major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There are many hypothetical mechanisms to explain obesity-associated hypertension. Activation of the RAAS is a key contributing factor in obesity. Particularly, the RAAS in adipose tissue plays a crucial role in adipose tissue dysfunction and obesity-induced inflammation. The phenotypic changes of adipocytes occur into hypertrophy and an inflammatory response in an autocrine and paracrine manner to impair adipocyte function, including insulin signaling pathway. Adipose tissue produce and secretes several molecules such as leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and visfatin, as well as cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1. These adipokines are stimulated via the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate inflammation of adipose tissue. Inflammation and oxidative stress in adipose tissue are important to interact with the microvascular endothelium in the mechanisms of obesity-associated hypertension. Increased microvascular resistance raises blood pressure. Therefore, a regulatory link between microvascular and perivascular adipose tissue inflammation and adipokine synthesis are provided to explain the mechanism of obesity-associated hypertension.</p>

<p>Ovarian hormone loss increases reactive oxidative species, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease. Because perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) regulates endothelial function, we hypothesized that reactive oxidative species in PVAT mediate adverse microvascular effects of ovarian hormone deficiency. Rats were ovariectomized or sham operated and given vehicle or tempol for 6 weeks. Mesenteric resistance arterioles from ovariectomized compared with sham-operated rats had dysfunctional responses to acetylcholine (ACh) including decreased ACh-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (50±6% versus 72±2%) and endothelium-dependent relaxation factor (17±4% versus 37±2%) and increased endothelium-dependent contracting factor (27±5% versus 9±3%). OVX rat mesenteric arterioles had increased contractions to the thromboxane/prostanoid receptor agonist U-46 619 (58±3% versus 40±5%) and increased reactive oxidative species (tempo-9-AC fluorescence) with U-46 619 (0.65±0.17 versus 0.14±0.06 <U+0394> unit) or ACh (0.49±0.09 versus 0.09±0.05 <U+0394> unit) and increased p22(phox) protein expression (0.89±0.05 versus 0.18±0.04 <U+0394> unit), whereas nitric oxide activity (DAF-FM [4-amino-5-methylamino-2’,7’-difluorofluorescein diacetate] fluorescence) with ACh was reduced (0.39±0.1 versus 0.70±0.10 <U+0394> unit). No differences were found in endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor or contractile responses to phenylephrine. PVAT enhanced ACh-induced relaxation, endothelium-dependent relaxation factor, and nitric oxide only in sham-operated rats. Tempol prevented ovariectomy-induced endothelial dysfunction and restored the enhancing effects of PVAT on ACh-induced relaxation, endothelium-dependent relaxation factor, and nitric oxide in ovariectomized rat vessels, but both tempol and PVAT were required to normalize the enhanced U-46 619 contractions after ovariectomy. In conclusion, ovariectomy redirects endothelial responses from relaxation to contraction by reducing vascular nitric oxide, augmenting thromboxane/prostanoid receptor signaling, and attenuating the vasodilatory effects of PVAT, all of which were dependent on reactive oxidative species.</p>

<p>AIMS: We assessed the impact of vascular and perivascular tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) on the endothelin (ET)-1/nitric oxide (NO) system and the molecular pathways involved in small arteries from visceral fat of obese patients (Obese) and Controls.METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated small arteries from 16 Obese and 14 Controls were evaluated on a pressurized micromyograph. Endogenous ET-1 activity was assessed by the ETA blocker BQ-123. TNF-a and NO were tested by anti-TNF-a infliximab (IFX) and N(<U+03C9>)-nitro-l-arginine methylester (L-NAME). Gene and protein expression of TNF-a, ET-1, ETA, and ETB receptors were determined by RT-PCR and IHC on arterial wall and in isolated adipocytes. Obese showed a blunted L-NAME-induced vasoconstriction, which was potentiated by IFX, and an increased relaxation to BQ-123, unaffected by L-NAME but attenuated by IFX. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) removal reversed these effects. Obese showed intravascular superoxide excess, which was decreased by apocynin (NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor), L-NAME, and BQ-123 incubations, and abolished by IFX. An increased vascular expression of ET-1, ETA, and ETB receptors, and higher vascular/perivascular TNF-a and TNF-a receptor expression were also detected. The arterial expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were higher in Obese vs. Controls, and downregulated by IFX.CONCLUSIONS: In small arteries of Obese, PVAT-derived TNF-a excess, and an increased vascular expression of ET-1 and ETA receptor, contribute to the ET-1/NO system imbalance, by impairing tonic NO release. Reactive oxygen species excess, via NAD(P)H oxidase activation, induces the endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling, which in turn generates superoxide and impairs NO production. The up-regulated JNK pathway represents a crucial molecular signalling involved in this process.</p>

<p>The evidence describing the autonomic innervation of body fat is reviewed with a particular focus on the role of the sympathetic neurotransmitters. In compiling the evidence, a strong case emerges for the interaction between autonomic nerves and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Adipocytes have been shown to express receptors for neurotransmitters released from nearby sympathetic varicosities such as adrenoceptors (ARs), purinoceptors and receptors for neuropeptide Y (NPY). Noradrenaline can modulate both lipolysis (via a2- and ß3-ARs) and lipogenesis (via a1- and ß3-ARs). ATP can inhibit lipolysis (via P1 purinoceptors) or stimulate lipolysis (via P2y purinoceptors). NPY, which can be produced by adipocytes and sympathetic nerves, inhibits lipolysis. Thus the sympathetic triad of transmitters can influence adipocyte free fatty acid (FFA) content. Substance P (SP) released from sensory nerves has also been shown to promote lipolysis. Therefore, we propose a mechanism whereby sympathetic neurotransmission can simultaneously activate smooth muscle cells in the tunica media to cause vasoconstriction and alter FFA content and release from adjacent adipocytes in PVAT. The released FFA can influence endothelial function. Adipocytes also release a range of vasoactive substances, both relaxing and contractile factors, including adiponectin and reactive oxygen species. The action of adipokines (such as adiponectin) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) on cells of the vascular adventitia and nerves has yet to be fully elucidated. We hypothesise a strong link between PVAT and autonomic fibres and suggest that this poorly understood relationship is extremely important for normal vascular function and warrants a detailed study.</p>

<p>Tissue engineering chamber (TEC) makes it possible to generate significant amounts of mature, vascularized, stable, and transferable adipose tissue. However, little is known about the role of the chamber in tissue engineering. Therefore, to investigate the role of inflammatory response and the change in mechanotransduction started by TEC after implantation, we placed a unique TEC model on the surface of the groin fat pads in rats to study the expression of cytokines and tissue development in the TEC. The number of infiltrating cells was counted, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression levels in the chamber at multiple time points postimplantation were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue samples were collected at various time points and labeled for specific cell populations. The result showed that new adipose tissue formed in the chamber at day 60. Also, the expression of MCP-1 and VEGF in the chamber decreased slightly from an early stage as well as the number of the infiltrating cells. A large number of CD34+/perilipin- perivascular cells could be detected at day 30. Also, the CD34+/perilipin+ adipose precursor cell numbers increased sharply by day 45 and then decreased by day 60. CD34-/perilipin+ mature adipocytes were hard to detect in the chamber content at day 30, but their number increased and then peaked at day 60. Ki67-positive cells could be found near blood vessels and their number decreased sharply over time. Masson’s trichrome showed that collagen was the dominant component of the chamber content at early stage and was replaced by newly formed small adipocytes over time. Our findings suggested that the TEC implantation could promote the proliferation of adipose precursor cells derived from local adipose tissue, increase angiogenesis, and finally lead to spontaneous adipogenesis by inducing aseptic inflammation and changing local mechanotransduction.</p>

<p>Pericytes are mural cells of the microcirculation that have been shown to play key roles in regulating microvascular morphogenesis and stability throughout each tissue bed and organ system assessed. Of note, recent work has revealed that pericytes share several characteristics with mesenchymal- and adipose-derived stem cells, suggesting there may be lineage-related connections among bona fide pericytes and these vascular “progenitors,” which can assume a perivascular position in association with endothelial cells. Hence, pericyte identity as a mediator of vascular remodeling may be confounded by its close relationships with its progenitors or pluripotent cell counterparts and yet demonstrates their potential utility as cell-based therapies for unmet clinical needs. Crucial to the development of such therapies is a comprehensive understanding of the origin and fate regulating these related cell types as well as the unveiling of the molecular mechanisms by which pericytes and endothelial cells communicate. Such mechanistic inputs, which disrupt normal cellular crosstalk during disease inception and progression, offer opportunities for intervention and are discussed in the context of the vasculopathies accompanying tumor growth, diabetes, and fibrosis.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular adipose tissue (pvAT) may induce a local pro-inflammatory environment, possibly contributing to coronary atherosclerosis. We investigated whether there is a difference in adipocytokine production by pvAT near stenotic and non-stenotic coronary artery segments in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).METHODS: In patients undergoing CABG with or without valve replacement (n = 38) pvAT near stenotic and near non-stenotic coronary segments was harvested. PvAT was incubated ex vivo for 24h. Concentrations of 23 adipocytokines were measured in the supernatants with a Multiplex assay. The number of macrophages (CD68, CD11c, CD206) and lymphocytes (CD45) in pvAT was determined. Differences between stenosis and control pvAT were tested with Wilcoxon signed rank test corrected for multiple comparisons.RESULTS: Production of IL-5, IL-1a, IL-17, IL-18 and IL-23 was higher in control than stenosis pvAT samples (p &lt; 0.0021). Macrophages were more abundant in stenosis than in control pvAT (median n/400× field: 2.3 IQR: 0.3-4.5 versus 1.2 IQR: 0.1-2.5). There was a predominance of M2 macrophages in both stenosis and control pvAT (median n/400× field: macrophages stenosis: M1: 0.0; M2: 1.0 p = 0.004; control: M1: 0.0; M2: 0.6 p = 0.013). The relation between adipocytokine production and macrophage infiltration was not different in stenosis and control pvAT.CONCLUSION: In patients with CAD, multiple adipocytokines were secreted at higher levels by pvAT near non-stenotic than near stenotic coronary artery segments. Furthermore, pvAT macrophages are associated with stenosis of the adjacent vessel. M2 macrophages were more abundant than M1 macrophages in pvAT.</p>

<p>Most blood vessels are surrounded by a variable amount of adventitial adipose tissue, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which was originally thought to provide mechanical support for the vessel. It is now known that PVAT secretes a number of bioactive substances including vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), leptin, adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor, interleukin-6, plasminogen activator substance, resistin and angiotensinogen. Several studies have shown that PVAT significantly modulated vascular smooth muscle contractions induced by a variety of agonists and electrical stimulation by releasing adipocyte-derived relaxing (ADRF) and contracting factors. The identity of ADRF is not yet known. However, several vasodilators have been suggested including adiponectin, angiotensin 1-7, hydrogen sulfide and methyl palmitate. The anticontractile effect of PVAT is mediated through the activation of potassium channels since it is abrogated by inhibiting potassium channels. Hypertension is characterized by a reduction in the size and amount of PVAT and this is associated with the attenuated anticontractile effect of PVAT in hypertension. However, since a reduction in size and amount of PVAT and the attenuated anticontractile effect of PVAT were already evident in prehypertensive rats with no evidence of impaired release of ADRF, there is the possibility that the anticontractile effect of PVAT was not directly related to an altered function of the adipocytes per se. Hypertension is characterized by low-grade inflammation and infiltration of macrophages. One of the adipokines secreted by macrophages is TNF-a. It has been shown that exogenously administered TNF-a enhanced agonist-induced contraction of a variety of vascular smooth muscle preparations and reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Other procontractile factors released by the PVAT include angiotensin II and superoxide. It is therefore possible that the loss could be due to an increased amount of these proinflammatory and procontractile factors. More studies are definitely required to confirm this.</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS: Fetuin-A (alpha2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein), a liver-derived circulating glycoprotein, contributes to lipid disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In a previous study we found that perivascular fat cells (PVFCs) have a higher angiogenic potential than other fat cell types. The aim was to examine whether fetuin-A influences PVFC and vascular cell growth and the expression and secretion of proinflammatory and angiogenic proteins, and whether TLR4-independent pathways are involved.METHODS: Mono- and co-cultures of human PVFCs and endothelial cells were treated with fetuin-A and/or palmitate for 6-72 h. Proteins were quantified by ELISA and Luminex, mRNA expression by real-time PCR, and cell growth by BrDU-ELISA. Some PVFCs were preincubated with a nuclear factor <U+03BA>B NF<U+03BA>Bp65 inhibitor, or the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor CLI-095, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitors and/or stimulated with insulin. Intracellular forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), NF<U+03BA>Bp65 and inhibitor of <U+03BA>B kinase ß (IKKß) localisation was visualised by immunostaining.RESULTS: PVFCs expressed and secreted IL-6, IL-8, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PLGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Fetuin-A upregulated IL-6 and IL-8, and this was potentiated by palmitate and blocked by CLI-095. Immunostaining and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed partial NF<U+03BA>Bp65 activation. MCP-1 was upregulated and blocked by CLI-095, but not by palmitate. However, HGF was downregulated, which was slightly potentiated by palmitate. This effect persisted after TLR4 pathway blockade. Stimulation of insulin-PI3K-Akt signalling by insulin resulted in nuclear FoxO1 extrusion and HGF upregulation. Fetuin-A counteracted these insulin effects.INTERPRETATION: Fetuin-A and/or palmitate influence the expression of proinflammatory and angiogenic proteins only partially via TLR4 signalling. HGF downregulation seems to be mediated by interference with the insulin-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. Fetuin-A may also influence angiogenic and proinflammatory proteins involved in atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is an active endocrine and paracrine organ that modulates vascular function, with implications for the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adipocytes and stromal cells contained within PVAT produce mediators (adipokines, cytokines, reactive oxygen species and gaseous compounds) with a range of paracrine effects modulating vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, proliferation and migration. However, the modulatory effect of PVAT on the vascular system in diseases, such as obesity, hypertension and atherosclerosis, remains poorly characterized. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates adipocyte metabolism, adipose biology and vascular function, and hence may be a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the vascular complications associated with obesity and T2DM. The role of AMPK in PVAT or the actions of PVAT have yet to be established, however. Activation of AMPK by pharmacological agents, such as metformin and thiazolidinediones, may modulate the activity of PVAT surrounding blood vessels and thereby contribute to their beneficial effect in cardiometabolic diseases. This review will provide a current perspective on how PVAT may influence vascular function via AMPK. We will also attempt to demonstrate how modulating AMPK activity using pharmacological agents could be exploited therapeutically to treat cardiometabolic diseases.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). One important feature underlying the pathophysiology of many types of CVD is microvascular dysfunction. Although components of MetS are themselves CVD risk factors, the risk is increased when the syndrome is considered as one entity. We aimed to characterize microvascular function and some of its influencing factors in the course of MetS development.METHODS: Development of MetS in C57BL/6 mice on a high-fat diet (HFD, 51% of energy from fat) was studied. The initial phase of MetS (I-MetS) was defined as the first 2 weeks of HFD feeding, with the fully developed phase occurring after 8 weeks of HFD. We characterized these phases by assessing changes in adiposity, blood pressure, and microvascular function. All data are presented as mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>standard error (SEM). Differences between cumulative dose-response curves of myograph experiments were calculated using non-linear regression analysis. In other experiments, comparisons between two groups were made with Student’s t-test. Comparisons between more than two groups were made using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test. A probability value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: I-MetS mice presented with weight gain, blood pressure elevation, and microvascular dysfunction characterized by augmented vasoconstriction. This finding, contrary to those in mice with fully developed MetS, was not associated with endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, or systemic inflammation. In the initial phase, perivascular adipose tissue showed no sign of inflammation and had no influence on the pattern of vasoconstriction. These findings suggest that the onset of hypertension in MetS is strongly influenced by vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction and independent of important factors known to influence microvascular function and consequently blood pressure levels.CONCLUSION: We identified in I-MetS the occurrence of isolated augmented vasoconstriction along with blood pressure elevation, but not the presence of classical MetS components known to influence microvascular function. These findings increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of CVD risk associated with MetS.</p>

<p>We review the morphofunctional characteristics of CD34+ stromal fibroblastic/fibrocytic cells (CD34+ SFCs) and report our observations. We consider the following aspects of CD34+ SFCs: A) The confusing terms applied to this cell type, often combining the prefix CD34 with numerous names, including fibroblasts, fibrocytes, dendrocytes, keratocytes, telocytes and stromal, dendritic, adventitial, supraadventitial, perivascular, paravascular and delimiting cells; B) Changes in their immunophenotype, e.g., loss of CD34 expression and gain of other markers, such as those defining mesenchymal and derivate cells (myofibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes); C) Morphology (elongated or triangular cell body and thin, moniliform, bipolar or multipolar cytoplasmic processes), immunohistochemistry (co-expression of and changes in molecular expression) and structure (characteristics of nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles, and points of contact and junctions in quiescent and activated stages by light and electron microscopy); D) Location and distribution in the vessels (adventitia or external layer), in the tissues (connective, adipose, blood, muscle and nervous) and in the organs and systems (skin, oral cavity and oropharynx, respiratory, digestive, urinary, male, female, endocrine and lymphoid systems, serosal and synovial membranes, heart, eye and meninges); E) Origin from the mesoderm and cranial neural crest in the embryo, and from stem cells (themselves or other cells) and/or peripheral blood pluripotent stem cells (circulating progenitor cells) in post-natal life; F) Functions, such as synthesis of different molecules, progenitor of mesenchymal cells, immunomodulation, parenchymal regulation (growth, maturation and differentiation of adjacent cells), induction of angiogenesis, scaffolding support of other cells and phagocytic properties. Since CD34+ SFCs are the main reservoir of tissue mesenchymal cells (great mesenchymal potential, probably higher than that proposed for pericytes and other stromal cells), we dedicate a broad section to explain their in vivo behaviour during proliferation and differentiation in different physiologic and pathologic conditions, in addition to their characteristics in the human tissues of origin (adult stem cell niches); G) Involvement in pathological processes, e.g., repair (regeneration and repair through granulation tissue), fibrosis, tumour stroma formation and possible CD34+ SFC-derived tumours (e.g., solitary fibrous tumour, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, giant cell fibroblastoma, nuchal-type fibroma, mammary and extramammary myofibroblastoma, spindle and pleomorphic cell lipoma, and elastofibroma) and H) Clinical and therapeutic implications.</p>

<p>Obese women (body mass index =30 kg/m(2)) are at greater risk than normal weight women of pregnancy complications associated with maternal and infant morbidity, particularly the development of cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders in later life; why this occurs is unknown. Nonpregnant, obese individuals exhibit systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that obese pregnant women have altered myometrial arterial function compared to pregnant women of normal (18-24 kg/m(2)) and overweight (25-29 kg/m(2)) body mass index. Responses to vasoconstrictors, U46619 (thromboxane mimetic) and arginine vasopressin, and vasodilators, bradykinin and the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside, were assessed by wire myography in myometrial arteries from normal weight (n = 18), overweight (n = 18), and obese (n = 20) women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Thromboxane-prostanoid receptor expression was assessed using immunostaining in myometrial arteries of normal weight and obese women. Vasoconstriction and vasodilatation were impaired in myometrial arteries from obese women with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies. Disparate agonist responses suggest that vascular function in obese women is not globally dysregulated but may be specific to thromboxane and nitric oxide pathways. Because obesity rates are escalating, it is important to identify the mechanisms underlying impaired vascular function and establish why some obese women compensate for vascular dysfunction and some do not. Future studies are needed to determine whether central adiposity results in an altered endocrine milieu that may promote vascular dysfunction by altering the function of perivascular adipose tissue.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of erythropoietin on vascular contractility using an in vitro model of hypoxia replicating the hypoxic environment of blood vessels and surrounding adipose tissue in obesity.METHODS AND RESULTS: Pharmacological in vitro studies were carried out on small mesenteric arterial segments from male Wistar rats with and without perivascular fat and endothelium. Contractile responses were investigated by wire myography under normoxia, experimental hypoxia ± erythropoietin and l-NNA. Perivascular fat exerted an anticontractile effect which was lost following the induction of experimental hypoxia. Erythropoietin prevented the loss of the anticontractile capacity when vessels were incubated for one hour before the induction of hypoxia or throughout the period of hypoxia; this was found to be independent of the function of perivascular fat, as fat denuded arteries had a similar reduction in contractility (artery no fat + hypoxia vs. artery no fat + hypoxia + erythropoietin). The mechanism by which erythropoietin was exerting its effect was found to be partially endothelium dependent and associated with an increase of nitric oxide bioavailability as nitric oxide synthase inhibition prevented the effect.CONCLUSIONS: Whilst erythropoietin is working downstream from perivascular fat, it is possible that it may be therapeutically useful in obesity when hypoxia and inflammation reduce the normal activity of perivascular fat.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Smoking is a recognized cardiovascular risk factor. Perivascular visceral adipose tissue (PVAT) is a source of inflammatory molecules, thus contributing to atherosclerosis progression. The P2X7 receptor (P2X7 R)-inflammasome complex, crucial in determining IL-1ß and IL-18 release, participates in this scenario. We evaluated whether smoking might affect the PVAT inflammatory phenotype and explored the putative role of the axis P2X7 R-inflammasome in this picture.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: TNFa, IL-6, RBP4, MCP-1, as well as P2X7 R and inflammasome components NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and IL-1ß and IL-18 expression was determined in adipocytes isolated by PVAT of healthy smokers (Smok) and nonsmokers (No-Smok) subjects. Plasma and culture medium levels of these cytokines were also determined.RESULTS: Perivascular adipose tissue of Smok had a higher expression of P2X7 R and inflammasome components; via P2X7 R activation, it released more IL-1ß and IL-18, whose serum levels were also higher in Smok than in No-Smok. Linear correlations of NLRP3 with P2X7 R and IL-18 expression and release emerged. Smok also had a higher PVAT expression of the chemotactic factor MCP-1. However, no difference was observed in the PVAT expression of genes more strictly related to insulin resistance, like TNFa, RBP4, IL-6; this was coupled with similar plasma levels of TNFa and RBP4 in the two groups.CONCLUSION: Smoking contributes to the pro-inflammatory status of the PVAT by enhancing expression and activity of the P2X7 R-inflammasome complex; the effect on adipocytokines more related to insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities appears trivial.</p>

<p>We tested the hypothesis that superoxide signaling within aortic perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) contributes to large elastic artery stiffening in old mice. Young (4-6 months), old (26-28 months), and old treated with 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPOL), a superoxide scavenger (1 mm in drinking water for 3 weeks), male C57BL6/N mice were studied. Compared with young, old had greater large artery stiffness assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV, 436 ± 9 vs. 344 ± 5 cm s(-1)) and intrinsic mechanical testing (3821 ± 427 vs. 1925 ± 271 kPa) (both P &lt; 0.05). TEMPOL treatment in old reversed both measures of arterial stiffness. Aortic PVAT superoxide production was greater in old (P &lt; 0.05 vs. Y), which was normalized with TEMPOL. Compared with young, old controls had greater pro-inflammatory proteins in PVAT-conditioned media (P &lt; 0.05). Young recipient mice transplanted with PVAT from old compared with young donors for 8 weeks had greater aPWV (409 ± 7 vs. 342 ± 8 cm s(-1)) and intrinsic mechanical properties (3197 ± 647 vs. 1889 ± 520 kPa) (both P &lt; 0.05), which was abolished with TEMPOL supplementation in old donors. Tissue-cultured aortic segments from old in the presence of PVAT had greater mechanical stiffening compared with old cultured in the absence of PVAT and old with PVAT and TEMPOL (both, P &lt; 0.05). In addition, PVAT-derived superoxide was associated with arterial wall hypertrophy and greater adventitial collagen I expression with aging that was attenuated by TEMPOL. Aging or TEMPOL treatment did not affect blood pressure. Our findings provide evidence for greater age-related superoxide production and pro-inflammatory proteins in PVAT, and directly link superoxide signaling in PVAT to large elastic artery stiffness.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and progenitor cell (MPC) populations in human dermis remain poorly characterized, despite their importance to wound repair and the pathogenesis of many skin diseases. To identify MSC/MPC populations in human dermis we developed an 11-marker flow cytometry technique that enabled sorting of mesenchymal cell populations for functional assays, using adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) from human adipose tissue as a positive control. Two populations of dermal cells had similar phenotypes to ASCs: both were CD34(+) CD73(+) CD105(-)/low, and lacked expression of c-kit (CD117) and hematopoietic or vascular markers (CD31, CD45, CD146, and HLA-DR). However, whereas ASCs were CD36(+/-) CD90(+), dermal mesenchymal progenitor cells (DMPCs) were split between a dominant CD36(-) CD90(+) population (DMPC1) and a small CD36(+) CD90(-) population (DMPC2). Both these populations were capable of differentiating into adipocytes, but only DMPC1 localized to a perivascular location, similar to that reported for ASCs. Re-gating of the flow cytometry data revealed that both DMPC1 and DMPC2 were part of CD45(-) CD73(+) CD146(-) populations with variable expression of CD34. This suggests that CD34 may not be a stable marker of DMPC populations in human dermis, consistent with data from MSCs in human bone marrow, and with the loss of CD34 we observed from both ASCs and DMPCs on cell culture. These data enable future study of DMPCs in health and disease, and may also explain why some mesenchymal cell lines derived from human dermis exhibit characteristics of MSCs.</p>

<p>Most blood vessels are surrounded by adipose tissue. Similarly to the adventitia, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) was considered only as a passive structural support for the vasculature, and it was routinely removed for isolated blood vessel studies. In 1991, Soltis and Cassis demonstrated for the first time that PVAT reduced contractions to noradrenaline in rat aorta. Since then, an important number of adipocyte-derived factors with physiological and pathophysiological paracrine vasoactive effects have been identified. PVAT undergoes structural and functional changes in obesity. During early diet-induced obesity, an adaptative overproduction of vasodilator factors occurs in PVAT, probably aimed at protecting vascular function. However, in established obesity, PVAT loses its anticontractile properties by an increase of contractile, oxidative, and inflammatory factors, leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease. The aim of this review is to focus on PVAT dysfunction mechanisms in obesity.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The extravascular expression of inflammatory mediators may adversely influence coronary lesion formation and plaque stability through outside-to-inside signalling. It has been shown that the maximal standardised uptake value (SUV) of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose detected by positron emission tomography (PET/CT) is proportional to macrophage density.AIM: To investigate whether the inflammatory activity of pericoronary adipose tissue (PVAT) may influence plaque composition in acute coronary syndrome without persistent ST-segment elevation (NSTE-ACS) patients.METHODS: In a prospective study, 36 coronary arteries (LM, RCA, LCX, LAD) were investigated in non-diabetic patients with a low or intermediate risk of NSTE-ACS (GRACE = 140). SUV was measured in fat surrounding coronary arteries on the sections corresponding to proximal and medial segments (Siemens biograph 64-PET/CT system). Additionally, SUV was measured in subcutaneous fat (SC), visceral thoracic fat (VS), and epicardial fat over the right ventricle (EPI). Virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) was performed to assess plaque composition (Volcano, USA). PET/CT sections were further examined in segments corresponding to coronary plaques.RESULTS: PVAT SUV in NSTE-ACS patients was significantly greater than in other fat locations (LM SUV: 1.60; RCA SUV: 1.54; LCX SUV: 1.94; LAD SUV: 2.37 vs.SC SUV: 0.57; VS SUV: 0.77; EPI SUV: 0.98; p &lt; 0.001; ANOVA). PVAT SUV positively correlated with plaque burden (r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.05) and necrotic core plaque rate (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with fibrous plaque rate (r = -0.52, p &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory activity of PVAT reflected by SUV is greater than in subcutaneous, visceral thoracic, or epicardial tissue in NSTE-ACS patients; PVAT SUV correlates with the plaque burden and necrotic core component of coronary plaque.</p>

<p>Obesity and arterial hypertension, important risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, are characterized by an increase in vascular tone. While obesity is known to augment vasoconstrictor prostanoid activity in endothelial cells, less is known about factors released from fat tissue surrounding arteries (perivascular adipose). Using lean controls and mice with either monogenic or diet-induced obesity, we set out to determine whether and through which pathways perivascular adipose affects vascular tone. We unexpectedly found that in the aorta of obese mice, perivascular adipose potentiates vascular contractility to serotonin and phenylephrine, indicating activity of a factor generated by perivascular adipose, which we designated “adipose-derived contracting factor” (ADCF). Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) fully prevented ADCF-mediated contractions, whereas COX-1 or COX-2-selective inhibition was only partially effective. By contrast, inhibition of superoxide anions, NO synthase, or endothelin receptors had no effect on ADCF activity. Perivascular adipose as a source of COX-derived ADCF was further confirmed by detecting increased thromboxane A2 formation from perivascular adipose-replete aortae from obese mice. Taken together, this study identifies perivascular adipose as a novel regulator of arterial vasoconstriction through the release of COX-derived ADCF. Excessive ADCF activity in perivascular fat under obese conditions likely contributes to increased vascular tone by antagonizing vasodilation. ADCF may thus propagate obesity-dependent hypertension and the associated increased risk in coronary artery disease, potentially representing a novel therapeutic target.</p>

<p>AIMS: We have studied the vasoactive role of prostaglandins derived from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and their effects on endothelial function in healthy rats and rats with metabolic syndrome (SHROB).MAIN METHODS: Mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) from SHROB and control rats (WKY) were mounted on wire myographs: a) together with a sphere of naturally occurring perivascular adipose tissue (with-PVAT group), or b) dissecting all the adventitial tissue (without-PVAT group).KEY FINDINGS: Endothelial function, tested by acetylcholine reactivity of SHROB arteries with PVAT, was significantly lower than that of WKY. With-PVAT arteries, especially the SHROB, showed lower responses than those without PVAT. NO synthase inhibition diminished the acetylcholine responses in every group except the with-PVAT SHROB group. Blockade of cyclooxygenase-2, PGI2-IP, TXA2-TP, or TXA2 synthase increased to different extents the arterial responses in the SHROB with-PVAT group. PVAT from both rat strains revealed cyclooxygenase-2 activity and immunoassay confirmed the release of PGE2, PGI2 and TXA2.SIGNIFICANCE: Our major finding is that PVAT is a source of vasoactive prostaglandins in WKY and SHROB. We also report that the presence of visceral PVAT causes endothelial dysfunction of resistance arteries in the SHROB. The vascular responses to prostaglandins partly underlie the endothelial dysfunction of SHROB arteries.</p>

<p>Epidemiological studies support the notion that arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events contributing significantly to systolic hypertension, impaired ventricular-arterial coupling and diastolic dysfunction, impairment in myocardial oxygen supply and demand, and progression of kidney disease. Although arterial stiffness is associated with aging, it is accelerated in the presence of obesity and diabetes. The prevalence of arterial stiffness parallels the increase of obesity that is occurring in epidemic proportions and is partly driven by a sedentary life style and consumption of a high fructose, high salt, and high fat western diet. Although the underlying mechanisms and mediators of arterial stiffness are not well understood, accumulating evidence supports the role of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. The local tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the vascular tissue and immune cells and perivascular adipose tissue is recognized as an important element involved in endothelial dysfunction which contributes significantly to arterial stiffness. Activation of vascular RAAS is seen in humans and animal models of obesity and diabetes, and associated with enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation in the vascular tissue. The cross talk between angiotensin and aldosterone underscores the importance of mineralocorticoid receptors in modulation of insulin resistance, decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness. In addition, both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in this local tissue activation of RAAS. In this review we will attempt to present a unifying mechanism of how environmental and immunological factors are involved in this local tissue RAAS activation, and the role of this process in the development of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness and targeting tissue RAAS activation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Traditional CVD and SLE-disease related risk factors do not fully account for this increased risk. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a visceral adipose depot in close proximity to blood vessels possibly influencing CVD. We hypothesized that women with SLE have an increased volume of descending thoracic aortic PVAT (aPVAT) associated with increased vascular calcification.METHODS: Using electron beam computed tomography, we quantified the aPVAT in clinically CVD-free SLE women (n = 135) and age-/race-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 152). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) and aortic calcification (AC) were quantified using Agatston scores and the aPVAT was quantified using standard Hounsfield Units (HU) for adipose tissue.RESULTS: Women with SLE had greater median aPVAT (32.2 cm(3) vs HC aPVAT 28.6 cm(3), p = 0.0071) and greater median AC (26.0 vs HC AC 6.0, p = 0.0013) than the healthy control women. Total aPVAT (per 25 cm(3)) remained significantly associated with SLE after adjusting for CVD risk factors (Odds Ratio 1.74 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.04-2.9], p = 0.034), but was attenuated when adjusting for circulating inflammatory markers (p = 0.34). In a logistic regression analysis, SLE aPVAT (per 25 cm(3)) was associated with AC (6.78 [2.0-23], p = 0.0019), which remained significant after adjusting for circulating inflammatory markers (p = 0.0074), and CAC (2.66 [1.4-5.0], p = 0.0028).CONCLUSIONS: Total aPVAT is greater in clinically CVD-free SLE women than in age-/race-matched controls and is associated with calcification in different vascular beds.</p>

<h4>Endogenous hydrogen sulfide in perivascular adipose tissue: role in the regulation of vascular tone in physiology and pathology.</h4>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is synthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine <U+03B3>-lyase (CSE), and is enzymatically metabolized in mitochondria by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR). Recent studies have indicated that H2S is synthesized by CSE in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), and is responsible for the anticontractile effect of PVAT on adjacent vessels. The lipophilic statin atorvastatin increases PVAT-derived H2S by suppressing its mitochondrial oxidation; the effect that results from statin-induced depletion of ubiquinone. Experimental obesity induced by a highly palatable diet has a time-dependent effect on H2S in PVAT. Adipose tissue hypoxia suppresses H2S oxidation and increases its level in short-term obesity not associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, in long-term obesity, insulin resistance and (or) hyperinsulinemia result in the down-regulation of CSE and H2S deficiency, which is corrected by treatment with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist administered for 2 weeks increases H2S by impairing mitochondria biogenesis. This indicates that the rate of mitochondrial H2S oxidation plays an important role in the regulation of H2S level in PVAT. Up-regulation of H2S signaling in short-term obesity and (or) by elevated endocannabinoids may be a compensatory mechanism that maintains vascular tone, despite endothelial dysfunction.</p>

<p>AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in mediating the anticontractile function of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and whether its activation can rescue PVAT activity which is lost in an experimental model of inflammation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Contractile responses to norepinephrine were assessed using wire myography from small arterial segments obtained from PKG(-/-), PKG(+/+), adipo(-/-), and C57Bl6/J mice with and without PVAT during normal oxygenation and hypoxia. An anticontractile effect of PVAT was observed in control blood vessels. This was not present in arteries from PKG(-/-) or PKG(+/+) with inhibition of PKG signalling using DT-2/ODQ. Hypoxia-induced loss of PVAT function was rescued by ANP activation of PKG as there was no effect in blood vessels from PKG(-/-) mice or in the presence of DT-2. Solution transfer studies demonstrated that PKG was necessary for the normal paracrine effects of PVAT on smooth muscle and endothelium. PKG activation by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) did not restore the absent PVAT anticontractile capacity in arteries from adiponectin(-/-) mice; however, inhibition of PKG did not further abrogate this effect suggesting dysregulation of PKG signalling pathways in this model. The absence of PKG was associated with reduced adipocyte adiponectin expression.CONCLUSION: PKG plays a key role in regulating normal PVAT function both in modulating anticontractile factor release from adipocytes as well as being essential for its downstream dilator function in arterial smooth muscle.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is implicated in the development of vascular diseases; however, the roles of PVAT on OPN expression in diabetic vasculature remain to be determined. This study investigated the role of adipokines derived from diabetic PVAT in regulating the vascular expression of OPN and explored the mechanisms involved. Aortic sections of ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mice showed an increased expression of OPN, which was paralleled by increased amounts of PVAT characterized by enlargement of adipocytes. In the earlier phase of HFD feeding, macrophage infiltration was mainly localized to the area of PVAT at which adipocytes were enlarged, suggesting a potential link of activated adipocytes to macrophage infiltration. PVAT sections of ob/ob and DIO mice revealed a significantly greater number of macrophages with increased expression of adipokines, including resistin and visfatin. The distribution of resistin in PVAT mostly co-localized with macrophages, while visfatin was expressed in macrophages and other cells. In in vitro studies, OPN expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) co-cultured with PVAT of DIO mice was significantly increased, which was attenuated by a resistin-neutralizing antibody. Likewise, resistin up-regulated expression of OPN mRNA and protein in cultured VSMCs and the pivotal role of AP-1 in resistin-induced OPN transcription was demonstrated. Resistin produced by PVAT plays a pivotal role in the up-regulated expression of OPN in the diabetic vasculature via a signalling pathway that involves activation of AP-1.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue, which has been considered mainly as a site of energy storage and mobilization, is found in many depots throughout the body. Adipose depots may have structural properties such as, for instance, the fat pads located in the hands and feet and the periorbital fat supporting the eyes. Adipose tissue also shows remarkable regional heterogeneity. For instance, substantial differences have been reported in the metabolic properties of visceral (intra-abdominal) vs. subcutaneous adipose depots. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has active endocrine and paracrine functions with the secretion of various pro-inflammatory chemokines potentially contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis related with obesity. In addition, adipose depots surrounding the heart, such as epicardial (EAT) and perivascular adipose tissues (PAT) may also exert important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease beyond the contribution of VAT due to their close anatomic relationships with vascular structures and myocardium. The purpose of the present review is to outline the current understanding of the pathophysiological links between EAT, PAT and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Also, we discuss the current investigative methods for PAT quantification and discuss the potential impact of PAT on cardiovascular risk prediction. Finally, potential clinical implications of these notions are discussed.</p>

<p>Given that the variation in how regional adipose tissue handles and stores excess dietary energy has substantial cardiometabolic implications, ectopic fat distribution might be an important predictor of cardiometabolic and vascular risk, in addition to overall obesity itself. Conceptually, ectopic fat depots may be divided into systemically acting fat depots and locally acting fat depots. Systemically acting fat depots include visceral fat, fat in the liver, muscle, or neck, and subcutaneous fat. Accumulation in the abdominal visceral area, compared with overall obesity, has an equally or more important role in the development of cardiometabolic risk. Fat depots in liver/muscle tissue cause adverse cardiometabolic effects by affecting energy metabolism. Fat depots in lower-body subcutaneous areas may be protective regarding cardiometabolic risk, by trapping remnant energy. Fat accumulation in the neck is a unique type of fat depot that may increase cardiovascular risk by increasing insulin resistance. Locally acting fat depots include pericardial fat, perivascular fat, and renal sinus fat. These fat depots have effects primarily on adjacent anatomic organs, directly via lipotoxicity and indirectly via cytokine secretion. Pericardial fat is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. Perivascular fat may play an independent role in adverse vascular biology, including arterial stiffness. Renal sinus fat is a unique fat depot that may confer additional cardiometabolic risk. Thus, ectopic fat depots may contribute to the understanding of the link between body composition and cardiometabolic risk. In this review, we focus on the role and clinical implications of ectopic fat depots in cardiometabolic and vascular risk.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features, immunophenotype and genetic changes of perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComa).METHODS: A total of 25 cases of PEComa located in various anatomic sites were selected for immunohistochemical staining (SP or EnVision method). TFE3 fluorescence in-situ hybridization was also performed to determine the TFE3 gene status.RESULTS: The age of patient ranged from 21 to 61 years (mean = 43 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1: 1.3. Histologically, 22 cases represented conventional angiomyolipomas, composed of a mixture of adipose tissue, spindle element, epithelioid smooth muscle cells and abnormal thick-walled blood vessels in various proportions. Three cases involving lung, soft tissue and broad ligament had subtle but distinctive morphologic features. Nested or sheet-like architecture with epithelioid or spindle cells was observed. Immunohistochemical study showed that HMB 45, melan A, smooth muscle actin and cathepsin K were expressed in 80% (20/25), 88% (22/25), 88% (22/25) and 100% (25/25) of PEComa, respectively. Within positive cases, the average proportion of positive tumor cells was 36%, 41%, 35% and 90% respectively for HMB 45, melan A, smooth muscle actin and cathepsin K. TFE3 was negative in all of the 22 renal and hepatic PEComa studied, while it was positive in the 3 cases of extra-hepatorenal PEComa. None of the 25 cases exhibited evidence of TFE3 gene fusion or amplification.CONCLUSIONS: Extra-hepatorenal PEComa have distinctive morphologic features and are associated with TFE3 overexpression. Cathepsin K immunostaining demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in PEComa, better than other commonly employed immunomarkers. This marker is thus useful in diagnosis of PEComa and distinction with other neoplasms.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue modifies the development of cardiovascular disease in a complex manner: obesity is a major risk factor, especially when accompanied by a central fat distribution. For that reason the characteristics of visceral adipose tissue have attracted most of the research interest thus far, and measurement of waist circumference is now recommended for everyday clinical practice. However, the direct, causative role of visceral fat in cardiometabolic disease remains to be established. Epidemiological and clinical studies show that accumulation of fat subcutaneously, in the gluteofemoral area, is protective against cardiovascular disease, but the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the last few years, imaging has allowed the study of smaller fat depots that may interact locally with important tissues: epicardial fat with the myocardium, perivascular fat with the vessel wall and the developing atherosclerotic plaque, and renal sinus fat with the renal artery. Unraveling the heterogeneous fat distribution and metabolic phenotypes in human obesity will facilitate optimal assessment of cardiovascular risk in overweight and obese individuals.</p>

<p>It has beed showed that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) of human internal thoracic artery (ITA) releases adventitia/adipocyte-derived relaxing factor (ADRF). The precise mechanism of vasodilatatory effect of ADRF is still unknown. It was suggested that various potassium channels may be involved in the action of ADRF. The aim of this study was to assess the involvment of potassium channels in the vasorelaxing properties of ADRF in human internal thoracic artery. Human ITA rings were studied in vitro. First the ability of perivascular tissue of human ITA to release ADRF to the bath was checked. In subsequent experiments two fragments of skeletonised ITA were used to assess the involvement of various potassium channels in vasorelaxing action of PVAT. Segment of ITA, precontracted with serotonin (10(-5.5)M), was relaxed by adding PVAT to tissue bath, first without and then in the presence of appropriate potassium channel blocker. Second segment served as a control (no addition of PVAT). The magnitude of relaxation was measured and compared between preparations. This protocol was used to analyze the influence of iberiotoxin (100 nM), apamin (1 uM), 4-aminopyridine (1 mM, 5 mM), BaCl2 (100 uM) and glibenclamide (10 uM). The addition of PVAT to precontracted skeletonized ITA caused significant vasorelaxation (54.6±8.03 mN versus 33.7±6.58 mN p=0.03). Similar effect was seen when 5 ml of aliquot from separate incubation of PVAT was added (36.3±5.45 mN versus 20.7±3.02 mN; p&lt;0.001). PVAT dependent relaxation was blocked in the presence of Ca<U+207A>² dependent potassium channel blocker iberiotoxin (47.4±16.67 mN versus 43.3±14.54 mN; p=0.36) and 4-aminopyridine (5 mM) (59.3±3.54 mN versus 51.6±4.77 mN; p=0.12). We conclude that perivascular adipose tissue of human ITA releases relaxing factor that seems to act with the involvement of Ca<U+207A>² dependent potassium channels.</p>

<p>Cell-based therapies promise important developments for regenerative medicine purposes. Adipose tissue and the adipogenic process has become central to an increasing number of translational efforts in addition to plastic and reconstructive surgical applications. In recent experimental clinical trials, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proven to be well tolerated because of their low immunoreactivity. MSC are multipotent cells found among mature cells in different tissues and organs with the potentiality to differentiate in many cell types, including osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes, thus being a suitable cell source for tissue engineering strategies. We compared the adipogenic potential of MSC originated from two adult sources as fat pads and bone marrow, and from four foetal sources as umbilical cord blood, Wharton’s jelly, amniotic fluid and preterm umbilical cord perivascular cells. Surprisingly, adult MSC displayed higher differentiation capacities confirmed by gene expression analysis on a selected panel of adipogenesis-related genes. Further, an in-depth molecular analysis highlighted the early and vigorous activation of the PPAR<U+03B3> transcription factor-cascade in adipose-derived MSC that resulted to be both delayed and reduced in foetal MSC accounting for their lack of adipogenic potential. Thus, MSC show a different degree of phenotypic plasticity depending on the source tissue, that should be taken into consideration for the selection of the most appropriate MSC type for specific tissue regeneration purposes.</p>

<p>To determine whether high free fatty acids (FFA) could affect the anti-contractile properties of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in rat aortas. Wistar rats were divided into normal, obesity and fenofibrate groups and fed a normal, high-fat, and high-fat plus fenofibrate diet, respectively. Thoracic aortas with or without PVAT (PVAT+ and PVAT-) were prepared with either intact endothelium (E+) or with endothelium removed (E-). Aortas pre-treated with either 500µmol/L of palmitic acid (PA) or physiological salt solution (PSS), as a control, were used for in vitro study. Concentration-dependent responses of aortas to norepinephrine were measured. The anti-contractile effects of PVAT were attenuated in both obese rats with high FFA levels and in the PA group in the presence of endothelium, but not in the absence of endothelium. The attenuation of the anti-contractile effect was restored by reducing FFA levels in the fenofibrate group (P&lt;0.05). Incubation of aortas (PVAT+ E+) with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) in the normal group caused attenuation of the anti-contractile effect of PVAT (P&lt;0.05). Incubation of aortas (PVAT+ E+) in the obese and PA groups with a NO donor, anti-TNF-a antibodies or free radical scavengers partially restored the anti-contractile effect of PVAT (P&lt;0.05). Under both acute and chronic conditions, high FFA levels could attenuate the anti-contractile properties of PVAT by an endothelium-dependent rather than an endothelium-independent mechanism, in which inflammation and oxidative stress may play important roles.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), deposited around subepicardial coronary vessels, may contribute directly to perivascular inflammation and smooth muscle cell proliferation. This study assessed the relationship between EAT and in-stent restenosis.METHODS: Four hundred and seven patients had received successful coronary intervention. EAT thickness was measured by echocardiography. Angiographic follow-up was obtained between 6 months and 2 years. Restenosis was defined as target lesion revascularization (TLR). EAT thickness of patients was compared by TLR controlling for additional well-known predictors of restenosis. The TLR-free survival analysis according to EAT thickness was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the differences between groups were assessed by the log-rank test.RESULTS: Median EAT thickness was significantly increased in patients undergoing TLR compared with those without restenosis (3.7 vs. 3.0 mm, p = 0.001). EAT thickness was one of the independent factors associated with restenosis (Odds ratio = 1.19, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.33, p = 0.007). The TLR-free survival of patients with thick EAT was significantly worse than patients with thin EAT (log-rank p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: EAT thickness is related with restenosis and may provide additional information for future restenosis.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue secrets adipokines and fatty acids, which may contribute to obesity-associated vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study investigated which factors are responsible for the synergistic effect of adipokine and oleic acid- (OA-) induced proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Adipocyte-conditioned medium (CM) from human adipocytes induces proliferation of VSMC in correlation to its vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) content. CM increases VEGF-receptor (VEGF-R) 1 and 2 expression and VEGF secretion of VSMC, while OA only stimulates VEGF secretion. VEGF neutralization abrogates CM- and OA-induced proliferation and considerably reduces proliferation induced by CM and OA in combination. VEGF release is higher from visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese subjects compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and VAT from lean controls. Furthermore, VEGF release from VAT correlates with its proliferative effect. Perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) from type 2 diabetic patients releases significantly higher amounts of VEGF and induces stronger proliferation of VSMC as compared to SAT and SAT/PAT of nondiabetics. In conclusion, VEGF is mediating CM-induced proliferation of VSMC. As this adipokine is released in high amounts from VAT of obese patients and PAT of diabetic patients, VEGF might link adipose tissue inflammation to increased VSMC proliferation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Endothelin (ET)-1 plays a role in vascular reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. ET-1 has been implicated in human atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. ET-1 overexpression exacerbates high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E(-/-) (Apoe(-/-)) mice. ET-1-induced reactive oxygen species and inflammation may contribute to atherosclerosis progression and AAA development.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Eight-week-old male wild-type mice, transgenic mice overexpressing ET-1 selectively in endothelium (eET-1), Apoe(-/-) mice, and eET-1/Apoe(-/-) mice were fed high-fat diet for 8 weeks. eET-1/Apoe(-/-) had a 45% reduction in plasma high-density lipoprotein (P&lt;0.05) and presented = 2-fold more aortic atherosclerotic lesions compared with Apoe(-/-) (P&lt;0.01). AAAs were detected only in eET-1/Apoe(-/-) (8/21; P&lt;0.05). Reactive oxygen species production was increased = 2-fold in perivascular fat, media, or atherosclerotic lesions in the ascending aorta and AAAs of eET-1/Apoe(-/-) compared with Apoe(-/-) (P&lt;0.05). Monocyte/macrophage infiltration was enhanced = 2.5-fold in perivascular fat of ascending aorta and AAAs in eET-1/Apoe(-/-) compared with Apoe(-/-) (P&lt;0.05). CD4(+) T cells were detected almost exclusively in perivascular fat (3/6) and atherosclerotic lesions (5/6) in ascending aorta of eET-1/Apoe(-/-) (P&lt;0.05). The percentage of spleen proinflammatory Ly-6C(hi) monocytes was enhanced 26% by ET-1 overexpression in Apoe(-/-) (P&lt;0.05), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 was increased 2-fold in plaques of eET-1/Apoe(-/-) (P&lt;0.05) compared with Apoe(-/-).CONCLUSIONS: ET-1 plays a role in progression of atherosclerosis and AAA formation by decreasing high-density lipoprotein, and increasing oxidative stress, inflammatory cell infiltration, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in perivascular fat, vascular wall, and atherosclerotic lesions.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: HIV-infection is characterized by chronic immune activation that persists despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. Whether specific perivascular fat depots are associated with inflammation in HIV is unknown.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, epicardial (EAT) and thoracic periaortic (TAT) adipose tissue volumes were measured by computed tomography in 100 HIV-infected adults, on stable ART, with LDL-cholesterol =130 mg/dL and evidence of heightened T-cell activation (CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ =19%) or increased inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein =2 mg/L).RESULTS: Overall, 77% were males and 70% African American. Mean (standard deviation) age and body mass index were 47 (10) years and 28 (6.4) kg/m(2), respectively. All subjects had HIV-1 RNA &lt;1000 copies/mL with mean (standard deviation) CD4+ T cell count of 665 (280) cells/µL; 50% were on a protease inhibitor. EAT and TAT were correlated with each other (r = 0.766, p &lt; 0.0001). Both were associated with metabolic syndrome, atherogenic lipid profile, insulin resistance, total and central body fat, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and soluble CD163, but not with cellular immune activation markers. In multivariable models that adjusted for age, sex, and other measures of adiposity, both perivascular fat depots were independently associated with the presence of coronary calcium.CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular fat is associated with soluble CD163, biomarkers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and subclinical atherosclerosis in this population of virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients on ART. The association of perivascular fat with coronary artery calcification appears to be independent of other measures of adiposity.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) wraps blood vessels and modulates vasoreactivity by secretion of vasoactive molecules. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) has been shown to control inflammation and is expressed in adipose tissue. In this study, we investigated whether adipose-specific deletion of rictor and thereby inactivation of mTORC2 in PVAT may modulate vascular function by increasing inflammation in PVAT.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Rictor, an essential mTORC2 component, was deleted specifically in mouse adipose tissue (rictor(ad-/-)). Phosphorylation of mTORC2 downstream target Akt at Serine 473 was reduced in PVAT from rictor(ad-/-) mice but unaffected in aortic tissue. Ex vivo functional analysis of thoracic aortae revealed increased contractions and impaired dilation in rings with PVAT from rictor(ad-/-) mice. Adipose rictor knockout increased gene expression and protein release of interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, and tumor necrosis factor-a in PVAT as shown by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Bioplex analysis for the cytokines in the conditioned media, respectively. Moreover, gene and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was upregulated without affecting macrophage infiltration in PVAT from rictor(ad-/-) mice. Inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase normalized vascular reactivity in aortic rings from rictor(ad-/-) mice with no effect in rictor(fl/fl) mice. Interestingly, in perivascular and epididymal adipose depots, high-fat diet feeding induced downregulation of rictor gene expression.CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identify mTORC2 as a critical regulator of PVAT-directed protection of normal vascular tone. Modulation of mTORC2 activity in adipose tissue may be a potential therapeutic approach for inflammation-related vascular damage.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue can be considered as a huge gland producing paracrine and endocrine hormones, the adipo(cyto)kines. There is growing evidence that these adipo(cyto)kines may link obesity to cardiovascular diseases. The excessive adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity induces hypoxia in adipose tissue. This leads to adiposopathy, the process that converts “healthy” adipose tissue to “sick” adipose tissue. This is accompanied by a change in profile of adipo(cyto)kines released, with less production of the “healthy” adipo(cyto)kines such as adiponectin and omentin and more release of the “unhealthy” adipo(cyto)kines, ultimately leading to the development of cardiovascular diseases. The present review provides a concise and general overview of the actual concepts of the role of adipo(cyto)kines in endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, atherosclerosis and heart diseases. The knowledge of these concepts may lead to new tools to improve health in the next generations.</p>

<p>The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of IT on lung function power (P) and oxygen uptake (VO2) at peak performance (peak) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) in CF patients who were unable to participate in a standard exercise program (SEP) and to compare these IT responses with corresponding effects in CF patients performing SEP. 20 patients (FEV1 25.5 ± 7.5%; pred; SpO2 &lt; 90% at rest or P lower than 0.3 W/kg) who were unable to participate in SEP were allocated to IT (5 × 20 min weekly). 23 patients (FEV1 31.6 ± 4.2%; p &lt; 0.05) did 5 × 45 min per week of SEP. Lung function remained unchanged in both groups. VO2peak and PVAT increased in both groups (p &lt; 0.05). However, only after the SEP an increase in Ppeak (p &lt; 0.05) and only after IT a higher VO2VAT (p &lt; 0.05) were found. Compared to SEP, IT improved submaximal exercise capacity to a greater extent whereas responsiveness on peak performance was higher in SEP. This seems to indicate a specific potential of IT for positive peripheral muscular adaptations in spite of diminishing potential of pulmonary improvement. IT represents an alternative, effective and safe training regimen with patients with CF and severe lung disease, with a greater potential than SEP.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent progenitors of great promise for cell therapy. MSCs can mediate tissue regeneration, immunomodulation, and hematopoiesis support. Despite the unique properties of MSCs and their broad range of potential clinical applications, the very nature of these cells has been uncertain. Furthermore, MSCs are heterogeneous and only defined subpopulations of these are endowed with the particular abilities to sustain hematopoietic stem cells, regulate immune responses, or differentiate into mesodermal cell lineages. It is becoming evident that current criteria used to define cultured polyclonal MSCs (expression of nonspecific markers and in vitro mesodermal differentiation) are not sufficient to fully understand and exploit the potential of these cells. Here, we describe how flow cytometry has been used to reveal a perivascular origin of MSCs. As a result, the prospective purification of MSCs and specialized subsets thereof is now possible, and the clinical use of purified autologous MSCs is now within reach.</p>

<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The perivascular adipose tissue is closely implicated in the development of atherosclerosis; however, the contribution to CKD-associated atherogenesis remains undefined. Eight-week-old apoE-deficient mice were uninephrectomized and fed a high-cholesterol diet starting at 12 wk of age. The atherosclerotic lesion area in the thoracic aorta was comparable in 16-wk-old uninephrectomized (UNX) mice and sham control mice; however, the lesion area was markedly exaggerated in 20-wk-old UNX mice compared with the control (54%, P &lt; 0.05). While the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (PAT) did not differ between the two groups, angiotensinogen (AGT) mRNA expression and the angiotensin II (ANG II) concentration in the PAT were significantly higher in 16-wk-old UNX mice than in the control (1.9- and 1.5-fold increases vs. control, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). ANG II concentrations in both the plasma and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) were comparable between the two groups, suggesting that PAT-specific activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is primarily involved in CKD-associated atherogenesis. The homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and plasma insulin level after glucose loading were significantly elevated in 16-wk-old UNX mice. In vitro stimulation of preadipocytes with insulin exaggerated the AGT mRNA expression along with increased mRNA expression of PPAR<U+03B3>. These findings suggest that PAT-specific RAS activation probably primarily contributes in accelerating atherosclerotic development in UNX mice and could thus represent a therapeutic target for preventing CKD-associated atherogenesis.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds most vessels and has now been recognized as a regulator of vascular functions. This effect of PVAT has been mostly demonstrated in vessels obtained from rats and mice. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate anti-contractile effect of PVAT surrounding human coronary bypass grafts such as saphenous vein (SV) and internal mammary artery (IMA). Moreover, we aimed to determine the involvement of prostanoids in the anticontractile effect of PVAT. Human SV and IMA preparations were set up in an organ bath. The presence of PVAT in SV and IMA preparations significantly attenuated the contractile response to noradrenaline (NA). Preincubation with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, increased NA contraction in SV preparations with PVAT. This effect was not observed in IMA preparation with PVAT incubated with indomethacin. The lower measurements of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) released from PVAT surrounding IMA versus SV supported these effects. In conclusion, our results show that PVAT of SV could attenuate NA-induced contraction by releasing both PGE2 and prostacyclin (PGI2). In contrast to SV, PVAT of IMA exerts its anti-contractile effect independently from prostanoids. These observations suggest that retaining PVAT in human SV and IMA preparations may have potential clinical implications to improve coronary bypass graft patency.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular fat may have a local adverse effect on the vasculature. We evaluated whether thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (TAT), a type of perivascular fat, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were associated with vascular function.DESIGN AND METHODS: TAT and VAT were quantified in Framingham Heart Study participants using multidetector-computed tomography; vascular function was assessed using brachial artery vasodilator function, peripheral arterial tone, and arterial tonometry (n = 2,735; 48% women; mean age, 50 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 27.7 kg/m(2) ). Using multiple linear regression, the relationships between TAT, VAT, and vascular measures was examined while adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.RESULTS: Mean TAT and VAT volumes were 13.2 and 1763 cm(3) . TAT and VAT were associated with multiple vascular function measures after multivariable adjustment. After BMI adjustment, TAT and VAT remained negatively associated with peripheral arterial tone and inverse carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (P &lt; 0.02); TAT was negatively associated with hyperemic mean flow velocity (P = 0.03). Associations of TAT with vascular function were attenuated after VAT adjustment (all P &gt; 0.06).CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic periaortic and visceral fat are associated with microvascular function and large artery stiffness after BMI adjustment. These findings support the growing recognition of associations between ectopic fat and vascular function.</p>

<p>Inflammatory cross talk between perivascular adipose tissue and the blood vessel wall has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We previously reported that human perivascular (PV) adipocytes exhibit a proinflammatory phenotype and less adipogenic differentiation than do subcutaneous (SQ) adipocytes. To gain a global view of the genomic basis of biologic differences between PV and SQ adipocytes, we performed genome-wide expression analyses to identify differentially expressed genes between adipocytes derived from human SQ vs. PV adipose tissues. Although &gt;90% of well-expressed genes were similarly regulated, we identified a signature of 307 differentially expressed genes that were highly enriched for functions associated with the regulation of angiogenesis, vascular morphology, inflammation, and blood clotting. Of the 156 PV upregulated genes, 59 associate with angiogenesis, vascular biology, or inflammation, noteworthy of which include TNFRSF11B (osteoprotegerin), PLAT, TGFB1, THBS2, HIF1A, GATA6, and SERPINE1. Of 166 PV downregulated genes, 21 associated with vascular biology and inflammation, including ANGPT1, ANGPTL1, and VEGFC. Consistent with the emergent hypothesis that PV adipocytes differentially regulate angiogenesis and inflammation, cell culture-derived adipocyte-conditioned media from PV adipocytes strongly enhanced endothelial cell tubulogenesis and monocyte migration compared with media from SQ adipocytes. These findings demonstrate that PV adipocytes have the potential to significantly modulate vascular inflammatory crosstalk in the setting of atherosclerosis by their ability to signal to both endothelial and inflammatory cells.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The optimal medical management to delay the progression of aortic aneurysms has not been fully clarified, and the only standard treatment at present is antihypertensive therapy. Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists on cardiovascular remodeling. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a selective MR antagonist on aortic aneurysm progression.METHODS: Seven-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were administered with angiotensin II and ß-aminopropionitrile for 4 weeks. The mice received either vehicle or eplerenone, a selective MR antagonist (100 mg/kg daily) every day by gavage, starting at 7 weeks of age. The production of inflammatory cytokines in cultures of high mobility group box-1-stimulated macrophages with or without a MR antagonist was also analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS: Although no differences were found in the peak systolic blood pressure between the experimental groups, the mice in the eplerenone group showed a significant reduction in aneurysm development. On histologic analysis, coarse and stretched elastic fibers were markedly improved in the aortic wall in the eplerenone group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction of both aortic wall and perivascular adipose tissue demonstrated the expression of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 was significantly decreased in eplerenone group, and that of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in the aortic wall was also significantly decreased. Macrophage infiltration in the aortic wall and perivascular adipose tissue in the eplerenone group was also significantly decreased. The production of tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 in macrophage culture, which was stimulated by high mobility group box-1 and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, was also significantly decreased in the eplerenone group.CONCLUSIONS: Eprelenone suppressed aortic aneurysm progression through an anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, selective MR antagonists might be effective in preventing the progression of aortic aneurysms.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipomas, composed of thick-walled blood vessels, smooth muscle, and adipose tissue, belong to the perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas), a family of tumors believed to be derived from perivascular epithelioid cells which co-express smooth muscle and melanocytic markers. Although most angiomyolipomas are benign, a subset of PEComas has metastatic potential. The pathologic and clinical spectrum of these tumors continues to evolve. We sought to evaluate a subset of renal angiomyolipomas with a minimal amount of fat. We studied 48 renal angiomyolipomas in 41 patients (33 females and 8 males). Based on the amount of adipose tissue, the lesions were categorized as fat-poor, fat-average, and fat-rich lesions (&lt;25, 25-75, and &gt;75 % of fat, respectively). Stains for smooth muscle actin, calponin, HMB-45, melanocyte-associated antigen PNL2, estrogen, and progesterone receptor were examined. Four patients (all females) had more than one lesion, four had coexistent uterine leiomyomata, two had coexistent renomedullary interstitial tumor, and males had only single lesions. Except for one woman, all lesions were sporadic. Twenty-nine were fat-poor (60 %) lesions; 8, fat-average (17 %) lesions; and 11, fat-rich (23 %) lesions. The fat content did not correlate with tumor size: the largest fat-poor and smallest fat-rich lesions were &gt;6 and &lt;2 cm, respectively. All lesions stained with smooth muscle actin and HMB-45; 41 % of tumors were positive for estrogen receptor (11 females and 1 male). No patient had metastases (follow-up 2-11 years). In our series, fat content in angiomyolipoma was not associated with tumor size. Fat-poor angiomyolipomas affected predominantly women and were morphologically and radiologically distinct as mimickers of malignancy. Whether they are biologically different from conventional tumors requires further studies.</p>

<p>AIMS: Neointimal thickening results from inflammation in association with vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. We studied the role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on VSMC proliferation and intima-media thickening (IMT) in a rodent model of chronic inflammation.METHODS: The abdominal aorta and surrounding PVAT of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a-injected mice were examined 28 days after administration. Plasma and PVAT cytokines were measured with Milliplex™ assays. Inflammatory cells were examined with immunofluorescence. Expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and MMP-12 was examined with immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and zymography. IMT was determined. Cell proliferation and TGF-ß1 mRNA levels were examined after treating VSMC with PVAT homogenates ± MMP-2 inhibitors (batimastat, ARP 100 or TIMP-2) and SB-431542, a selective inhibitor of the TGF-ß-type 1 receptor.RESULTS: Significant increases in CD3, CD68, neutrophils, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and MMP-2 in PVAT, and TGF-ß1 and IMT of the aorta of TNF-a-injected mice were observed. PVAT of TNF-a-injected mice significantly up-regulated TGF-ß1 and increased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and was attenuated by SB-431542, batimastat, ARP 100 and TIMP-2.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that chronic PVAT inflammation leads to MMP-mediated increase in TGF-ß1 and hence VSMC proliferation.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign tumor of the kidney, which is composed of a mixture of three tissue components: blood vessels, smooth muscle and adipose cells. Occasionally, AML may extend into the renal vein or the vena cava, but so far at least, intracardiac extension was rarely reported. We herein present one case of renal AML with intracardiac extension and pulmonary embolism simultaneously in a 52-year-old Chinese female patient. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-demarcated heterogeneous mass in the right kidney which extended into the right atrium through the right renal vein and inferior vena cava and resulted in embolization in the right pulmonary artery. The renal mass together with the thrombus was resected. The renal mass and thrombus in vena cava and right atrium shared the similar histological features: mature adipose tissue, smooth muscle and thick-walled vessels. The thrombus in the right pulmonary artery was mainly composed of mature adipose tissue. These histological features and the result of positive immunostaining for HMB-45, Melan-A, and smooth muscle actin supported the diagnosis of AML. The component of epithelioid cells was less than 5% and mitosis was rarely seen. Intracardiac extension is often observed in the malignant tumor and only seldom seen in benign tumors. Our case reminds the rare possibility of intracardiac extension in renal AML, which may potentially result in fatal complications if not appropriately managed.</p>

<p>Leptin has received much attention since its cloning in 1994. Initially, leptin research centered on satiety, energy balance and sympathetic activation. However, hyperleptinemia has since been identified as an independent risk factor for various cardiovascular pathologies including atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Over the last decade, multiple studies have implicated leptin as an important mediator in endothelial dysfunction and neointimal hyperplasia, both key steps in the evolution of atherosclerotic vascular changes. Additionally, more recent evidence indicates that paracrine leptin release from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has deleterious effects on the underlying endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), including the coronary circulation. This report reviews pertinent literature on leptin-mediated endothelial dysfunction, SMC proliferation and the role of PVAT-derived leptin with an emphasis on the coronary circulation and discussions of currently proposed molecular mechanisms of PVAT-mediated coronary endothelial dysfunction and neointimal hyperplasia.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: This investigation examined the mechanisms by which coronary perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived factors influence vasomotor tone and the PVAT proteome in lean versus obese swine.METHODS AND RESULTS: Coronary arteries from Ossabaw swine were isolated for isometric tension studies. We found that coronary (P=0.03) and mesenteric (P=0.04) but not subcutaneous adipose tissue augmented coronary contractions to KCl (20 mmol/L). Inhibition of CaV1.2 channels with nifedipine (0.1 µmol/L) or diltiazem (10 µmol/L) abolished this effect. Coronary PVAT increased baseline tension and potentiated constriction of isolated arteries to prostaglandin F2a in proportion to the amount of PVAT present (0.1-1.0 g). These effects were elevated in tissues obtained from obese swine and were observed in intact and endothelium denuded arteries. Coronary PVAT also diminished H2O2-mediated vasodilation in lean and, to a lesser extent, in obese arteries. These effects were associated with alterations in the obese coronary PVAT proteome (detected 186 alterations) and elevated voltage-dependent increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] in obese smooth muscle cells. Further studies revealed that the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil (1 µmol/L) significantly blunted artery contractions to KCl and PVAT in lean but not obese swine. Calpastatin (10 µmol/L) also augmented contractions to levels similar to that observed in the presence of PVAT.CONCLUSIONS: Vascular effects of PVAT vary according to anatomic location and are influenced by an obese phenotype. Augmented contractile effects of obese coronary PVAT are related to alterations in the PVAT proteome (eg, calpastatin), Rho-dependent signaling, and the functional contribution of K(+) and CaV1.2 channels to smooth muscle tone.</p>

<p>Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) are a potential cell source for autologous cell therapy due to their regenerative ability. However, detailed cytological or phenotypic characteristics of these cells are still unclear. Therefore, we determined and compared cell size, morphology, ultrastructure, and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression profiles of isolated hADMSCs and cells located in human adipose tissues. We also characterized the localization of these cells in vivo. Light microscopy examination at low power revealed that hADMSCs acquired a spindle-shaped morphology after four passages. Additionally, high power views showed that these cells had various sizes, nuclear contours, and cytoplasmic textures. To further evaluate cell morphology, transmission electron microscopy was performed. hADMSCs typically had ultrastructural characteristics similar to those of primitive mesenchymal cells including a relatively high nuclear/cytosol ratio, prominent nucleoli, immature cytoplasmic organelles, and numerous filipodia. Some cells contained various numbers of lamellar bodies and lipid droplets. IHC staining demonstrated that PDGFR and CD10 were constitutively expressed in most hADMSCs regardless of passage number but expression levels of a-SMA, CD68, Oct4 and c-kit varied. IHC staining of adipose tissue showed that cells with immunophenotypic characteristics identical to those of hADMSCs were located mainly in the perivascular adventitia not in smooth muscle area. In summary, hADMSCs were found to represent a heterogeneous cell population with primitive mesenchymal cells that were mainly found in the perivascular adventitia. Furthermore, the cell surface markers would be CD10/PDGFR. To obtain defined cell populations for therapeutic purposes, further studies will be required to establish more specific isolation methods.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide is the “third” gasotransmitter on the rise in cardiovascular research. Recent studies show that hydrogen sulfide has a great potential in the regulation of vascular tone of systemic arteries and many molecular targets are discussed. However, the complex mechanism of vascular tone regulation by hydrogen sulfide is only incompletely understood. It seems that a potent interaction of hydrogen sulfide with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) becomes important in angiogenesis, in the process of wound healing, but also in tumor angiogenesis. Hydrogen sulfide exerts anti-inflammatory effects and it could be a pharmacological target in vascular dysfunction in association with obesity-related hypertension as well as in tumor development and progression. However, the underlying molecular pathways still need to be revealed. This review primarily focuses on the regulatory role of hydrogen sulfide in controlling vascular tone. We attempt to provide recent insights into mechanisms by which CSE-dependent hydrogen sulfide plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone by perivascular adipose tissue. The role of KCNQ channels and other ionic permeation pathways as key targets will be discussed. Recent findings which are summarized in this paper provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide that are crucial for understanding vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular disease and possibly angiogenesis. Future research will be extended to investigate the therapeutic potential of hydrogen sulfide and their targets such as KCNQ channels in cardiovascular diseases, angiogenesis and tumor genesis.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bariatric surgery on small artery function and the mechanisms underlying this.BACKGROUND: In lean healthy humans, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) exerts an anticontractile effect on adjacent small arteries, but this is lost in obesity-associated conditions such as the metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes where there is evidence of adipocyte inflammation and increased oxidative stress.METHODS: Segments of small subcutaneous artery and perivascular fat were harvested from severely obese individuals before (n = 20) and 6 months after bariatric surgery (n = 15). Small artery contractile function was examined in vitro with wire myography, and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) morphology was assessed with immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The anticontractile activity of PVAT was lost in obese patients before surgery when compared with healthy volunteers and was restored 6 months after bariatric surgery. In vitro protocols with superoxide dismutase and catalase rescued PVAT anticontractile function in tissue from obese individuals before surgery. The improvement in anticontractile function after surgery was accompanied by improvements in insulin sensitivity, serum glycemic indexes, inflammatory cytokines, adipokine profile, and systolic blood pressure together with increased PVAT adiponectin and nitric oxide bioavailability and reduced macrophage infiltration and inflammation. These changes were observed despite the patients remaining severely obese.CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery and its attendant improvements in weight, blood pressure, inflammation, and metabolism collectively reverse the obesity-induced alteration to PVAT anticontractile function. This reversal is attributable to reductions in local adipose inflammation and oxidative stress with improved adiponectin and nitric oxide bioavailability.</p>

<p>Arsenic in drinking water promotes a number of diseases that may stem from dysfunctional adipose lipid and glucose metabolism. Arsenic inhibits adipocyte differentiation and promotes insulin resistance; however, little is known of the impacts of and mechanisms for arsenic effects on adipose lipid storage and lipolysis. Based on our earlier studies of arsenic-signaling mechanisms for vascular remodeling and inhibition of adipogenesis, we investigated the hypothesis that arsenic acts through specific adipocyte G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to promote lipolysis and decrease lipid storage. We first demonstrated that 5-week exposure of mice to 100 µg/l of arsenic in drinking water stimulated epididymal adipocyte hypertrophy, reduced the adipose tissue expression of perilipin (PLIN1, a lipid droplet coat protein), and increased perivascular ectopic fat deposition in skeletal muscle. Incubating adipocytes, differentiated from adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cell, with arsenic stimulated lipolysis and decreased both Nile Red positive lipid droplets and PLIN1 expression. Arsenic-stimulated lipolysis was not associated with increased cAMP levels. However, preincubation of adipocytes with the Gi inhibitor, Pertussis toxin, attenuated As(III)-stimulated lipolysis and lipid droplet loss. Antagonizing Gi-coupled endothelin-1 type A and B receptors (EDNRA/EDNRB) also attenuated arsenic effects, but antagonizing other adipose Gi-coupled receptors that regulate fat metabolism was ineffective. The endothelin receptors have different roles in arsenic responses because only EDNRA inhibition prevented arsenic-stimulated lipolysis, but antagonists to either receptor protected lipid droplets and PLIN1 expression. These data support a role for specific GPCRs in arsenic signaling for aberrant lipid storage and metabolism that may contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic disease caused by environmental arsenic exposures.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adiponectin is an adipokine with potentially important roles in human cardiovascular disease states. We studied the role of adiponectin in the cross-talk between adipose tissue and vascular redox state in patients with atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 677 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Endothelial function was evaluated by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery in vivo and by vasomotor studies in saphenous vein segments ex vivo. Vascular superoxide (O2(-)) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling were quantified in saphenous vein and internal mammary artery segments. Local adiponectin gene expression and ex vivo release were quantified in perivascular (saphenous vein and internal mammary artery) subcutaneous and mesothoracic adipose tissue from 248 patients. Circulating adiponectin was independently associated with nitric oxide bioavailability and O2(-) production/eNOS uncoupling in both arteries and veins. These findings were supported by a similar association between functional polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene and vascular redox state. In contrast, local adiponectin gene expression/release in perivascular adipose tissue was positively correlated with O2(-) and eNOS uncoupling in the underlying vessels. In ex vivo experiments with human saphenous veins and internal mammary arteries, adiponectin induced Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation and increased tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability, improving eNOS coupling. In ex vivo experiments with human saphenous veins/internal mammary arteries and adipose tissue, we demonstrated that peroxidation products produced in the vascular wall (ie, 4-hydroxynonenal) upregulate adiponectin gene expression in perivascular adipose tissue via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3>-dependent mechanism.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that adiponectin improves the redox state in human vessels by restoring eNOS coupling, and we identify a novel role of vascular oxidative stress in the regulation of adiponectin expression in human perivascular adipose tissue.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of the expression of PPAR-gamma gene in the adipogenesis in hemangioma evolution.METHODS: Routine immunohistochemistry staining of Perilipin A, the marker antigen of adipocytes, was performed to observe the adipogenesis in hemangioma. Immunofluorescence staining of PPAR-gamma, the important transcription factor in promoting adipogenesis, was carried out to observe its location in hemangioma tissue, with the co-staining of alpha-SMA and CD31. And RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of PPAR-gamma gene in hemangioma in different stages.RESULTS: In the evolution of hemangioma, the number of adipocytes increased continuously. And the tumor was replaced by fibrofatty tissue finally. PPAR-gamma was located in the nuclei of perivascular cell in hemangioma tissue. The expression of PPAR-gamma gene in hemangioma increased in the evolution of hemangioma, but still was lower than that in normal fat tissue from children.CONCLUSION: The expression of PPAR-gamma in the perivascular cells suggests that they may contribute to the adipogenesis in hemangioma involution.</p>

<p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is now recognized as an active contributor to vascular function. Adipocytes and stromal cells contained within PVAT are a source of an ever-growing list of molecules with varied paracrine effects on the underlying smooth muscle and endothelial cells, including adipokines, cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and gaseous compounds. Their secretion is regulated by systemic or local cues and modulates complex processes, including vascular contraction and relaxation, smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and vascular inflammation. Recent evidence demonstrates that metabolic and cardiovascular diseases alter the morphological and secretory characteristics of PVAT, with notable consequences. In obesity and diabetes, the expanded PVAT contributes to vascular insulin resistance. PVAT-derived cytokines may influence key steps of atherogenesis. The physiological anticontractile effect of PVAT is severely diminished in hypertension. Above all, a common denominator of the PVAT dysfunction in all these conditions is the immune cell infiltration, which triggers the subsequent inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypoxic processes to promote vascular dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the currently known mechanisms by which the PVAT influences blood vessel function. The important discoveries in the study of PVAT that have been made in recent years need to be further advanced, to identify the mechanisms of the anticontractile effects of PVAT, to explore the vascular-bed and species differences in PVAT function, to understand the regulation of PVAT secretion of mediators, and finally, to uncover ways to ameliorate cardiovascular disease by targeting therapeutic approaches to PVAT.</p>

<p>This study investigated the role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in the beneficial effects of andrographolide on vascular reactivity in endotoxaemic rats. After being challenged by lipopolysaccharide (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally), the rats were treated with andrographolide (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The response to phenylephrine of aortic rings with or without PVAT was recorded. Vascular relaxing effect of PVAT was determined by bioassay experiments. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in aortic PVAT was tested by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Lipopolysaccharide injection lowered the contraction force induced by phenylephrine in aortic rings with or without PVAT and andrographolide treatment reversed these effects. In bioassay experiments, transferring bathing solution incubated with a PVAT+ ring to a PVAT- ring induced relaxation in the recipient. This relaxing effect of PVAT from endotoxaemic rats was more potent than the rats treated with vehicles. Andrographolide treatment decreased the relaxing effect of PVAT in endotoxaemic rats. The levels of iNOS protein and messenger RNA in PVAT were significantly higher in endotoxaemic rats than in the rats treated with vehicles. Andrographolide treatment decreased PVAT iNOS protein and messenger RNA levels in endotoxaemic rats. Our results suggest that andrographolide restores vascular reactivity in endotoxaemic rats by downregulation of iNOS in PVAT.</p>

<p>METABOLIC SYNDROME IS A CLUSTER OF METABOLIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SYMPTOMS: insulin resistance (IR), obesity, dyslipemia. Hypertension and vascular disorders are central to this syndrome. After a brief historical review, we discuss the role of sympathetic tone. Subsequently, we examine the link between endothelial dysfunction and IR. NO is involved in the insulin-elicited capillary vasodilatation. The insulin-signaling pathways causing NO release are different to the classical. There is a vasodilatory pathway with activation of NO synthase through Akt, and a vasoconstrictor pathway that involves the release of endothelin-1 via MAPK. IR is associated with an imbalance between both pathways in favour of the vasoconstrictor one. We also consider the link between hypertension and IR: the insulin hypothesis of hypertension. Next we discuss the importance of perivascular adipose tissue and the role of adipokines that possess vasoactive properties. Finally, animal models used in the study of vascular function of metabolic syndrome are reviewed. In particular, the Zucker fatty rat and the spontaneously hypertensive obese rat (SHROB). This one suffers macro- and microvascular malfunction due to a failure in the NO system and an abnormally high release of vasoconstrictor prostaglandins, all this alleviated with glitazones used for metabolic syndrome therapy.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Obesity and hypertension are comorbid in epidemic proportion, yet their biological connection is largely a mystery. The peptide chemerin is a candidate for connecting fat deposits around the blood vessel (perivascular adipose tissue) to arterial contraction. We presently tested the hypothesis that chemerin is expressed in perivascular adipose tissue and is vasoactive, supporting the existence of a chemerin axis in the vasculature.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and Western analyses supported the synthesis and expression of chemerin in perivascular adipose tissue, whereas the primary chemerin receptor ChemR23 was expressed both in the tunica media and endothelial layer. The ChemR23 agonist chemerin-9 caused receptor, concentration-dependent contraction in the isolated rat thoracic aorta, superior mesenteric artery, and mesenteric resistance artery, and contraction was significantly amplified (more than 100%) when nitric oxide synthase was inhibited and the endothelial cell mechanically removed or tone was placed on the arteries. The novel ChemR23 antagonist CCX832 inhibited phenylephrine-induced and prostaglandin F2a-induced contraction (+perivascular adipose tissue), suggesting that endogenous chemerin contributes to contraction. Arteries from animals with dysfunctional endothelium (obese or hypertensive) demonstrated a pronounced contraction to chemerin-9. Finally, mesenteric arteries from obese humans demonstrate amplified contraction to chemerin-9.CONCLUSIONS: These data support a new role for chemerin as an endogenous vasoconstrictor that operates through a receptor typically attributed to function only in immune cells.</p>

<p>Human adiposity has long been associated with insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk, and abdominal adiposity is considered particularly adverse. Intra-abdominal fat is associated with insulin resistance, possibly mediated by greater lipolytic activity, lower adiponectin levels, resistance to leptin, and increased inflammatory cytokines, although the latter contribution is less clear. Liver lipid is also closely associated with, and likely to be an important contributor to, insulin resistance, but it may also be in part the consequence of the lipogenic pathway of insulin action being up-regulated by hyperinsulinemia and unimpaired signaling. Again, intramyocellular triglyceride is associated with muscle insulin resistance, but anomalies include higher intramyocellular triglyceride in insulin-sensitive athletes and women (vs men). Such issues could be explained if the “culprits” were active lipid moieties such as diacylglycerol and ceramide species, dependent more on lipid metabolism and partitioning than triglyceride amount. Subcutaneous fat, especially gluteofemoral, appears metabolically protective, illustrated by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in patients with lipodystrophy. However, some studies suggest that deep sc abdominal fat may have adverse properties. Pericardial and perivascular fat relate to atheromatous disease, but not clearly to insulin resistance. There has been recent interest in recognizable brown adipose tissue in adult humans and its possible augmentation by a hormone, irisin, from exercising muscle. Brown adipose tissue is metabolically active, oxidizes fatty acids, and generates heat but, because of its small and variable quantities, its metabolic importance in humans under usual living conditions is still unclear. Further understanding of specific roles of different lipid depots may help new approaches to control obesity and its metabolic sequelae.</p>

<p>Various autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), including rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus, are associated with premature atherosclerosis. However, premature atherosclerosis has not been uniformly observed in systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, although experimental models of atherosclerosis support the role of antiphospholipid antibodies in atherosclerosis, there is no clear evidence of premature atherosclerosis in antiphospholipid syndrome (APA). Ischemic events in APA are more likely to be caused by pro-thrombotic state than by enhanced atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in ARDs is caused by traditional and non-traditional risk factors. Besides other factors, inflammation and immunologic abnormalities, the quantity and quality of lipoproteins, hypertension, insulin resistance/hyperglycemia, obesity and underweight, presence of platelets bearing complement protein C4d, reduced number and function of endothelial progenitor cells, apoptosis of endothelial cells, epigenetic mechanisms, renal disease, periodontal disease, depression, hyperuricemia, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea and vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the premature CVD. Although most research has focused on systemic inflammation, vascular inflammation may play a crucial role in the premature CVD in ARDs. It may be involved in the development and destabilization of both atherosclerotic lesions and of aortic aneurysms (a known complication of ARDs). Inflammation in subintimal vascular and perivascular layers appears to frequently occur in CVD, with a higher frequency in ARD than in non-ARD patients. It is possible that this inflammation is caused by infections and/or autoimmunity, which might have consequences for treatment. Importantly, drugs targeting immunologic factors participating in the subintimal inflammation (e.g., T- and B-cells) might have a protective effect on CVD. Interestingly, vasa vasorum and cardiovascular adipose tissue may play an important role in atherogenesis. Inflammation and complement depositions in the vessel wall are likely to contribute to vascular stiffness. Based on biopsy findings, also inflammation in the myocardium and small vessels may contribute to premature CVD in ARDs (cardiac ischemia and heart failure). There is an enormous need for an improved CVD prevention in ARDs. Studies examining the effect of DMARDs/biologics on vascular inflammation and CV risk are warranted.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Recruitment of macrophage precursors to the adventitia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), but molecular mechanisms remain undefined. The innate immune signaling molecule CD14 was reported to be upregulated in adventitial macrophages in a murine model of AAA and in monocytes cocultured with aortic adventitial fibroblasts (AoAf) in vitro, concurrent with increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. We hypothesized that CD14 plays a crucial role in adventitial macrophage precursor recruitment early during AAA formation.METHODS AND RESULTS: CD14(-/-) mice were resistant to AAA formation induced by 2 different AAA induction models: aortic elastase infusion and systemic angiotensin II (AngII) infusion. CD14 gene deletion led to reduced aortic macrophage infiltration and diminished elastin degradation. Adventitial monocyte binding to AngII-infused aorta in vitro was dependent on CD14, and incubation of human acute monocytic leukemia cell line-1 (THP-1) monocytes with IL-6 or conditioned medium from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) upregulated CD14 expression. Conditioned medium from AoAf and PVAT induced CD14-dependent monocyte chemotaxis, which was potentiated by IL-6. CD14 expression in aorta and plasma CD14 levels were increased in AAA patients compared with controls.CONCLUSIONS: These findings link CD14 innate immune signaling via a novel IL-6 amplification loop to adventitial macrophage precursor recruitment in the pathogenesis of AAA.</p>

<p>The contribution of brown and perivascular adipose tissues to the pathophysiology of metabolic and vascular complications associated with obesity are analysed in this review. To combat obesity and prevent its highly prevalent metabolic and vascular complications, a new insight on our knowledge of the role of the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue and its promising therapeutic potential in humans is needed in addition to conventional treatments. Owing to the impact of brown adipose tissue on energy expenditure related to lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as its potential resistance against inflammation along with perivascular adipose tissue, new perspectives in the treatment of obesity treatment could be focused on the design of new drugs, or different regimens or therapies, that increase the amount and activity of brown adipose tissue. These new treatments not only may contribute to combat obesity, but also prevent complications such as type 2 diabetes and other associated metabolic and vascular changes.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that periadventitial adipose tissue may modulate vascular lesion formation. The aim of this study was to determine the role of perivascular leptin expression on neointima formation and to differentiate it from local inflammation and systemically elevated leptin levels.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Increased neointima formation after carotid artery injury was observed in hyperleptinemic, diet-induced obese wild-type mice, but not in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. High-fat diet was associated with increased leptin expression in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as well as in perivascular adipose tissue. Perivascular leptin overexpression achieved by adenoviral vectors enhanced intimal cell proliferation and neointima formation in wild-type mice, but not in leptin receptor-deficient mice. Perivascular transplantation of VAT from high-fat diet-induced obese wild-type mice around the carotid artery of immunodeficient mice also promoted neointima formation, without affecting body weight or systemic leptin levels, and this effect was absent, if VAT from ob/ob mice was used. On the contrary, perivascular transplantation of VAT from ob/ob mice fed high-fat diet, characterized by marked immune cell accumulation, promoted neointimal hyperplasia also in the absence of leptin. In vitro, recombinant leptin and VAT-conditioned medium increased human arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation in a (partly) leptin-dependent manner.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that locally elevated leptin levels may promote neointima formation, independent of obesity and systemic hyperleptinemia, but also underline the importance of perivascular inflammation in mediating the increased cardiovascular risk in obesity.</p>

<p>We evaluated the use of a combination of human insulin gene-modified umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hUMSCs) with silk fibroin 3D scaffolds for adipose tissue engineering. In this study hUMSCs were isolated and cultured. HUMSCs infected with Ade-insulin-EGFP were seeded in fibroin 3D scaffolds with uniform 50-60<U+2009>µm pore size. Silk fibroin scaffolds with untransfected hUMSCs were used as control. They were cultured for 4<U+2009>days in adipogenic medium and transplanted under the dorsal skins of female Wistar rats after the hUMSCs had been labelled with chloromethylbenzamido-1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (CM-Dil). Macroscopical impression, fluorescence observation, histology and SEM were used for assessment after transplantation at 8 and 12<U+2009>weeks. Macroscopically, newly formed adipose tissue was observed in the experimental group and control group after 8 and 12<U+2009>weeks. Fluorescence observation supported that the formed adipose tissue originated from seeded hUMSCs rather than from possible infiltrating perivascular tissue. Oil red O staining of newly formed tissue showed that there was substantially more tissue regeneration in the experimental group than in the control group. SEM showed that experimental group cells had more fat-like cells, whose volume was larger than that of the control group, and degradation of the silk fibroin scaffold was greater under SEM observation. This study provides significant evidence that hUMSCs transfected by adenovirus vector have good compatibility with silk fibroin scaffold, and adenoviral transfection of the human insulin gene can be used for the construction of tissue-engineered adipose.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases adipocyte-derived hyperpolarizing factors (ADHFs) that may partly act by opening myocyte K(+) channels. The present study in rat and mouse mesenteric arteries aimed to identify the myocyte K(+) channel activated by PVAT and to determine whether adiponectin contributed to the hyperpolarizing effects of PVAT.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Myocyte membrane potential was recorded from de-endothelialized, non-contracted rat and mouse mesenteric arteries in the presence and absence of PVAT.KEY RESULTS: The ß3 -adrenoceptor agonist, CL-316,243 (10<U+2009>µM), generated PVAT-dependent, iberiotoxin-sensitive myocyte hyperpolarizations resulting from BKCa channel opening and which were partially blocked by L-NMMA (100<U+2009>µM). Adiponectin (5<U+2009>µg·mL(-1) ) also produced iberiotoxin-sensitive hyperpolarizations in PVAT-denuded arterioles. Activation of myocyte AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) using 5<U+2009>µM A-769662 also induced BKCa -mediated hyperpolarizations. Dorsomorphin abolished hyperpolarizations to CL-316,243, adiponectin and A-769662. In vessels from Adipo(-/-) mice, hyperpolarizations to CL-316,243 were absent whereas those to A-769662 and adiponectin were normal. In rat vessels, adipocyte-dependent hyperpolarizations were blocked by glibenclamide and clotrimazole but those to NS1619 (33<U+2009>µM) were unaltered.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Under basal, non-contracted conditions, ß3 -adrenoceptor stimulation of PVAT releases an ADHF, which is probably adiponectin. This activates AMPK to open myocyte BKCa channels indirectly and additionally liberates NO, which also contributes to the observed PVAT-dependent myocyte hyperpolarizations. Clotrimazole and glibenclamide each reversed hyperpolarizations to adiponectin and A-769662, suggesting the involvement of myocyte TRPM4 channels in the ADHF-induced myocyte electrical changes mediated via the opening of BKCa channels.</p>

<p>In all mammals, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are found together in several fat depots, forming a multi-depot organ. Adrenergic stimulation induces an increase in BAT usually referred to as “browning”. This phenomenon is important because of its potential use in curbing obesity and related disorders; thus, understanding its cellular mechanisms in humans may be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Data in rodents have supported the direct transformation of white into brown adipocytes. Biopsies of pure white omental fat were collected from 12 patients affected by the catecholamine-secreting tumor pheochromocytoma (pheo-patients) and compared with biopsies from controls. Half of the omental fat samples from pheo-patients contained uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-immunoreactive-(ir) multilocular cells that were often arranged in a BAT-like pattern endowed with noradrenergic fibers and dense capillary network. Many UCP1-ir adipocytes showed the characteristic morphology of paucilocular cells, which we have been described as cytological marker of transdifferentiation. Electron microscopy showed increased mitochondrial density in multi- and paucilocular cells and disclosed the presence of perivascular brown adipocyte precursors. Brown fat genes, such as UCP1, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and ß3-adrenoreceptor, were highly expressed in the omentum of pheo-patients and in those cases without visible morphologic re-arrangement. Of note, the brown determinant PRDM16 was detected by immunohistochemistry only in nuclei of multi- and paucilocular adipocytes. Quantitative electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Ki67 suggest an unlikely contribution of proliferative events to the phenomenon. The data support the idea that, in adult humans, white adipocytes of pure white fat that are subjected to adrenergic stimulation are able to undergo a process of direct transformation into brown adipocytes.

<p>BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is the basic and original sign of atherogenesis. Some evidences show that C-reactive protein (CRP) and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) play a pivotal role in atherosclerosis. However, the effects of CRP on atherosclerosis and the related mechanisms require elucidation.METHODS: The levels of basic total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, CRP, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were respectively measured in rabbits, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation function was also evaluated. Animals were randomly divided into two groups: PVAT(-) and PVAT(+) group (removing or keeping pericarotid adipose tissue (PCAT)). Both of the two groups were exposed to a high-fat diet for six-week, and then sustained CRP treatment was performed for a week, at this time point all the above parameters were remeasured. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of TNF-a, IL-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were respectively evaluated by Polymerase Chain Reaction and immunoblotting in PCAT and cultured adipocytes treated by CRP.RESULTS: High-fat diet greatly increased the serum lipids and inflammatory markers, induced endothelial dysfunction and imbalance between NO and ET-1, increased mRNA and protein expression of TNF-a, IL-6, MCP-1 and enhanced macrophage infiltration of PCAT. CRP treatment could further promote macrophage infiltration of PVAT, induce the imbalance between NO and ET-1, aggravate endothelial dysfunction especially in PVAT(+) arteries, and could also enhance the above-mentioned mRNA and protein expression in PCAT and cultured adipocytes.CONCLUSIONS: CRP could significantly promote endothelial dysfunction in high-fat diet rabbits especially in PVAT(+) groups, which may be partly mediated by activating inflammatory reaction of adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Endothelial dysfunction associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease is characterized by changes in vasoregulation, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, inflammatory activation, and altered barrier function. These endothelial alterations contribute to excess cardiovascular disease in diabetes, but may also play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, especially type 2. The mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in diabetes differ between type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D): hyperglycemia contributes to endothelial dysfunction in all individuals with diabetes, whereas the causative mechanisms in T2D also include impaired insulin signaling in endothelial cells, dyslipidemia and altered secretion of bioactive substances (adipokines) by adipose tissue. The close association of so-called perivascular adipose tissue with arteries and arterioles facilitates the exposure of vascular endothelium to adipokines, particularly if inflammation activates the adipose tissue. Glucose and adipokines activate specific intracellular signaling pathways in endothelium, which in concert result in endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Here, we review the characteristics of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, the causative mechanisms involved and the role of endothelial dysfunction(s) in the pathogenesis of T2D. Finally, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of endothelial dysfunction in T2D.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: One potential mechanism through which obesity exerts adverse effects on the vascular system is by increasing aortic stiffness, a change known to be predictive of increased cardiovascular mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology that links obesity to aortic stiffening.APPROACH AND RESULTS: Obese (ob/ob) mice were used to examine physical, morphological, and molecular changes in the aorta in response to obesity. ob/ob mice had increased aortic pulse wave velocity and tissue rigidity. ob/ob aorta exhibited decreases of lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity and cross-linked elastin, and increases of elastin fragmentation and elastolytic activity. The aortas of ob/ob mice were surrounded by a significant amount of proinflammatory and pro-oxidative perivascular adipose tissue. In vitro studies revealed that the conditioned medium from differentiated adipocytes or the perivascular adipose tissue of ob/ob mice attenuated LOX activity. Furthermore, inhibition of LOX in wild-type lean mice caused elastin fragmentation and induced a significant increase in pulse wave velocity. Finally, we found that obese humans had stiffer arteries and lower serum LOX levels than do normal-weight humans.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that obesity resulted in aortic stiffening in both humans and mice, and established a causal relationship between LOX downregulation and aortic stiffening in obesity.</p>

<p>Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) emerge and develop adjacent to blood vessel walls in the yolk sac, aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, embryonic liver, and fetal bone marrow. In adult mouse bone marrow, perivascular cells shape a “niche” for HSPCs. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), which support hematopoiesis in culture, are themselves derived in part from perivascular cells. In order to define their direct role in hematopoiesis, we tested the ability of purified human CD146(+) perivascular cells, as compared with unfractionated MSCs and CD146(-) cells, to sustain human HSPCs in coculture. CD146(+) perivascular cells support the long-term persistence, through cell-to-cell contact and at least partly via Notch activation, of human myelolymphoid HSPCs able to engraft primary and secondary immunodeficient mice. Conversely, unfractionated MSCs and CD146(-) cells induce differentiation and compromise ex vivo maintenance of HSPCs. Moreover, CD146(+) perivascular cells express, natively and in culture, molecular markers of the vascular hematopoietic niche. Unexpectedly, this dramatic, previously undocumented ability to support hematopoietic stem cells is present in CD146(+) perivascular cells extracted from the nonhematopoietic adipose tissue.</p>

<p>An ideal mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) source for bone tissue engineering has yet to be identified. Such an MSC population would be easily harvested in abundance, with minimal morbidity and with high purity. Our laboratories have identified perivascular stem cells (PSCs) as a candidate cell source. PSCs are readily isolatable through fluorescent-activated cell sorting from adipose tissue and have been previously shown to be indistinguishable from MSCs in the phenotype and differentiation potential. PSCs consist of two distinct cell populations: (1) pericytes (CD146+, CD34-, and CD45-), which surround capillaries and microvessels, and (2) adventitial cells (CD146-, CD34+, and CD45-), found within the tunica adventitia of large arteries and veins. We previously demonstrated the osteogenic potential of pericytes by examining pericytes derived from the human fetal pancreas, and illustrated their in vivo trophic and angiogenic effects. In the present study, we used an intramuscular ectopic bone model to develop the translational potential of our original findings using PSCs (as a combination of pericytes and adventitial cells) from human white adipose tissue. We evaluated human PSC (hPSC)-mediated bone formation and vascularization in vivo. We also examined the effects of hPSCs when combined with the novel craniosynostosis-associated protein, Nel-like molecule I (NELL-1). Implants consisting of the demineralized bone matrix putty combined with NELL-1 (3<U+2009>µg/µL), hPSC (2.5×10(5) cells), or hPSC+NELL-1, were inserted in the bicep femoris of SCID mice. Bone growth was evaluated using microcomputed tomography, histology, and immunohistochemistry over 4 weeks. Results demonstrated the osteogenic potential of hPSCs and the additive effect of hPSC+NELL-1 on bone formation and vasculogenesis. Comparable osteogenesis was observed with NELL-1 as compared to the more commonly used bone morphogenetic protein-2. Next, hPSCs induced greater implant vascularization than the unsorted stromal vascular fraction from patient-matched samples. Finally, we observed an additive effect on implant vascularization with hPSC+NELL-1 by histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry, accompanied by in vitro elaboration of vasculogenic growth factors. These findings hold significant implications for the cell/protein combination therapy hPSC+NELL-1 in the development of strategies for vascularized bone regeneration.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is implicated as a source of proatherogenic cytokines. Phenotypic differences in local PVAT depots may contribute to differences in disease susceptibility among arteries and even regions within an artery. It has been proposed that PVAT around the abdominal and thoracic aorta shares characteristics of white and brown adipose tissue (BAT), respectively; however, a detailed comparison of the phenotype of these PVAT depots has not been performed. Using young and older adult rats, we compared the phenotype of PVATs surrounding the abdominal and thoracic aorta to each other and also to epididymal white and subscapular BAT. Compared with young rats, older rats exhibited greater percent body fat (34.5 ± 3.1 vs. 10.4 ± 0.9%), total cholesterol (112.2 ± 7.5 vs. 58.7 ± 6.3 mg/dl), HOMA-insulin resistance (1.7 ± 0.1 vs. 0.9 ± 0.1 a.u.), as well as reduced ACh-induced relaxation of the aorta (maximal relaxation: 54 ± 10 vs. 77 ± 6%) (all P &lt; 0.05). Expression of inflammatory genes and markers of immune cell infiltration were greater in abdominal PVAT than in thoracic PVAT, and overall, abdominal and thoracic PVATs resembled the phenotype of white adipose tissue (WAT) and BAT, respectively. Histology and electron microscopy indicated structural similarity between visceral WAT and abdominal PVAT and between BAT and thoracic PVAT. Our data provide evidence that abdominal PVAT is more inflamed than thoracic PVAT, a difference that was by and large independent of sedentary aging. Phenotypic differences in PVAT between regions of the aorta may be relevant in light of the evidence in large animals and humans that the abdominal aorta is more vulnerable to atherosclerosis than the thoracic aorta.</p>

<p>Acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and coenzyme A, and have the potential to regulate the intracellular levels of these molecules. In this study, we show that a cytosolic isoform, Acot1, is expressed and distributed in immature adipocytes located in the perivascular region of the white adipose tissue (WAT) of rats. Immunoblot analyses detected Acot1 in all of the WATs examined, while immunohistochemistry revealed positively stained layered structures surrounding the adventitia of blood vessels in the subcutaneous WAT. When the subcutaneous WAT was digested with collagenase and centrifuged, Acot1 was recovered in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), and not in the large mature adipocytes. In the SVF, undigested cells attached to short tubular fragments of blood vessels showed positive immunostaining, as well as a proportion of the dispersed cells. These fibroblast-like cells contained fine particulate lipid droplets, stained by oil-red O dye, in their cytoplasm, or expressed fatty acid-binding protein 4, an adipocyte marker. After induction of adipocyte differentiation following a 15-day preculture without insulin, the dedifferentiated cells showed increased Acot1 expression with a diffuse distribution throughout the cytosol. These findings suggest that Acot1 expression is transiently upregulated at an early stage of adipocyte maturation, possibly to maintain cytosolic acyl-CoAs below a certain level until the cells acquire their full capability for fat storage.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is a heterogeneous organ with remarkable variations in fat cell metabolism depending on the anatomical location. However, the pattern and distribution of bioactive lipid mediators between different fat depots and their relationships in complex diseases have not been investigated. Using LC-MS/MS-based metabolo-lipidomics, here we report that human subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissues possess a range of specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) including resolvin (Rv) D1, RvD2, protectin (PD) 1, lipoxin (LX) A4, and the monohydroxy biosynthetic pathway markers of RvD1 and PD1 (17-HDHA), RvE1 (18-HEPE), and maresin 1 (14-HDHA). The “classic” eicosanoids prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGD2, PGF2a, leukotriene (LT) B4, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), 12-HETE, and 15-HETE were also identified in SC fat. SC fat from patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) exhibited a marked deficit in PD1 and 17-HDHA levels. Compared with SC, perivascular adipose tissue displayed higher SPM levels, suggesting an enhanced resolution capacity in this fat depot. In addition, augmented levels of eicosanoids and SPM were observed in SC fat surrounding foot wounds. Notably, the profile of SC PGF2a differed significantly when patients were grouped by body mass index (BMI). In the case of peri-wound SC fat, BMI negatively correlated with PGE2. In this tissue, proresolving mediators RvD2 and LXA4 were identified in lower levels than the proinflammatory LTB4. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a diverse distribution of bioactive lipid mediators depending on the localization of human fat depots and uncover a specific SPM pattern closely associated with PVD.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The discovery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or MSC-like cells in cartilage tissue does not tie in well with the established view that MSCs derive from a perivascular niche. The presence of MSCs may raise concerns about specificity and application safety, particularly in terms of the regulatory site. The aim of the present study was to investigate the benefits or possible risks of the MSC-like properties of cells isolated from cartilage in the context of autologous chondrocyte implantation.METHODS: Chondrocytic cells were isolated from cartilage or intervertebral disc tissue. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the expression of cell surface antigens. MSC-like cells were either enriched or depleted by means of magnetic cell sorting (MACS) involving the monoclonal antibodies W5C5/SUSD2 and W8B2/MSCA-1. We addressed the issues of prolonged expansion of such cells as well as the influence of culture medium as a trigger for selecting a single cell type. Established protocols were used to study in vitro differentiation. In addition to histological and biochemical assessment, the acquired phenotypes were also evaluated on the mRNA transcript level.RESULTS: In the studied cells, we found strongly analogous expression of antigens typically expressed on MSCs, including CD49e, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD140b and CD166. The expression of W5C5 and W8B2 antigens in cartilage cell sub-populations did not correlate with multi-potency. We demonstrated that a chondroid precursor, but not a bona fide multipotent mesenchymal, cell type can be obtained under established in vitro culture conditions. The culture media used for expansion influenced the cell phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: The risk of adverse adipose or osseous differentiation is not posed by expanded chondrocyte cultures, even after enrichment of putative MSC-like cell populations by MACS. It is possible that this limited “stemness” in chondrocytes, expanded for use in ACI, may instead be beneficial as it allows re-differentiation under appropriate conditions despite prolonged times in culture.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that human perivascular and subcutaneous adipose tissues hold distinct phenotypic signatures. We also evaluated the impact of clinical parameters on the adipose phenotype. Our overall goal is to understand the determinants of adipose biology so that this tissue can be manipulated therapeutically to lessen peripheral vascular disease.METHODS: Perivascular and subcutaneous adipose tissues were collected from patients undergoing lower-extremity amputation (n = 27) and protein assayed for proinflammatory mediators (ie, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, leptin, tumor necrosis factor a, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and resistin), atheroprotective adiponectin, and the fibrinolysis inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.RESULTS: Leptin (2.7-fold, P = .015), TNF-a (2.2-fold, P = .013), MCP-1 (1.5-fold, P = .047), and adiponectin (1.8-fold, P = .004) were more abundant in subcutaneous vs perivascular adipose tissue. Age positively correlated with perivascular adipose tissue PAI-1 expression (ß = .64, P = .042), and hyperlipidemia negatively correlated with perivascular adiponectin (ß = -1.18, P = .039).CONCLUSIONS: Human perivascular and subcutaneous adipose tissues hold distinct phenotypic signatures. In amputation patients, the subcutaneous adipose tissue proinflammatory phenotype was relatively attenuated in perivascular adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Much attention is currently focused on the role of perivascular adipose tissue in development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Some researchers view it as promoting CVD through secretion of cytokines and growth factors called adipokines, while recent reports reveal that perivascular adipose tissue can exert a protective effect on CVD development. Furthermore, adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, reportedly suppresses neointimal hyperplasia after endovascular injury, whereas such vascular remodeling is enhanced by pro-inflammatory adipokines secreted by perivascular adipose, such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). These findings suggest that extent of vascular remodeling, a pathological process associated with CVD development, depends on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines secreted from perivascular adipose tissue. We previously demonstrated that angiopoietin-like protein 2 (Angptl2), a pro-inflammatory factor secreted by adipose tissue, promotes adipose tissue inflammation and subsequent systemic insulin resistance in obesity. Here, we examined whether Angptl2 secreted by perivascular adipose tissue contributes to vascular remodeling after endovascular injury in studies of transgenic mice expressing Angptl2 in adipose tissue (aP2-Angptl2 transgenic mice) and Angptl2 knockout mice (Angptl2(-/-) mice). To assess the role of Angptl2 secreted by perivascular adipose tissue on vascular remodeling after endovascular injury, we performed adipose tissue transplantation experiments using these mice. Wild-type mice with perivascular adipose tissue derived from aP2-Angptl2 mice exhibited accelerated neointimal hyperplasia after endovascular injury compared to wild-type mice transplanted with wild-type tissue. Conversely, vascular inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia after endovascular injury were significantly attenuated in wild-type mice transplanted with Angptl2(-/-) mouse-derived perivascular adipose tissue compared to wild-type mice transplanted with wild-type tissue. RT-PCR analysis revealed that mouse Angptl2 expression in perivascular adipose tissue was significantly increased by aging, hypercholesterolemia, and endovascular injury, all risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analysis of tissues from patients with CHD and from non-CHD patients indicated that ANGPTL2 expression in epicardial adipose tissue was unchanged. Interestingly, that analysis also revealed a positive correlation in ANGPTL2 and ADIPONECTIN expression in epicardial adipose tissue of non-CHD patients, a correlation not seen in CHD patients. However, in epicardial adipose tissue from CHD patients, ANGPTL2 expression was positively correlated with that of TNF-a, a correlation was not seen in non-CHD patients. These findings suggest that pro-inflammatory adipokines cooperatively accelerate CHD development and that maintaining a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines likely protects non-CHD patients from developing CHD. Overall, our studies demonstrate that perivascular adipose tissue-secreted Angptl2 accelerates vascular inflammation and the subsequent CVD development.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived adult stem cells (ASCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bmMSCs), and human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs) tissue have been widely tested for regenerative applications, such as bone regeneration. Moreover, olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) show promise in promoting spinal cord injury (SCI) regeneration. Our group recently proposed the use of a hybrid scaffold targeting both vertebral bone repair and SCI regeneration. According to this concept, both MSCs and OECs should be in close contact to be influenced by the factors that are involved in secretion. For this reason, here we studied the effects of the OEC secretome on the metabolic activity and proliferation of ASCs, bmMSCs, and HUCPVCs. The stem cells’ secretome effects on metabolic activity and proliferation of the OECs were also considered. In co-cultures of OECs with ASCs, bmMSCs, or HUCPVCs, the metabolic activity/viability, proliferation, and total cell numbers were measured after 2 and 7 days of culture. The results demonstrated that the secretome of OECs has a positive effect on the metabolic activity and proliferation of MSCs from different origins, especially on ASCs. Furthermore, in general, the stem cells’ secretome also had a positive effect on the OECs behavior, particularly when ASCs were in co-culture with OECs. These results suggest that the most suitable combination of cells to be used in our hybrid scaffold is the OECs with the ASCs. Finally, this work adds new knowledge to the cell therapy field, bringing new information about paracrine interactions between OECs and distinct mesenchymal stems.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (TAT) is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and may play a role in obesity-mediated vascular disease. We sought to determine the prevalence, distribution, and risk factor correlates of high TAT.METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants from the Framingham Heart Study (n=3246, 48% women, mean age 51.1 years) underwent multidetector computed tomography; high TAT and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were defined on the basis of sex-specific 90th percentiles in a healthy referent sample. The prevalence of high TAT was 38.1% in women and 35.7% in men. Among individuals without high VAT, 10.1% had high TAT. After adjustment for age and VAT, both women and men with high TAT in the absence of high VAT were older and had a higher prevalence of CVD (P&lt;0.0001) compared with those without high TAT. In addition, men in this group were more likely to be smokers (P=0.02), whereas women were more likely to have low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.005).CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in our community-based sample with high TAT in the absence of high VAT were characterized by an adverse cardiometabolic profile. This adipose tissue phenotype may identify a subset of individuals with distinct metabolic characteristics.</p>

<p>VEGF is one the pro-inflammatory adipokines synthesized by the “adipose secretoma” of obese subjects as a response to hypoxic conditions; but the main function of VEGF is angiogenesis, being recognized as the most important factor increasing blood capillaries in the adipose tissue by stimulating endothelial cell growth. In this paper, we propose a comparative study of the vascular response to VEGF synthesis in the subcutaneous and central-peritoneal adipose depots in lean, obese and obese diabetic patients. We used CD31 to label the endothelial cells in order to evaluate the response of the vascular network to VEGF synthesis. Our results showed an increase of VEGF protein synthesis in obese and obese-diabetic patients compared to lean subjects where the protein was absent. The positivity for VEGF in obese diabetic samples was observed in numerous structures from the adipose depots, both in the stromal vascular fraction–blood vessels and stromal cells–as well as in the cytoplasm of adipocytes. Positivity in the vascular wall was observed more frequently in areas of perivascular and intralobular fibrosis. Obese and diabetic patients showed similar incidence of CD31 immunoreactivity with lean subjects in both subcutaneous and peritoneal depots. In conclusion, human adipose depots show a different incidence of VEGF positive cells in relation with their disposal and the metabolic status. VEGF synthesis in visceral adipose tissue is inefficient being not followed by angiogenesis to counterbalance tissue hypoxia. We suggest that may be a pathogenic link between the degrees of intralobular fibrosis in adipose depots and VEGF expression.</p>

<p>This study aims to identify the potential mechanisms by which perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) reduces tone in small arteries. Small mesenteric arteries from wild-type and large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BKCa) channel knockout mice were mounted on a wire myograph in the presence and absence of PVAT, and contractile responses to norepinephrine were assessed. Electrophysiology studies were performed in isolated vessels to measure changes in membrane potential produced by adiponectin. Contractile responses from wild-type mouse small arteries were significantly reduced in the presence of PVAT. This was not observed in the presence of a BKCa channel inhibitor or with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition or in BKCa or adiponectin knockout mice. Solution transfer experiments demonstrated the presence of an anticontractile factor released from PVAT. Adiponectin-induced vasorelaxation and hyperpolarization in wild-type arteries were not evident in the absence of or after inhibition of BKCa channels. PVAT from BKCa or adiponectin knockout mice failed to elicit an anticontractile response in wild-type arteries. PVAT releases adiponectin, which is an anticontractile factor. Its effect on vascular tone is mediated by activation of BKCa channels on vascular smooth muscle cells and adipocytes and by endothelial mechanisms.</p>

<p>There is a close anatomical and functional relationship between adipose tissue and blood vessels. The crosstalk between these two organs is vital to both metabolic and vascular homeostasis. On the one hand, adipose tissue is highly vascularized, and maintenance of ample supply of blood flow is essential for both expansion and metabolic functions of adipose tissue. Vascular endothelium also secretes many factors to regulate adipogenesis and adipose tissue remodeling. On the other hand, almost all blood vessels are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which regulates vascular function by producing a large number of “vasocrine” molecules. Under the normal conditions, PVAT exerts its anti-contractile effects by release of vasorelaxants (such as adipocyte-derived relaxation factors and adiponectin) that promote both endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations of blood vessels. However, PVAT in obesity becomes highly inflamed and induces vascular dysfunction by augmented secretion of vasoconstriction factors (such as the major components of renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone system and superoxide) and pro-inflammatory adipokines (such as TNF-a and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein), the latter of which are important contributors to endothelial activation, vascular inflammation and neointimal formation. Furthermore, several adipocyte-derived adipokines impair vascular function indirectly, by acting in the brain to activate sympathetic nerve system (such as leptin) or by exerting their actions in major metabolic organs to induce vascular insulin resistance, which in turn aggravates endothelial dysfunction. Aberrant secretion of adipokines and other vasoactive factors in adipose tissue is a major contributor to the onset and progression of obesity-related metabolic and vascular complications.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AIMS: Adipose tissue represents a practical source of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and vascular-endothelial progenitor cells, available for regenerative therapy without in vitro expansion. One of the problems confronting the therapeutic application of such cells is how to immobilize them at the wound site. We evaluated in vitro the growth and differentiation of human adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells after delivery through the use of a fibrin spray system.METHODS: SVF cells were harvested from four human adult patients undergoing elective abdominoplasty, through the use of the LipiVage system. After collagenase digestion, mesenchymal and endothelial progenitor cells (pericytes, supra-adventitial stromal cells, endothelial progenitors) were quantified by flow cytometry before culture. SVF cells were applied to culture vessels by means of the Tisseel fibrin spray system. SVF cell growth and differentiation were documented by immunofluorescence staining and photomicrography.RESULTS: SVF cells remained viable after application and were expanded up to 3 weeks, when they reached confluence and adipogenic differentiation. Under angiogenic conditions, SVF cells formed endothelial (vWF+, CD31+ and CD34+) tubules surrounded by CD146+ and a-smooth muscle actin+ perivascular/stromal cells.CONCLUSIONS: Human adipose tissue is a rich source of autologous stem cells, which are readily available for regenerative applications such as wound healing, without in vitro expansion. Our results indicate that mesenchymal and endothelial progenitor cells, prepared in a closed system from unpassaged lipoaspirate samples, retain their growth and differentiation capacity when applied and immobilized on a substrate using a clinically approved fibrin sealant spray system.</p>

<p>AIMS: Vascular peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <U+03B3> (PPAR<U+03B3>) activation improves vascular remodelling and endothelial function in hypertensive rodents. The goal of this study was to determine that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) PPAR<U+03B3> exerts a vascular protective role beyond its metabolic effects.METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated a model of adult inducible VSMC-specific Ppar<U+03B3> inactivation to test the hypothesis that PPAR<U+03B3> counteracts angiotensin (Ang) II-induced vascular remodelling and endothelial dysfunction. Inducible VSMC Ppar<U+03B3> knockout mice were generated by crossing Ppar<U+03B3> floxed mice with mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase Smooth muscle (Sm) myosin heavy chain promoter control. Eight-to-ten-week-old SmPpar<U+03B3>(-/-) and control mice were infused with a nonpressor dose of Ang II for 7 days. Blood pressure was unaffected. Mesenteric arteries showed eutrophic remodelling in Ang II-infused control mice and hypertrophic remodelling in Ang II-infused SmPpar<U+03B3>(-/-) mice. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was reduced in SmPpar<U+03B3>(-/-) mice and further impaired by Ang II infusion, and was unaffected by an inhibitor of NO synthase, suggesting a defect of NO-mediated relaxation. SmPpar<U+03B3> deletion increased the sensitivity to Ang II-induced contraction. SmPpar<U+03B3>(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced Ang II-induced vascular NADPH oxidase activity and adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression. The antioxidant Superoxide dismutase 3 expression was decreased by SmPpar<U+03B3> deletion. Ang II infusion increased the expression of CD3 T-cell co-receptor chain d and decreased Adiponectin in perivascular adipose tissue of SmPpar<U+03B3>(-/-) mice.CONCLUSION: Inducible Ppar<U+03B3> inactivation in VSMCs exacerbated Ang II-induced vascular remodelling and endothelial dysfunction via enhanced vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, revealing the protective role of VSMC PPAR<U+03B3> in angiotensin II-induced vascular injury.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: It is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of the physiological framework of the pelvic organ support system to develop more effective interventions. Developing more successful interventions for restoration of defects of the pelvic floor will lead to symptomatic improvement of pelvic floor prolapse and stress incontinence disorders. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the physiological framework related to the pelvic organ support system and propose the underlying mechanisms of pelvic organ support based on the anatomical findings.STUDY DESIGN: Ten female soft embalmed cadavers were dissected after a colorectal hands-on workshop to visualize components of the pelvic organ support system.RESULTS: The puborectalis attached at the superior pubic ramus above the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis. The anterior half of the iliococcygeus originated at the level of the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis but descended from the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis before it reached the ischial spine. The fibrous visceral sheath of the endopelvic fascia covered both the bladder and the upper vagina and bound these structures together. The levator ani muscle was separated into a horizontal and a vertical part at the medial attachment of the fibrous visceral sheath. A well-circumscribed adipose cushion pillow, in the ischioanal fossa and its anterior recess, supported the horizontal part of the levator ani muscle and pressed the vertical part against the pelvic viscera. Perivascular sheaths and pelvic nerve plexuses were reinforced by condensed endopelvic fascia, they suspended the pelvic organs posterolaterally.CONCLUSION: The pelvic organ support framework consists of two mechanical structures: (1) the supporting system of the levator ani muscle, the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis and the adipose cushion pillow, and (2) the suspension system of the neurovascular structures and the associated endopelvic fascia condensation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the quantitative diagnosis value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for early-stage liver cirrhosis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 15 healthy subjects and 15 patients with cirrhosis were recruited into the present study, and the hepatic artery, portal vein, hepatic vein and liver parenchyma were dynamically monitored under ultrasonography and then qualified with the QLAB time-intensity curve to obtain the arriving time (AT) and the peak time (PT) of the hepatic artery, portal vein, hepatic vein and liver parenchyma. The hepatic artery to hepatic vein transit time (HA-HVTT = HVAT-HAAT) and portal vein to hepatic vein transit time (PV-HVTT = HVAT-PVAT) were calculated.RESULTS: The AT of the hepatic vein was significantly shorter than that in controls (P &lt; 0.01); the HA-HVTT and PV-HVTT in cirrhosis patients were also significantly shorter than those in controls (P &lt; 0.01). However, the PT in patients was significantly prolonged when compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The AT of the hepatic vein, the transit time of the liver and the PT of liver parenchyma can be used as non-invasive indicators in the quantitative diagnosis of early-stage liver cirrhosis.</p>

<p>Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many common diseases, like atherosclerosis and hypertension. The key role of the interaction between oxidative stress and inflammation in causal mechanisms of these diseases is widely accepted. Until recently, perivascular adipose tissue was not taken into account while looking at mechanisms of these disorders. However, it has recently been demonstrated that most processes involved in endothelial dysfunction development are taking place in this tissue. Adipocytes are an important source of free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These molecules lead to further enhancement of oxidative stress, through uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and production of peroxynitrite radical instead of nitric oxide which further disrupts eNOS function. In addition, macrophages and T lymphocytes infiltrate adipose tissue as a result of chemotactic proteins release, upon oxidative stress activation, which further enhances inflammation. Thus, the chronic inflammation, which develops in this compartment of adipose tissue in patients with obesity, is the first step in the development of atherosclerotic plaque or hypertension. That is why comprehensive understanding of ongoing processes within perivascular adipocytes is so important.</p>

<p>Obesity in the elderly individuals is increasing at alarming rates and there is evidence suggesting that elderly individuals are more vulnerable to the deleterious cardiovascular effects of obesity than younger individuals. However, the specific mechanisms through which aging and obesity interact to promote the development of cardiovascular disease remain unclear. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that aging exacerbates obesity-induced inflammation in perivascular adipose tissue, which contributes to increased vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in a paracrine manner. To test this hypothesis, we assessed changes in the secretome, reactive oxygen species production, and macrophage infiltration in periaortic adipose tissue of young (7 month old) and aged (24 month old) high-fat diet-fed obese C57BL/6 mice. High-fat diet-induced vascular reactive oxygen species generation significantly increased in aged mice, which was associated with exacerbation of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. In young animals, high-fat diet-induced obesity promoted oxidative stress in the perivascular adipose tissue, which was associated with a marked proinflammatory shift in the profile of secreted cytokines and chemokines. Aging exacerbated obesity-induced oxidative stress and inflammation and significantly increased macrophage infiltration in periaortic adipose tissue. Using cultured arteries isolated from young control mice, we found that inflammatory factors secreted from the perivascular fat tissue of obese aged mice promote significant prooxidative and proinflammatory phenotypic alterations in the vascular wall, mimicking the aging phenotype. Overall, our findings support an important role for localized perivascular adipose tissue inflammation in exacerbation of vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in aging, an effect that likely enhances the risk for development of cardiovascular diseases from obesity in the elderly individuals.</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome is a worldwide healthcare issue and a dominant risk factor for the development of incurable diseases that affect the entire body. The hepatic manifestations of this syndrome include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive variant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The basic pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH remains controversial because it is difficult to clarify the disease process of NASH on the basis of metabolic syndrome alone. To determine the pathogenesis and effective treatment, an excellent animal model of NASH is required. Tsumura Suzuki obese diabetes (TSOD) male mice spontaneously develop diabetes mellitus, obesity, glucosuria, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia without any special treatments such as gene manipulation. In this study, we examined the histopathological characteristics of visceral fat and liver of 56 male TSOD mice aged 4-17 months and 9 male Tsumura Suzuki non-obesity (control) mice aged 6-12 months. In the visceral fat, enlargement of adipocytes and perivascular and pericapsular CD8-positive lymphoid aggregation were observed in 4-month-old mice. Abnormal expression of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and lipid peroxidation endo products was observed in macrophages. In the liver, microvesicular steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, and Mallory bodies were observed in 4-month-old mice, with severity worsening with increasing time. These pathological findings in the liver mimic those seen in patients with NASH. Interestingly, small liver nodules with high cellularity and absence of portal tracts were frequently observed after 12 months. Most of them showed nuclear and structural atypia, and mimicked human hepatocellular carcinoma. The degree of steatosis in the non-tumor portions of the liver improved when the liver nodules developed. These findings were not observed in control mice. Here, we report that TSOD male mice spontaneously developed NAFLD without any special treatment, and that these mice are a valuable model for assessing NASH and NASH carcinogenesis owing to metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is the fat tissue surrounding most of the vasculature and it has long been considered solely as vessel-supporting connective tissue. There are 2 major types of adipose tissue widely distributed throughout the body: white (WAT) and brown (BAT). PVAT is similar to BAT in rodents, but it was believed that only WAT existed in adult humans and BAT was present only in infants. However, the presence of functional BAT in adult humans is now accepted. The main function of BAT is to generate heat, and it is essential for adaptive thermogenesis and energy expenditure, whereas the main function of WAT is to store lipids. Besides the different functions of WAT and BAT, growing evidence suggests that different depots of adipose tissue have different functions. Similar to other fat depots, PVAT produces various adipokines, growth factors and inhibitors that affect functions of adjacent layers of the vasculature. Pathophysiological conditions such as obesity, vascular injury, aging and infection could cause PVAT dysfunction, leading to vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell dysfunctions. In this review, we discuss the function and dysfunction of PVAT on atherosclerosis and hypertension.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is an ideal mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) source, as it is dispensable and accessible with minimal morbidity. However, the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue is a heterogeneous cell population, which has disadvantages for tissue regeneration. In the present study, we prospectively purified human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) from n = 60 samples of human lipoaspirate and documented their frequency, viability, and variation with patient demographics. PSCs are a fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted population composed of pericytes (CD45-, CD146+, CD34-) and adventitial cells (CD45-, CD146-, CD34+), each of which we have previously reported to have properties of MSCs. Here, we found that PSCs make up, on average, 43.2% of SVF from human lipoaspirate (19.5% pericytes and 23.8% adventitial cells). These numbers were minimally changed by age, gender, or body mass index of the patient or by length of refrigerated storage time between liposuction and processing. In a previous publication, we observed that human PSCs (hPSCs) formed significantly more bone in vivo in comparison with unsorted human SVF (hSVF) in an intramuscular implantation model. We now extend this finding to a bone injury model, observing that purified hPSCs led to significantly greater healing of mouse critical-size calvarial defects than hSVF (60.9% healing as opposed to 15.4% healing at 2 weeks postoperative by microcomputed tomography analysis). These studies suggest that adipose-derived hPSCs are a new cell source for future efforts in skeletal regenerative medicine. Moreover, hPSCs are a stem cell-based therapeutic that is readily approvable by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with potentially increased safety, purity, identity, potency, and efficacy.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is an ideal source of mesenchymal stem cells for bone tissue engineering: it is largely dispensable and readily accessible with minimal morbidity. However, the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue is a heterogeneous cell population, which leads to unreliable bone formation. In the present study, we prospectively purified human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) from adipose tissue and compared their bone-forming capacity with that of traditionally derived SVF. PSCs are a population (sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting) of pericytes (CD146+CD34-CD45-) and adventitial cells (CD146-CD34+CD45-), each of which we have previously reported to have properties of mesenchymal stem cells. Here, we found that PSCs underwent osteogenic differentiation in vitro and formed bone after intramuscular implantation without the need for predifferentiation. We next sought to optimize PSCs for in vivo bone formation, adopting a demineralized bone matrix for osteoinduction and tricalcium phosphate particle formulation for protein release. Patient-matched, purified PSCs formed significantly more bone in comparison with traditionally derived SVF by all parameters. Recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 2 increased in vivo bone formation but with a massive adipogenic response. In contrast, recombinant Nel-like molecule 1 (NELL-1; a novel osteoinductive growth factor) selectively enhanced bone formation. These studies suggest that adipose-derived human PSCs are a new cell source for future efforts in skeletal regenerative medicine. Moreover, PSCs are a stem cell-based therapeutic that is readily approvable by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with potentially increased safety, purity, identity, potency, and efficacy. Finally, NELL-1 is a candidate growth factor able to induce human PSC osteogenesis.</p>

<p>KCNQ channels have been identified in arterial smooth muscle. However, their role in vasoregulation and chronic vascular diseases remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that KCNQ channels contribute to periadventitial vasoregulation in peripheral skeletal muscle arteries by perivascular adipose tissue and that they represent novel targets to rescue periadventitial vascular dysfunction. Two models, spontaneously hypertensive rats and New Zealand obese mice, were studied using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the patch-clamp technique, membrane potential measurements, myography of isolated vessels, and blood pressure telemetry. In rat Gracilis muscle arteries, anticontractile effects of perivascular fat were inhibited by the KCNQ channel blockers XE991 and linopirdine but not by other selective K(+) channel inhibitors. Accordingly, XE991 and linopirdine blocked noninactivating K(+) currents in freshly isolated Gracilis artery smooth muscle cells. mRNAs of several KCNQ channel subtypes were detected in those arteries, with KCNQ4 channels being dominant. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, the anticontractile effect of perivascular fat in Gracilis muscle arteries was largely reduced compared with Wistar rats. However, the vasodilator effects of KCNQ channel openers and mRNA expression of KCNQ channels were normal. Furthermore, KCNQ channel openers restored the diminished anticontractile effects of perivascular fat in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Moreover, KCNQ channel openers reduced arterial blood pressure in both models of hypertension independent of ganglionic blockade. Thus, our data suggest that KCNQ channels play a pivotal role in periadventitial vasoregulation of peripheral skeletal muscle arteries, and KCNQ channel opening may be an effective mechanism to improve impaired periadventitial vasoregulation and associated hypertension.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue (AT) is composed of mature adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, including adipose stem/stromal cells (ASCs). We characterized hematopoietic cells residing in human nonobese AT by analyzing the SVF isolated from human lipoaspirates and peripheral blood (PB). Flow cytometry revealed that AT-resident hematopoietic cells consisted of AT-resident macrophages (ATMs) or lymphocytes with a negligible number of granulocytes. AT-resident lymphocytes were composed of helper T cells and natural killer cells. Almost no B cells and few cytotoxic T cells were observed in nonobese AT. More than 90% of ATMs were M2 state CD206(+) macrophages (CD45(+)/CD14(+)) that were located in the periendothelium or interstitial spaces between adipocytes. We also discovered a novel subpopulation of CD34(+)/CD206(+) ATMs (11.1% of CD206(+)ATMs) that localized in the perivascular region. Microarray of noncultured CD34(+)/CD206(+) ATMs, CD34(-)/CD206(+) ATMs, CD45(-)/CD31(-)/CD34(+) ASCs, and PB-derived circulating monocytes revealed that CD34(+)/CD206(+) ATMs shared characteristics with ASCs and circulating monocytes. Unlike CD34(-)/CD206(+) ATMs, CD34(+)/CD206(+) ATMs could grow in adherent culture and were capable of differentiating into multiple mesenchymal (adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic) lineages, similar to ASCs. CD34(+)/CD206(+) ATMs grew rapidly and lost expression of CD45, CD14, and CD206 by passage 3, which resulted in a similar expression profile to ASCs. Thus, this novel ATM subpopulation (CD45(+)/CD14(+)/CD34(+)/CD206(+)) showed distinct biological properties from other ATMs and circulating monocytes/macrophages. The CD34(+)/CD206(+) ATMs possessed characteristics similar to ASCs, including adherence, localization, morphology, and mesenchymal multipotency. This AT-resident subpopulation may have migrated from the bone marrow and may be important to tissue maintenance and remolding.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Innate immunity drives numerous cardiovascular pathologies. Vein bypass grafting procedures are frequently accompanied by low-grade wound contamination. We hypothesized that a peri-graft innate immune challenge, via an outside-in route, augments inflammatory responses, which subsequently drive a component of negative vein graft wall adaptations; moreover, adipose tissue mediates this immune response.METHODS: The inferior vena cava from a donor mouse was implanted into the common carotid artery of a recipient mouse utilizing a validated cuff technique (9-week-old male C57BL/6J mice). Slow-release low-dose (5 µg) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 9) was applied peri-graft; morphologic analysis was completed (day 28). In parallel, vein-grafted mice received peri-graft LPS (n = 12), distant subcutaneous LPS (n = 6), or vehicle (n = 12), then day-1 and -3 harvest of grafts and adipose tissue for cytokines and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling mRNA expression (qRT-PCR).RESULTS: All recipient mice survived, and all vein grafts were patent. Acute low-dose local LPS challenge enhanced vein graft lumen loss (P = .04) and tended to augment intimal hyperplasia (P = .06). The surgical trauma of vein grafting universally upregulated key pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators within the day-1 graft wall, but varied on TLR signaling gene expression. Local and distant LPS accentuated these patterns until at least postoperative day 3. LPS challenge enhanced the inflammatory response in adipose tissue (locally &gt; distantly); local LPS upregulated adipose TLR-4 dramatically.CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular and distant inflammatory challenges potentiate the magnitude and duration of inflammatory responses in the early vein graft wall, negatively modulating wall adaptations, and thus, potentially contribute to vein graft failure. Furthermore, surgery activates innate immunity in adipose tissue, which is augmented (regionally &gt; systemically) by LPS. Modulation of these local and distant inflammatory signaling networks stands as a potential strategy to enhance the durability of vascular interventions such as vein grafts.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been intensively studied for innovative therapeutic applications. MSC in vitro are characterized by plastic-adherent proliferation, their specific immunophenotype and multipotency, whereas MSC progenitors in vivo are described as perivascular cells. Whether MSC progenitors acquire in vitro MSC characteristics upon in vitro culture is still unclear. This question can be experimentally accessed by analyzing changes in cellular properties that occur during the early in vitro culture phase, the MSC derivation phase. Here, we examined dynamics in morphology, proliferation, and expression of surface markers used for MSC characterization (such as CD34, CD105, CD146, and CD271) in tight kinetics during the MSC derivation phase of adipose tissue-derived MSC (AT-MSC). Using multiparametric flow cytometry, we identified 3 major ex vivo stromal vascular cell subsets: CD34+ CD146-CD271(+/-) adventitial stromal cell-like cells (AdSC), CD34- CD146+ CD271(+/-) pericyte-like cells (PC), and CD34+ CD31+ CD146+ endothelial cells. Of these subsets, only AdSC, but not PC gave rise to MSC under MSC culture conditions. At day 4 of culture, AdSC became fibroblastoid and upregulated CD105, CD146, and CD271. Following this phenotypic transition, AdSC commenced proliferation and downregulated CD34. In our study, we demonstrate that AdSC are more clonogenic AT-MSC progenitors than PC. Moreover, we, for the first time have dissected the phenotypic transitions from MSC progenitors to in vitro MSC during the MSC derivation phase using multiparametric flow cytometry. Hence, we propose a model describing how de novo acquisition of the typical MSC morphology by AdSC is accompanied by concerted regulation of surface marker expression upon in vitro culture.</p>

<p>Epidemiologic studies associate cancer with obesity, but the pathophysiologic connections remain obscure. In this study, we show that obesity facilitates tumor growth in mice irrespective of concurrent diet, suggesting a direct effect of excess white adipose tissue (WAT). When transplanted into mice, adipose stromal cells (ASC) can serve as perivascular adipocyte progenitors that promote tumor growth, perhaps helping explain the obesity-cancer link. In developing this hypothesis, we showed that ASCs are expanded in obesity and that they traffic from endogenous WAT to tumors in several mouse models of cancer. Strikingly, a comparison of circulating and tumor-infiltrating cell populations in lean, and obese mice revealed that cancer induces a six-fold increase of ASC frequency in the systemic circulation. We obtained evidence that ASCs mobilized in this way can be recruited into tumors, where they can be incorporated into blood vessels as pericytes and they can differentiate into adipocytes in an obesity-dependent manner. Extending this evidence, we found that increased tumor vascularization (reflected by changes in tumor vascular morphology and a two-fold increase in vascular density) was associated with intratumoral adipocytes and elevated proliferation of neighboring malignant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ASCs recruited from endogenous adipose tissue can be recruited by tumors to potentiate the supportive properties of the tumor microenvironment.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been shown to produce vasoactive substances and regulate vascular tone. This function of PVAT has been reported to be altered in hypertension. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study we used age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as well as Sprague-Dawley rats and tested effects of PVAT on mesenteric small arteries. Vessels were mounted in a Mulvany-Halpern myograph and cumulative concentration-response relations to noradrenaline were determined in the presence or absence of PVAT. We found that PVAT has an anti-contractile effect on mesenteric small vessels, irrespective of strains. A reduced effect of PVAT was observed in SHR compared to WKY rats; the difference between strains was eliminated by 10 µM XE991, a blocker of Kv7 (KCNQ) voltage-dependent potassium channels. The anti-contractile effect of PVAT was not affected by depolarizing smooth muscle cells with high K(+) solution. Sensitivities to exogenous vasodilators acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside were not potentiated but reduced in vessels with PVAT. Our results suggest that the reduced anti-contractile effect of PVAT in SHR correlates with a deficiency in Kv7 channels. Diffusion hindrance of PVAT is also a factor that should be considered in investigations on rat mesenteric small arteries.</p>

<p>Microvascular recruitment in muscle is a determinant of insulin sensitivity. Whether perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is involved in disturbed insulin-induced vasoreactivity is unknown, as are the underlying mechanisms. This study investigates whether PVAT regulates insulin-induced vasodilation in muscle, the underlying mechanisms, and how obesity disturbs this vasodilation. Insulin-induced vasoreactivity of resistance arteries was studied with PVAT from C57BL/6 or db/db mice. PVAT weight in muscle was higher in db/db mice compared with C57BL/6 mice. PVAT from C57BL/6 mice uncovered insulin-induced vasodilation; this vasodilation was abrogated with PVAT from db/db mice. Blocking adiponectin abolished the vasodilator effect of insulin in the presence of C57BL/6 PVAT, and adiponectin secretion was lower in db/db PVAT. To investigate this interaction further, resistance arteries of AMPKa2(+/+) and AMPKa2(-/-) were studied. In AMPKa2(-/-) resistance arteries, insulin caused vasoconstriction in the presence of PVAT, and AMPKa2(+/+) resistance arteries showed a neutral response. On the other hand, inhibition of the inflammatory kinase Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) in db/db PVAT restored insulin-induced vasodilation in an adiponectin-dependent manner. In conclusion, PVAT controls insulin-induced vasoreactivity in the muscle microcirculation through secretion of adiponectin and subsequent AMPKa2 signaling. PVAT from obese mice inhibits insulin-induced vasodilation, which can be restored by inhibition of JNK.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate the relationship between cardiac fat accumulation and insulin resistance. We discuss the current knowledge regarding the different techniques for measuring, in vivo in humans, cardiac fat deposition, the effects of systemic and myocardial insulin resistance and the clinical relevance of the relation between atherosclerosis and cardiac fat in conditions of insulin resistance.RECENT FINDINGS: In humans, fat accumulates mainly around the heart, as epicardial, perivascular and intrathoracic fat, but also inside the cardiomyocytes. All these cardiac fat depots have been shown to be markers of cardiac lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and local and systemic insulin resistance as well as of atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction.SUMMARY: Although cardiac fat is associated with impairment in heart metabolism and cardiac dysfunction, the interplay among cardiac fat accumulation, insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction remains to be fully established.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue (pvAT) may influence atherosclerotic plaque formation. We aim to determine the association between the local amount and inflammatory properties of pvAT and the size and composition of atherosclerotic plaque in the left anterior descending artery (LAD).METHODS: Post-mortem, a total of 139 cross sections of the LAD were obtained from 16 patients. PvAT quantity was measured within an area of 3 mm around the LAD (pvAT-area (%)). Furthermore, inflammatory properties of pvAT were measured (macrophages/400× field and adipocyte size). From plaque area (mm(2)), plaque/media-ratio was calculated and morphologic characteristics were scored (presence of a lipid core and calcification; collagen and smooth muscle cell content; macrophage (&lt;10, 10-50, &gt;50/400× field) and lymphocyte infiltration (&lt;10, 10-25, &gt;25/400× field)).RESULTS: Plaque/media-ratio increased with increasing pvAT-area (ß0.02; 95%CI 0.01-0.03) and pvAT-macrophages (ß 0.10; 95%CI 0.05-0.16), but not with adipocyte area (ß -0.00; 95%CI -0.07-0.06). PvAT-area was related to the presence of a lipid core (OR 1.05; 95%CI 1.03-1.08) and with macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration of atherosclerotic plaque (per increase in category OR 1.05; 95%CI 1.02-1.07 and OR 1.04; 95%CI 1.01-1.07 respectively). PvAT macrophage infiltration was correlated with adventitia and plaque macrophages.CONCLUSION: PvAT quantity and macrophage infiltration are highly related to atherosclerotic plaque size and composition in patients with coronary atherosclerosis. These results indicate potential involvement of pvAT in coronary atherosclerotic plaque development, although the causality of the relation has yet to be determined.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) is becoming widely used in regenerative medicine/cell therapy applications, and its physiological and pathological importance is increasingly appreciated. WAT is a complex organ composed of differentiated adipocytes, stromal mesenchymal progenitors known as adipose stromal cells (ASC), as well as endothelial vascular cells and infiltrating leukocytes. Two-dimensional (2D) culture that has been typically used for studying adipose cells does not adequately recapitulate WAT complexity. Improved methods for reconstruction of functional WAT ex vivo are instrumental for understanding of physiological interactions between the composing cell populations. Here, we used a three-dimensional (3D) levitation tissue culture system based on magnetic nanoparticle assembly to model WAT development and growth in organoids termed adipospheres. We show that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes remain viable in spheroids for a long period of time, while in 2D culture, they lose adherence and die after reaching confluence. Upon adipogenesis induction in 3T3-L1 adipospheres, cells efficiently formed large lipid droplets typical of white adipocytes in vivo, while only smaller lipid droplet formation is achievable in 2D. Adiposphere-based coculture of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with murine endothelial bEND.3 cells led to a vascular-like network assembly concomitantly with lipogenesis in perivascular cells. Adipocyte-depleted stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of mouse WAT cultured in 3D underwent assembly into organoids with vascular-like structures containing luminal endothelial and perivascular stromal cell layers. Adipospheres made from primary WAT cells displayed robust proliferation and complex hierarchical organization reflected by a matricellular gradient incorporating ASC, endothelial cells, and leukocytes, while ASC quickly outgrew other cell types in adherent culture. Upon adipogenesis induction, adipospheres derived from the SVF displayed more efficient lipid droplet accumulation than 2D cultures. This indicates that 3D intercellular signaling better recapitulates WAT organogenesis. Combined, our studies show that adipospheres are appropriate for WAT modeling ex vivo and provide a new platform for functional screens to identify molecules bioactive toward individual adipose cell populations. This 3D methodology could be adopted for WAT transplantation applications and aid approaches to WAT-based cell therapy.</p>

<p>Massive localized lymphedema is a reactive pseudotumor strongly associated with obesity. The tumor most commonly presents as pendulous masses in the lower limbs with only 3 reported cases involving external male genitalia. In this study, we report an additional 6 cases localized to the external male genitalia. The cases were retrospectively identified from the surgical pathology database of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. All 6 patients were obese (5 presented with diffuse scrotal edema and 1 with a penile mass). In all cases, the clinical impression was of a benign chronic process developing over 3 months to 1 year. All 3 cases from outside institutions were referred with benign pathologic diagnoses. The lesions ranged in size from 4 to 55 cm. Microscopically, all cases exhibited stromal fibrosis and edema, multinucleated stromal cells, perivascular chronic inflammation, and lymphangiectasia. Entrapped fat was a minor feature and seen in only 3 cases. Variable hyperplasia and hypertrophy of dartos muscle were noted in 6 lesions. Three cases showed prominent microvascular proliferation around the edge of individual dartos muscle bundles. In summary, diagnosis of massive localized lymphedema requires appropriate correlation between clinical and microscopic findings. Lesions in the male external genitalia share many microscopic findings with massive localized lymphedema at other sites, although entrapped adipose tissue is not prominent. Additional, although not specific, findings include variably hyperplastic and hypertrophic dartos muscle and capillary neoangiogenesis at the interface between smooth muscle bundles and stroma.</p>

<p>Epicardial and perivascular fat depot size is considered an index of cardiac and visceral obesity. The functional and anatomic proximity of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) to myocardium has drawn increasing attention in recent years among researchers attempting to elucidate its putative role as an endocrine organ. This includes the role of EAT as a lipid storing depot and as an inflammatory tissue secreting cytokines and chemokines under pathogenic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the potential EAT mediators of inflammation and the paracrine cross-talk between EAT and the underlying myocardium. We also highlight the most recent findings on the causes and correlates of myocardial steatosis/cardiac lipotoxicity and its association with cardiac dysfunction.</p>

<p>Endothelial dysfunction precedes atherosclerosis and represents an important link between obesity and cardiovascular events. Strategies designed to prevent endothelial dysfunction may therefore reduce the cardiovascular complications triggered by obesity. We tested the hypothesis that deficiency of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (Psgl-1) would improve the endothelial dysfunction associated with obesity. Psgl-1-deficient (Psgl-1(-/-)) and wild-type (Psgl-1(+/+)) mice were fed standard chow or a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (diet-induced obesity [DIO]) for 10 weeks. DIO increased mesenteric perivascular adipose tissue (mPVAT) macrophage content and vascular oxidative stress in Psgl-1(+/+) mice but not in Psgl-1(-/-) mice. Pressure myography using mesenteric arteries demonstrated that relaxation responses to acetylcholine were significantly impaired in DIO Psgl-1(+/+) mice, whereas DIO Psgl-1(-/-) mice were protected from endothelial dysfunction with similar relaxation responses to Psgl-1(+/+) or Psgl-1(-/-) mice fed standard chow. The superoxide scavenger 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPOL) partially recovered impaired endothelial function induced by DIO. A neutralizing Psgl-1 antibody was also effective in preventing endothelial dysfunction and reducing mPVAT macrophage content induced by DIO. These results indicate that obesity in mice leads to PVAT inflammation and endothelial dysfunction that is prevented by Psgl-1 deficiency. Psgl-1 inhibition may be a useful treatment strategy for targeting vascular disease associated with obesity.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) are currently the best candidate therapeutic cells for regenerative medicine related to osteoarticular, muscular, vascular and inflammatory diseases, although these cells remain heterogeneous and necessitate a better biological characterization. We and others recently described that MSC originate from two types of perivascular cells, namely pericytes and adventitial cells and contain the in situ counterpart of MSC in developing and adult human organs, which can be prospectively purified using well defined cell surface markers. Pericytes encircle endothelial cells of capillaries and microvessels and express the adhesion molecule CD146 and the PDGFRß, but lack endothelial and haematopoietic markers such as CD34, CD31, vWF (von Willebrand factor), the ligand for Ulex europaeus 1 (UEA1) and CD45 respectively. The proteoglycan NG2 is a pericyte marker exclusively associated with the arterial system. Besides its expression in smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle actin (aSMA) is also detected in subsets of pericytes. Adventitial cells surround the largest vessels and, opposite to pericytes, are not closely associated to endothelial cells. Adventitial cells express CD34 and lack aSMA and all endothelial and haematopoietic cell markers, as for pericytes. Altogether, pericytes and adventitial perivascular cells express in situ and in culture markers of MSC and display capacities to differentiate towards osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic cell lineages. Importantly, adventitial cells can differentiate into pericyte-like cells under inductive conditions in vitro. Altogether, using purified perivascular cells instead of MSC may bring higher benefits to regenerative medicine, including the possibility, for the first time, to use these cells uncultured.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a potent vasodilator. However, the complex mechanisms of vasoregulation by H(2)S are not fully understood. We tested the hypotheses that (1) H(2)S exerts vasodilatory effects by opening KCNQ-type voltage-dependent (K(v)) K(+) channels and (2) that H(2)S-producing cystathionine-<U+03B3>-lyase (CSE) in perivascular adipose tissue plays a major role in this pathway.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Wire myography of rat and mouse aortas was used. NaHS and 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (ADTOH) were used as H(2)S donors. KCNQ-type K(v) channels were blocked by XE991. 4-Propargylglycine (PPG) and ß-cyano-l-alanine (BCA), or 2-(aminooxy)-acetic acid (AOAA) were used as inhibitors of CSE or cystathionine-ß-synthase (CBS), respectively. NaHS and ADTOH produced strong vasorelaxation in rat and mouse aortas, which were abolished by KCNQ channel inhibition with XE991. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) exerted an anticontractile effect in these arteries. CSE inhibition by PPG and BCA reduced this effect in aortas from rats but not from mice. CBS inhibition with AOAA did not inhibit the anticontractile effects of PVAT. XE991, however, almost completely suppressed the anticontractile effects of PVAT in both species. Exogenous l-cysteine, substrate for the endogenous production of H(2)S, induced vasorelaxation only at concentrations &gt;5 mmol/l, an effect unchanged by CSE inhibition.SIGNFICANCE: Our results demonstrate potent vasorelaxant effects of H(2)S donors in large arteries of both rats and mice, in which XE991-sensitive KCNQ-type channel opening play a pivotal role. CSE-H(2)S seems to modulate the effect of adipocyte-derived relaxing factor in rat but not in mouse aorta. The present study provides novel insight into the interaction of CSE-H(2)S and perivascular adipose tissue. Furthermore, with additional technical advances, a future clinical approach targeting vascular H(2)S/KCNQ pathways to influence states of vascular dysfunction may be possible.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds most vessels and shares common features with brown adipose tissue (BAT). Although adaptive thermogenesis in BAT increases energy expenditure and is beneficial for metabolic diseases, little is known about the role of PVAT in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that the thermogenic function of PVAT regulates intravascular temperature and reduces atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: PVAT shares similar structural and proteomics with BAT. We demonstrated that PVAT has thermogenic properties similar to BAT in response to cold stimuli in vivo. Proteomics analysis of the PVAT from mice housed in a cold environment identified differential expression in proteins highly related to cellular metabolic processes. In a mouse model deficient in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> in smooth muscle cells (SMPG KO mice), we uncovered a complete absence of PVAT surrounding the vasculature, likely caused by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3> deletion in the perivascular adipocyte precursor cells as well. Lack of PVAT, which results in loss of its thermogenic activity, impaired vascular homeostasis, which caused temperature loss and endothelial dysfunction. We further showed that cold exposure inhibits atherosclerosis and improves endothelial function in mice with intact PVAT but not in SMPG KO mice as a result of impaired lipid clearance. Proinflammatory cytokine expression in PVAT is not altered on exposure to cold. Finally, prostacyclin released from PVAT contributes to the vascular protection against endothelial dysfunction.CONCLUSIONS: PVAT is a vasoactive organ with functional characteristics similar to BAT and is essential for intravascular thermoregulation of cold acclimation. This thermogenic capacity of PVAT plays an important protective role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>The differentiation of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) is essential to the remarkable microanatomic plasticity of lymphoid follicles. Here we show that FDC arise from ubiquitous perivascular precursors (preFDC) expressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor ß (PDGFRß). PDGFRß-Cre-driven reporter gene recombination resulted in FDC labeling, whereas conditional ablation of PDGFRß(+)-derived cells abolished FDC, indicating that FDC originate from PDGFRß(+) cells. Lymphotoxin-a-overexpressing prion protein (PrP)(+) kidneys developed PrP(+) FDC after transplantation into PrP(-) mice, confirming that preFDC exist outside lymphoid organs. Adipose tissue-derived PDGFRß(+) stromal-vascular cells responded to FDC maturation factors and, when transplanted into lymphotoxin ß receptor (LTßR)(-) kidney capsules, differentiated into Mfge8(+)CD21/35(+)Fc<U+03B3>RIIß(+)PrP(+) FDC capable of trapping immune complexes and recruiting B cells. Spleens of lymphocyte-deficient mice contained perivascular PDGFRß(+) FDC precursors whose expansion required both lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and lymphotoxin. The ubiquity of preFDC and their strategic location at blood vessels may explain the de novo generation of organized lymphoid tissue at sites of lymphocytic inflammation.</p>

<p>AIMS: High-fat diet (HFD) is associated with adipose inflammation, which contributes to key components of metabolic abnormalities. The expanded adipose tissue mass associated with obesity is the result of hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term HFD on adipocyte progenitor cell (APC) population and adipose-specific gene profiles in both white and brown adipose, and the role of perivascular adipose in the alteration of vascular function in response to HFD.MAIN METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard normal diet (ND) or HFD for about 8 months. Glucose metabolism was assessed by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. APC population and adipose-related gene profile were evaluated, and vascular function was measured in the presence or absence of perivascular adipose. Adiponectin and AMPK activity were also investigated.KEY FINDINGS: HFD induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and resulted in a decrease in APC population in brown, but not in white adipose tissue, when compared with animals fed a ND, with differential alterations of white and brown adipocyte-specific gene expression in brown and white adipose. Additionally, HFD led to altered vascular function in arteries in the presence of perivascular adipose tissue, which is associated with increased superoxide production. Adiponectin and AMPK activity were significantly decreased in response to long-term HFD.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that long-term high-fat intake differentially alters adipocyte progenitor population and adipose-related gene expression in adipose tissue, and adiponectin-AMPK signaling might be involved. In addition, HFD induces changes in perivascular adipose-mediated vascular function.</p>

<p>Leptin causes vasodilatation both by endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Leptin is synthesized by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). The hypothesis of this study is that a decrease of leptin production in PVAT of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) might contribute to a diminished paracrine anticontractile effect of the hormone. We have determined in aorta from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and SHR (i) leptin mRNA and protein levels in PVAT, (ii) the effect of leptin and PVAT on contractile responses, and (iii) leptin-induced relaxation and nitric oxide (NO) production. Leptin mRNA and protein expression were significantly lower in PVAT from SHR. Concentration-response curves to angiotensin II were significantly blunted in presence of PVAT as well as by exogenous leptin (10(-9)<U+2009>M) only in WKY. This anticontractile effect was endothelium-dependent. Vasodilatation induced by leptin was smaller in SHR than in WKY, and was also endothelium-dependent. Moreover, release of endothelial NO in response to acute leptin was higher in WKY compared to SHR, but completely abolished in the absence of endothelium. In conclusion, the reduced anticontractile effect of PVAT in SHR might be attributed to a reduced PVAT-derived leptin and to an abrogated effect of leptin on endothelial NO release probably due to an impaired activation of endothelial NO synthase.</p>

<p>RATIONALE: Calcium entry is pivotal in the heart and blood vessels, but its significance and mechanisms in adipose tissue are largely unknown. An important factor produced by adipocytes is adiponectin, which confers myocardial protection, insulin-sensitization, and antiatherosclerotic effects.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relevance of calcium channels to adipocytes and the production of adiponectin.METHODS AND RESULTS: Microarray analysis led to identification of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)1 and TRPC5 as channel subunits that are induced when adipocytes mature. Both subunits were found in perivascular fat of patients with atherosclerosis. Intracellular calcium and patch-clamp measurements showed that adipocytes exhibit constitutively active calcium-permeable nonselective cationic channels that depend on TRPC1 and TRPC5. The activity could be enhanced by lanthanum or rosiglitazone, known stimulators of TRPC5 and TRPC5-containing channels. Screening identified lipid modulators of the channels that are relevant to adipose biology. Dietary <U+03C9>-3 fatty acids (eg, a-linolenic acid) were inhibitory at concentrations that are achieved by ingestion. The adipocyte TRPC1/TRPC5-containing channel was functionally negative for the generation of adiponectin because channel blockade by antibodies, knock-down of TRPC1-TRPC5 in vitro, or conditional disruption of calcium permeability in TRPC5-incorporating channels in vivo increased the generation of adiponectin. The previously recognized capability of a-linolenic acid to stimulate the generation of adiponectin was lost when calcium permeability in the channels was disrupted.CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that TRPC1 and TRPC5 contribute a constitutively active heteromultimeric channel of adipocytes that negatively regulates adiponectin and through which <U+03C9>-3 fatty acids enhance the anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin.</p>

<p>The main physiological function of adipose-derived stromal/progenitor cells (ASC) is to differentiate into adipocytes. ASC are most likely localized at perivascular sites in adipose tissues and retain the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell types. Although cell surface markers for ASC have been described, there is no complete consensus on the antigen expression pattern that will precisely define these cells. DLK1(PREF1) is an established marker for mouse adipocyte progenitors which inhibits adipogenesis. This suggests that DLK1(PREF1) could be a useful marker to characterize human ASC. The DLK1(PREF1) status of human ASC is however unknown. In the present study we isolated ASC from the heterogeneous stromal vascular fraction of subcutaneous abdominal fat pats of adult women. These cells were selected by their plastic adherence and expanded to passage 5. The ASC were characterized as relatively homogenous cell population with the capacity to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts and the immunophenotype CD105<U+207A>/CD90<U+207A>/CD34<U+207A>/CD31<U+207B>/FABP4<U+207B>. The ASC were positive for DLK1(PREF1) which was well expressed in proliferating and density arrested cells but downregulated in the course of adipogenic differentiation. To investigate whether DLK1(PREF1) plays a role in the regulation of adipogenesis in these cells RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments were conducted. Knockdown of DLK1(PREF1) in differentiating ASC resulted in a significant increase of the expression of the adipogenic key regulator PPAR<U+03B3>2 and of the terminal adipogenic differentiation marker FABP4. We conclude that DLK1(PREF1) is well expressed in human ASC and acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Moreover, DLK1(PREF1) could be a functional marker contributing to the characterization of human ASC.</p>

<p>The objective of this work was to collect and summarize relevant literature on the anatomy, histology, and imaging of apical support of the upper vagina and the uterus provided by the cardinal (CL) and uterosacral (USL) ligaments. A literature search in English, French, and German languages was carried out with the keywords apical support, cardinal ligament, transverse cervical ligament, Mackenrodt ligament, parametrium, paracervix, retinaculum uteri, web, uterosacral ligament, and sacrouterine ligament in the PubMed database. Other relevant journal and textbook articles were sought by retrieving references cited in previous PubMed articles. Fifty references were examined in peer-reviewed journals and textbooks. The USL extends from the S2 to the S4 vertebra region to the dorsal margin of the uterine cervix and/or to the upper third of the posterior vaginal wall. It has a superficial and deep component. Autonomous nerve fibers are a major constituent of the deep USL. CL is defined as a perivascular sheath with a proximal insertion around the origin of the internal iliac artery and a distal insertion on the cervix and/or vagina. It is divided into a cranial (vascular) and a caudal (neural) portions. Histologically, it contains mainly vessels, with no distinct band of connective tissue. Both the deep USL and the caudal CL are closely related to the inferior hypogastric plexus. USL and CL are visceral ligaments, with mesentery-like structures containing vessels, nerves, connective tissue, and adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue as a stem cell source is ubiquitously available and has several advantages compared to other sources. It is easily accessible in large quantities with minimal invasive harvesting procedure, and isolation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) yields a high amount of stem cells, which is essential for stem-cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. Several studies have provided evidence that ASCs in situ reside in a perivascular niche, whereas the exact localization of ASCs in native adipose tissue is still under debate. ASCs are isolated by their capacity to adhere to plastic. Nevertheless, recent isolation and culture techniques lack standardization. Cultured cells are characterized by their expression of characteristic markers and their capacity to differentiate into cells from meso-, ecto-, and entodermal lineages. ASCs possess a high plasticity and differentiate into various cell types, including adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, hepatocytes, neural cells, and endothelial and epithelial cells. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that ASCs are a heterogeneous mixture of cells containing subpopulations of stem and more committed progenitor cells. This paper summarizes and discusses the current knowledge of the tissue localization of ASCs in situ, their characterization and heterogeneity in vitro, and the lack of standardization in isolation and culture methods.</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome (MBS), a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and visceral fat accumulation, increases cardiovascular risks in postmenopausal women. In addition to visceral fat, perivascular adipose tissue has been recently found to play an important role in vascular pathophysiology. Hence, the present study investigates the effects of estrogen on both intra-abdominal fat (visceral fat) and periaortic fat (perivascular fat) accumulation as well as hypoxia in ovariectomized female rats. Female rats were divided into sham operation, ovariectomy and ovariectomy with 17ß-estradiol supplementation groups. Twelve weeks later, we found that estrogen improved MBS via reducing body weight gain, the weight of periaortic and intra-abdominal fat, hepatic triglyceride, and total serum cholesterol levels. Estrogen also increased insulin sensitivity through restoring glucose and serum leptin levels. For periaortic fat, western blot showed estrogen inhibited hypoxia by reducing the levels of VEGF and HIF-1a, which is consistent with the results from immunohistochemical staining. The correlation analysis indicated that perivascular fat had a positive correlation with body weight, intra-abdominal fat or serum total cholesterol, but a negative correlation with insulin sensitivity index. For intra-abdominal fat, real-time fluorescent RT-PCR showed estrogen improved fat dysfunction via reducing the levels of relative leptin, MCP-1 but increasing adiponectin mRNA. Estrogen reduced the levels of VEGF and HIF-1a to inhibit hypoxia but restored the levels of PPAR<U+03B3> and Srebp-1c, which are important for lipid capacity function of intra-abdominal fat. These results demonstrated estrogen improved MBS through down-regulating VEGF and HIF-1a to inhibit hypoxia of periaortic and intra-abdominal fat in ovariectomized female rats.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue exerts an anticontractile influence on vascular smooth muscle. This study was conducted to determine whether periureteral adipose tissue (PUAT) could exert a similar influence upon ureteral smooth muscle. Acetylcholine-stimulated (10(-7)<U+2009>M-10(-4)<U+2009>M) contractile responses of ureteral segments obtained from male Wistar rats were recorded in the presence and absence of PUAT. Ureters with PUAT generated phasic contractile responses with significantly lower frequencies (P &lt; 0.001) and magnitudes (P &lt; 0.001) compared with ureters cleared of their periureteral adipose tissue. Removal of PUAT significantly increased the frequency (P &lt; 0.01) and magnitude (P &lt; 0.01) of the contractile responses. Bioassay experiments demonstrated that ureters with PUAT released a transferable factor that significantly reduced frequencies (P &lt; 0.05), but not magnitudes, of the contractile responses of ureters cleared of PUAT. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NNA (10(-4)<U+2009>M) did not significantly influence the anticontractile effect exerted by ureters with PUAT. This is the first study to demonstrate that ureteral motility is influenced by its surrounding adipose tissue. The PUAT has an anticontractile effect which is mediated by a transferable factor released from the PUAT. The identity of the factor is unknown but does not exert its effect through nitric oxide.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Thiopental induces relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells through its direct and/or indirect vasodilator effects. The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and the endothelium are known to attenuate vascular contraction, and we have recently reported that PVAT potentiates the relaxation effect of propofol through endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Here, we studied the mechanisms of thiopental-induced vascular responses in relation to the involvement of PVAT and endothelium.METHODS: Thoracic aortic rings from male Wistar rats were prepared with or without PVAT (PVAT+ and PVAT-) and with an intact endothelium (E+) or with the endothelium removed (E-) for functional studies. The contraction and relaxation responses of these vessels to thiopental in the presence of agonists and various receptor antagonists and channel blockers were studied.RESULTS: In vessels pre-contracted with phenylephrine or KCl, thiopental-induced relaxation was highest in vessels denuded of both PVAT and the endothelium. PVAT attenuated the relaxation response to thiopental, and this attenuation effect was reduced by both angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor antagonists CV-11974 (2-n-butyl-4-choloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[2’-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-methyl]-imidazole) or losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. Thiopental at high concentration (3 × 10(-3) M) caused a contraction through an endothelin-dependent mechanism.CONCLUSIONS: Thiopental induced relaxation in rat aorta through an endothelium-independent pathway and the presence of PVAT, endothelium, or both attenuated this relaxation response through Ang II-dependent and endothelin-dependent mechanisms, respectively.</p>

<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a condition of unknown etiology whose pathological features include increased vascular resistance, perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary arteriolar remodeling. Although risk factors for PAH are poorly defined, recent studies indicate that obesity may be an important risk factor for this condition. The mechanisms leading to this association are largely unknown, but bioactive mediators secreted from adipose tissue have been implicated in this process. One of the most important mediators released from adipose tissue is the adipokine adiponectin. Adiponectin is highly abundant in the circulation of lean healthy individuals, and possesses well-described metabolic and antiinflammatory actions. Levels of adiponectin decrease with increasing body mass, and low levels are directly linked to the development of PAH in mice. Moreover, overexpression of adiponectin has been shown to protect mice from developing PAH in response to inflammation and hypoxia. Based on the findings from these studies, it is suggested that the effects of adiponectin are mediated, in part, through its antiinflammatory and antiproliferative properties. In this review, we discuss the emerging evidence demonstrating a role for adiponectin in lung vascular homeostasis and discuss how deficiency in this adipocyte-derived hormone might explain the recent association between obesity and PAH.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can generate multiple end-stage mesenchymal cell types and constitute a promising population of cells for regenerative therapies. Additionally, there is increasing evidence supporting other trophic activities of MSCs, including the ability to enable formation of vasculature in vivo. Although MSCs were originally isolated from the bone marrow, the presence of these cells in the stromal vascular fraction of multiple adult tissues has been recently recognized. However, it is unknown whether the capacity to modulate vasculogenesis is ubiquitous to all MSCs regardless of their tissue of origin. Here, we demonstrated that tissue-resident MSCs isolated from four distinct tissues have equal capacity to modulate endothelial cell function, including formation of vascular networks in vivo. MSCs were isolated from four murine tissues, including bone marrow, white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and myocardium. In culture, all four MSC populations secreted a plethora of pro-angiogenic factors that unequivocally induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). In vivo, co-implantation of MSCs with ECFCs into mice generated an extensive network of blood vessels with ECFCs specifically lining the lumens and MSCs occupying perivascular positions. Importantly, there were no differences among all four MSCs evaluated. Our studies suggest that the capacity to modulate the formation of vasculature is a ubiquitous property of all MSCs, irrespective of their original anatomical location. These results validate multiple tissues as potential sources of MSCs for future cell-based vascular therapies.</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS: Microalbuminuria represents an established surrogate marker of early diabetic nephropathy and glomerular microangiopathy. Increasing evidence is emerging of a role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) as an important link between obesity, insulin resistance and both macro- and microangiopathy. It is not known whether perivascular renal sinus fat (RSF) has an impact on microalbuminuria in the prediabetic stage. We investigated whether RSF quantified by MRI is associated with microalbuminuria before or after exercise.METHODS: Non-diabetic individuals at increased risk of type 2 diabetes were recruited into the Tübingen Lifestyle Intervention Program (TULIP); 146 participants took part in the analysis. RSF was measured in axial MRI sections at the level of the renal artery. Urine was collected before and after exercise stress testing.RESULTS: Participants (age 47 ± 12 years; mean ± SD) reached a mean exercise load of 176 ± 49 W, with a mean arterial peak pressure (MAPP) of 112 ± 14 mmHg. After adjusting for sex, age, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and MAPP during exercise, RSF was significantly associated with postexercise albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR; p = 0.006). No association between RSF and baseline BP could be observed after adjusting for confounders (p = 0.26), and there was no association between RSF and baseline ACR either (p = 0.2).CONCLUSIONS: RSF is associated with exercise-induced albuminuria independently of sex, age, VAT and MAPP in a non-diabetic cohort at diabetic risk. We conclude that PVAT in the renal sinus may play a role in the pathogenesis of microalbuminuria.</p>

<p>Renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma (E-AML) is a rare variant of angiomyolipoma (AML). It is a mesenchymal tumour believed to originate from the perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC). Unlike conventional AML which are benign, E-AML has a rare aggressive behaviour. Conventional AML is typically triphasic containing adipose tissue, smooth muscle and dystrophic vessels in variable proportions, while E-AML are generally composed of plump spindled and polygonal-shaped “epithelioid cells” showing clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional pleomorphic multinucleated giant cells. E-AML can be misdiagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) when these “epithelioid cells” show clearing. Only a small number of cases of E-AML have been reported with the standard treatment being radical or partial nephrectomy. We report the first case report of a surgeon-controlled robotic partial nephrectomy using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green dye on a 25-year-old woman with a T1B (6.6 cm) right renal mass. The final pathology revealed the diagnosis of E-AML. There was no recurrence and metastases after the 6-month follow-up.</p>

<p>We reported aldosterone as a novel adipocyte-derived factor that regulates vascular function. We aimed to investigate molecular mechanisms, signaling pathways, and functional significance of adipocyte-derived aldosterone and to test whether adipocyte-derived aldosterone is increased in diabetes mellitus-associated obesity, which contributes to vascular dysfunction. Studies were performed in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line and mature adipocytes isolated from human and mouse (C57BL/6J) adipose tissue. Mesenteric arteries with and without perivascular fat and mature adipocytes were obtained from obese diabetic db/db and control db/+ mice. Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2; mRNA and protein) was detected in 3T3-L1 and mature adipocytes, which secrete aldosterone basally and in response to angiotensin II (Ang II). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Ang II stimulation increased aldosterone secretion and CYP11B2 expression. Ang II effects were blunted by an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (candesartan) and inhibitors of calcineurin (cyclosporine A and FK506) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (VIVIT). FAD286 (aldosterone synthase inhibitor) blunted adipocyte differentiation. In candesartan-treated db/db mice (1 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) increased plasma aldosterone, CYP11B2 expression, and aldosterone secretion were reduced. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation in db/db mesenteric arteries containing perivascular fat was improved by eplerenone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) without effect in db/+ mice. Adipocytes possess aldosterone synthase and produce aldosterone in an Ang II/Ang II type 1 receptor/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells-dependent manner. Functionally adipocyte-derived aldosterone regulates adipocyte differentiation and vascular function in an autocrine and paracrine manner, respectively. These novel findings identify adipocytes as a putative link between aldosterone and vascular dysfunction in diabetes mellitus-associated obesity.</p>

<p>Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) are a promising cell source for vascular-based approaches to clinical therapeutics, as they have been shown to give rise to both endothelial and perivascular cells. While it is well known that ASCs can present a heterogeneous phenotypic profile, spontaneous interactions among these subpopulations that result in the formation of complex tissue structures have not been rigorously demonstrated. Our study reports the novel finding that ASCs grown in monolayers in the presence of angiogenic cues are capable of self-assembling into complex, three-dimensional vascular structures. This phenomenon is only apparent when the ASCs are seeded at a high density (20,000 cells/cm(2)) and occur through orchestrated interactions among three distinct subpopulations: CD31-positive cells (CD31+), a-smooth muscle actin-positive cells (aSMA+), and cells that are unstained for both these markers (CD31-/aSMA-). Investigations into the kinetics of the process revealed that endothelial vessel-like structures initially arose from individual CD31+ cells through proliferation and their interactions with CD31-/aSMA- cells. During this period, aSMA+ cells proliferated and appeared to migrate toward the vessel structures, eventually engaging in cell-cell contact with them after 1 week. By 2 weeks, the lumen-containing CD31+ vessels grew greater than a millimeter in length, were lined with vascular basement membrane proteins, and were encased within a dense, three-dimensional cluster of aSMA+ and CD31-/aSMA- cells. The recruitment of aSMA+ cells was largely due to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling, as the inhibition of PDGF receptors substantially reduced aSMA+ cell growth and vessel coverage. Additionally, we found that while hypoxia increased endothelial gene expression and vessel width, it also inhibited the growth of the aSMA+ population. Together, these findings underscore the potential use of ASCs in forming mature vessels in vitro as well as the need for a further understanding of the heterotypic interactions among ASC subpopulations.</p>

<p>Stromal cells of adipose tissue and human umbilical cord were isolated by the original method from general populations of multipotent subpopulation of multipotent stromal cells exhibiting perivascular phenotype (CD146+, CD31-). Effective directed differentiation of these cells into insulin-producing cells by transient transfection of the gene Pdx1 was demonstrated. Transfection multipotent stromal cells CD146-, CD31- derived from adipose tissue and umbilical cord and isolated by the standard method, did not result in activation of insulin gene transcription. It was shown that the expression of nestin was not necessary for effective pancreatic cell differentiation.</p>

In this review of the contributions of the adventitia and adventitial lymphocytes to the development of atherosclerosis, we discuss recent research on the formation and structural nature of adventitial immune aggregates, potential mechanisms of crosstalk between the intima, media, and adventitia, specific contributions of B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, and the role of the vasa vasorum and surrounding perivascular adipose tissue. Furthermore, we highlight techniques for the imaging of lymphocytes in the vasculature.</p>

<p>Adipokines secreted by visceral, subcutaneous, and perivascular adipocytes are involved in the regulation of vascular tone by acting as circulatory hormones (leptin, adiponectin, omentin, visfatin, angiotensin II, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, apelin) and/or via local paracrine factors (perivascular adipocyte-derived relaxing and contractile factors). Vascular tone regulation by adipokines is compromised in obesitas and obesity-related disorders. Hypoxia created in growing adipose tissue dysregulates synthesis of vasoactive adipokines in favor of harmful proinflammatory adipokines, while the levels of the cardioprotective adipokines adiponectin and omentin decrease. Considering the potential of the role of adipokines in obesity-related vascular diseases, strategies to counter these diseases by targeting the adipokines are discussed.</p>

<p>Accumulation of macrophages and T cells within crown-like structures (CLS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue predicts disease severity in obesity-related insulin resistance (OIR). Although rodent data suggest the B cell is an important feature of these lesions, B cells have not been described within the human CLS. In order to identify B cells in the human subcutaneous CLS (sCLS) in obese subjects and determine whether the presence of B cells predict insulin resistance, we examined archived samples of subcutaneous and omental fat from 32 obese men and women and related findings to clinical parameters. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified B (CD19(+)) and T cells (CD3 (+)) within the sCLS and perivascular space. The presence and density of B cells (B cells per high-power field (pHPF), T cells pHPF, and B cell:T cell (B:T) ratio) were compared with measures of insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)) and other variables. In 16 of 32 subjects (50%) CD19(+) B cells were localized within sCLS and were relatively more numerous than T cells. HOMA was not different between subjects with CD19(+) vs. CD19(-) sCLS (5.5 vs. 5.3, P = 0.88). After controlling for diabetes and glycemia (hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c))), the B:T ratio correlated with current metformin treatment (r = 0.89, P = 0.001). These results indicate that in human OIR, B cells are an integral component of organized inflammation in subcutaneous fat, and defining their role will lead to a better understanding of OIR pathogenesis and potentially impact treatment.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: A myocardial bridge (MB) is a band of myocardium covering a coronary artery segment, typically located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Bridged segments of the coronary artery are isolated from the influence of perivascular adipose tissue. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between MBs and atherosclerosis in bridged LAD segments and to evaluate whether perivascular adipose tissue is involved in this relationship.METHODS: MBs were identified in the coronary arteries of patients referred for diagnostic cardiac CT. The calcium score of MBs of the LAD or, in patients without LAD-MBs, of a corresponding LAD segment at the same distance from its origin and over the same length was measured.RESULTS: Of 128 patients, 56 (44%) had in total 73 MBs. The mean MB length was 22 ± 14 mm and the median MB thickness was 0.8mm (interquartile range 0.3-2.1mm). MBs in the LAD were present in 40 patients (31%). The calcium score was 0 in 95% of the LAD segments with MBs compared with 52% of the corresponding LAD segments without MBs. The association between LAD-MBs and calcium score (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.25) was not influenced by age and gender, but was attenuated by local perivascular adipose tissue thickness (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04-2.70).CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery segments covered with an MB have a lower calcium score than segments without an MB. The association between MBs and calcium scores was influenced by local perivascular adipose tissue thickness.</p>

<p>A small amount of adipose tissue associated with small arteries and arterioles is encountered both in mice and man. This perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has a paracrine effect on the vascular tone regulation. PVAT is expanded in obesity and in diabetes. This expansion not only involves enlargement of fat cells, but also the accumulation of inflammatory cells and a shift in the production of adipokines and cytokines. This effect is illustrated in this review by the effect of PVAT-derived factors of insulin-mediated vasoregulation in mouse resistance arteries. Insulin sensitivity of endothelial cells is also involved in the insulin-mediated regulation of muscle glucose uptake. Insulin affects vasoregulation by acting on different signaling pathways regulating NO and endothelin-1 release. This process is influenced by various adipokines and inflammatory mediators released from PVAT, and is affected by the degree of expansion and content of inflammatory cells. It is modulated by adiponectin (via 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, AMPK), TNFa (via c-jun N-terminal kinase) and free fatty acids (via protein kinase C-<U+03B8>). PVAT thus provides an important site of control of vascular (dys)function in obesity and type 2 diabetes. An altered profile of adipokine and cytokine production by PVAT of resistance arteries may also contribute to or modulate hypertension, but a causal role in hypertension has still to be established.</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS: We have previously found that the mass of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) correlates negatively with insulin sensitivity and post-ischaemic increase in blood flow. To understand how PVAT communicates with vascular vessels, interactions between perivascular, subcutaneous and visceral fat cells with endothelial cells (ECs) were examined with regard to inflammatory, metabolic and angiogenic proteins. To test for possible in vivo relevance of these findings, circulating levels of the predominant secretion product, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), was measured in individuals carefully phenotyped for fat distribution patterns.METHODS: Mono- and co-cultures of human primary fat cells with ECs were performed. mRNA expression and protein production were studied using Luminex, cytokine array, RealTime Ready and ELISA systems. Effects of HGF on vascular cells were determined by WST assays. In patients, HGF levels were measured by ELISA, and the mass of different fat compartments was determined by whole-body MRI.RESULTS: In contrast with other fat cell types, PVAT cells released higher amounts of angiogenic factors, e.g. HGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor, thrombospondin-1, serpin-E1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein -3. Cocultures showed different expression profiles from monocultures, and mature adipocytes differed from pre-adipocytes. HGF was preferentially released by PVAT cells and stimulated EC growth and smooth muscle cell cytokine release. Finally, in 95 patients, only PVAT, not visceral or subcutaneous mass, correlated independently with serum HGF levels (p = 0.03; r = 0.225).CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular (pre-)adipocytes differ substantially from other fat cells with regard to mRNA expression and protein production of angiogenic factors. This may contribute to fat tissue growth and atherosclerotic plaque complications. Higher levels of angiogenic factors, such as HGF, in patients with increased perivascular fat mass may have pathological relevance.</p>

<p>Progress has been made in elucidating the cell-surface phenotype of primary adipose progenitors; however, specific functional markers and distinct molecular signatures of fat depot-specific preadipocytes have remained elusive. In this study, we label committed murine adipose progenitors through expression of GFP from the genetic locus for Zfp423, a gene controlling preadipocyte determination. Selection of GFP-expressing fibroblasts from either subcutaneous or visceral adipose-derived stromal vascular cultures isolates stably committed preadipocytes that undergo robust adipogenesis. Immunohistochemistry for Zfp423-driven GFP expression in vivo confirms a perivascular origin of preadipocytes within both white and brown adipose tissues. Interestingly, a small subset of capillary endothelial cells within white and brown fat also express this marker, suggesting a contribution of specialized endothelial cells to the adipose lineage. Zfp423(GFP) mice represent a simple tool for the specific localization and isolation of molecularly defined preadipocytes from distinct adipose tissue depots.</p>

<p>The interaction between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, cancer and other diseases. Thus, antioxidant strategies may be important in immune regulation and in limiting inflammation. Surprisingly, large clinical trials have shown that ROS scavenging by antioxidant vitamins is ineffective or even harmful in spite of the fact that reactive oxygen species themselves are pro-inflammatory, regulate immune system and enhance atherosclerosis. Therefore, there is a need of novel, more specific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory approaches aimed on prevention of ROS formation, by targeting specific molecular pathways involved in ROS generation and their activation of pro-inflammatory cascades. Potential targets include the NADPH oxidases (Nox enzymes), xanthine oxidase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and mitochondrial oxidases. Nox enzymes play central role, as they can stimulate other enzymatic sources of ROS. The interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress is discussed in the context of adipose tissue, perivascular inflammation and role of the central nervous system in immune regulation. All of the above participate in “brain-vessel axis” critical in the pathogenesis of numerous pathologies. Role of cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-17 or IL-6 and their links to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production are discussed. Statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, block upstream signaling of Nox activation, including MAP kinase signaling or G protein activation, which contribute to their clinical effectiveness. Here, we discuss novel possibilities that drugs directly inhibiting Nox activation could successfully inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation related to cardiovascular disease. Moreover, we describe potential gene therapy approaches in limiting oxidative stress in the vasculature. These approaches can become also useful in cancer immunomodulation.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes and its major risk factor, obesity, are a growing burden for public health. The mechanisms that connect obesity and its related disorders, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, are still undefined. Microvascular dysfunction may be a pathophysiologic link between insulin resistance and hypertension in obesity. Many studies have shown that adipose tissue-derived substances (adipokines) interact with (micro)vascular function and influence insulin sensitivity. In the past, research focused on adipokines from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). In this review, we focus on the interactions between adipokines, predominantly from PVAT, and microvascular function in relation to the development of insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>The original concept of adipose tissue as an inert storage depot for the excess of energy has evolved over the last years and it is now considered as one of the most important organs regulating body homeostasis. This conceptual change has been supported by the demonstration that adipose tissue serves as a major endocrine organ, producing a wide variety of bioactive molecules, collectively termed adipokines, with endocrine, paracrine and autocrine activities. Adipose tissue is indeed a complex organ wherein mature adipocytes coexist with the various cell types comprising the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF), including preadipocytes, adipose-derived stem cells, perivascular cells, and blood cells. It is known that not only mature adipocytes but also the components of SVF produce adipokines. Furthermore, adipokine production, proliferative and metabolic activities and response to regulatory signals (i.e. insulin, catecholamines) differ between the different fat depots, which have been proposed to underlie their distinct association to specific diseases. Herein, we discuss the recent proteomic studies on adipose tissue focused on the analysis of the separate cellular components and their secretory products, with the aim of identifying the basic features and the contribution of each component to different adipose tissue-associated pathologies.</p>

<p>The heart and blood vessels are surrounded by epicardial and perivascular adipose tissues, respectively, which play important roles in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis by secreting a number of biologically active molecules, termed “adipokines.” Many of these adipokines function as an important component of the ‘adipo-cardiovascular axis’ mediating the cross talk between adipose tissues, the heart, and the vasculature. On the one hand, most adipokines [including tumor necrosis factor-a, resistin, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP), and lipocalin-2] are proinflammatory and causally associated with endothelial and cardiac dysfunction by their endocrine/paracrine actions. On the other hand, adiponectin is one of the few adipokines that possesses multiple salutary effects on the prevention of cardiovascular disease, because of its pleiotropic actions on the heart and the blood vessels. The discordant production of adipokines in dysfunctional adipose tissue is a key contributor to obesity-related cardiovascular disease. This review provides an update in understanding the roles of adipokines in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders associated with obesity and diabetes and focuses on the two most abundant adipokines, adiponectin and A-FABP. Indeed, data from both animal studies and clinical investigations imply that these two adipokines are prognostic biomarkers for cardiovascular disease and even promising therapeutic targets for its treatment.</p>

<p>Technological developments based on the use of autologous white adipose tissue (WAT) attracted attention to minor fat depots as possible sources of adipose tissue. In plastic surgery, the trochanteric fatty pad is one of the most used WAT depots for its location and organoleptic characteristics that make it particularly suitable for reconstructive procedures. Despite its wide use in clinic, the structure of this depot has never been studied in detail and it is not known if structural differences exist among trochanteric fat and other subcutaneous WAT depots. The present study was performed on trochanteric fat pad with the aim to clarify the morphology of its adipocytes, stroma and microcirculation, with particular reference to the stem niches. Histological and ultrastructural studies showed that the main peculiar feature of the trochanteric fat concerns its stromal component, which appears less dense than in the other subcutaneous WATs studied. The intra-parenchymal collagen stroma is poor and the extracellular compartment shows large spaces, filled with electron-light material, in which isolated collagen bundles are present. The adipocytes are wrapped in weak and easily detachable collagen baskets. These connective sheaths are very thin compared to the sheaths in other subcutaneous WAT depots. The capillaries are covered by large, long and thin elements surrounded by an external lamina; these perivascular cells are poor in organelles and mainly contain poly-ribosomes. In conclusion, when compared to other WAT deposits, the trochanteric fatty pad shows structural peculiarities in its stroma and microcirculation suggesting a high regenerative potential. Resistance, dissociability, microvascular weft and high regenerative potential make the trochanteric fatty pad a privileged source for harvesting in autologous WAT-based regenerative procedures.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether rats infected with Trypanosoma evansi had neurological and locomotor signs, as well as histological lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) and pelvic muscles. To carry out this study, 52 rats were used and divided into two groups. The animals in Group A (n=40) were infected with T. evansi, and the rats in Group B (n=12) were used as negative controls (non-infected). Neurological examination was performed at Days 5, 15, 30 and 150 post-infection (PI) with eventual euthanasia of the rats. Samples of brain, spinal cord and skeletal muscle (biceps femoris and gastrocnemius muscles) were collected. The neurological tests evaluated motor capacity, balance and pain sensitivity. At Day 5 PI in Subgroup A1, the rats showed high parasitemia, became apathetic and presented with slow movements and signs of disorientation. After Day 15 PI in Subgroup A2 and Day 30 PI in Subgroup A3, no more clinical abnormalities were observed. Histologically, there was no damage to the CNS in these three subgroups, but within Subgroup A3, mononuclear infiltration of the muscle was observed. Rats chronically infected (Subgroup A4 - Day 150 PI) showed muscle atrophy, walking dysfunction and paralysis of the hind limbs. Mild mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and perivascular cuffs were observed in the CNS of some of the animals in Subgroup A4. In these rats, severe muscle damage was observed in the skeletal muscle which included atrophy and loss of muscle fibers, multinucleated giant muscle cells, mononuclear myositis, Wallerian degeneration of the innervating fibers and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the perineurium and adipose tissue. Based upon these findings, we conclude that infection by T. evansi in rats leads to muscle damage, which is probably the cause of the paralysis of hind limbs.</p>

<p>In mammalian skin, the existence of stem cells in the dermis is still poorly understood. Previous studies have indicated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are situated as pericytes in various mammalian tissues. We speculated that the human adult dermis also contains MSC-like cells positive for CD34 at perivascular sites similar to adipose tissue. At first, stromal cells from adult scalp skin tissues showed colony-forming ability and differentiated into mesenchymal lineages (osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic). Three-dimensional analysis of scalp skin with a confocal microscope clearly demonstrated that perivascular cells were positive for not only NG2, but also CD34, immunoreactivity. Perivascular CD34-positive cells were abundant around follicular portions. Furthermore, CD34-positive cell fractions collected with magnetic cell sorting were capable of differentiating into mesenchymal lineages. This study suggests that dermal perivascular sites act as a niche of MSCs in human scalp skin, which are easily accessible and useful in regenerative medicine.</p>

<p>The sap of Acer okamotoanum has been termed ‘bone-benefit-water’ in Korea owing to its mineral and sugar content. In particular, the calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) concentrations of the sap of Acer okamotoanum are 40- and 20-times higher, respectively, than commercial spring water. In the present study, we examined whether Acer okamotoanum sap improves or prevents hypertension-like symptoms in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8-weeks-old) were provided commercial spring water supplemented with 25, 50 or 100% Acer okamotoanum sap, 3% potassium ions (K+) or captopril, and treated daily for 2 weeks with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 mg/kg/day) by subcutaneous injection, in order to induce hypertensive symptoms. Rats were euthanized 6 h following the final injection. To assess the effect of the sap on hypertension-like symptoms, we examined the mean blood pressure (BP), protein levels and localization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the descending aorta of the rats. BP levels were significantly lower in hypertensive rats received 25, 50 and 100% sap compared with rats who were administered only commercial spring water. Protein levels of eNOS were repressed in L-NAME-only-treated rats, but were elevated in the descending aorta of rats administered captopril, K+ water and Acer okamotoanum sap (25, 50 and 100%) up to the level of the sham group provided commercial spring water, and then injected with dimethyl sulfoxide for the same period of time. Localized eNOS protein was abundantly expressed in the perivascular descending aorta adipose tissue of the rats. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the sap of Acer okamotoanum ameliorated high BP induced by L-NAME treatment in a rat model.</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANCE: Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Statins reduce plasma low-density lipoproteins, inhibit inflammatory reaction, improve endothelial function, ameliorate oxidative stress, and reduce platelet activity. Consequently, statins markedly decrease the risk of acute cardiovascular events. H(2)S is synthesized in all layers of the vascular wall, including the endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT).RECENT ADVANCES: Recent studies demonstrate that PVAT-derived H(2)S decreases vascular tone by activating K(ATP) and/or KCNQ potassium channels in smooth muscle cells. Lipophilic atorvastatin, but not hydrophilic pravastatin, increases net H(2)S production in PVAT by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation, and augments the anticontractile effect of PVAT. Inhibition of H(2)S metabolism results from atorvastatin-induced decrease in coenzyme Q, which is a cofactor of H(2)S oxidation by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. In contrast to H(2)S, statins do not impair mitochondrial oxidation of organic substrates.CRITICAL ISSUES: Taking into account antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effect of H(2)S, the gas may mediate some of the beneficial effects of statins on the cardiovascular system. In addition, specific statins differ in their ability to enhance H(2)S signaling.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Since both statins and H(2)S reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, the possible effect of statins on H(2)S oxidation in other tissues such as the heart and the kidney needs to be examined. Inhibition of H(2)S metabolism may be a new therapeutic strategy to improve H(2)S signaling, especially in the mitochondrial compartment.</p>

<p>Many features of adipose stem/progenitor cells, including their physiological functions and localization, have been clarified in the past decade. Adipose tissue turns over very slowly, with perivascular progenitor cells differentiating into new adipocytes to replace dead adipocytes. A number of clinical trials using freshly isolated or cultured adipose-derived stromal cells containing adipose progenitor/stem cells are ongoing. Therapeutic use of adipose stem/progenitor cells has been shown to promote angiogenesis and adipose tissue regeneration. Identification of adipocyte-releasing factors upon apoptosis/necrosis would be a breakthrough and could lead to the next stage for adipose tissue regeneration. Activation of precursors in perichondrium and periosteum shows a dramatic neogenesis by simple injection and is an ideal example of in situ tissue engineering. The ‘hit and catch’ strategy using a mobilizer of bone-marrow stem/progenitor cells (hit) and attractants to lead the cells to proper homing into the target tissue (catch) may be the future of stem cell manipulation. Careful design of the microenvironment, cell delivery protocol to avoid unexpected behavior and induce maximal potential, and selection of target diseases, will be critical to the success of clinical applications of adipose-derived stromal cells.</p>

<p>An increased demand for soft-tissue substitutes has impelled the development of an in vitro adipose tissue. Ideally, such a tissue should contain a vascular network that can deliver blood throughout the construct following its engraftment. This study describes the in vitro fabrication of a pre-vascularized adipose tissue entirely using a self-assembly approach. Adult human adipose stromal cells (ASCs) provided the foundation for this construct. These cells were cultured at high density in the presence of elevated levels of ascorbate prior to adipocytic induction. Vascular support cells consisting of dermal fibroblasts, mixtures of adipose stromal cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were introduced to sustain an extensive vascular network formed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). MSCs were introduced to serve as perivascular cells. The resulting construct contained a vascular-adipose tissue continuum that was held together by basement membrane molecules. This construct contains multiple cell types that are typically found in adipose tissue: adipocytes, pre-adipocytes, stem cells, fibroblasts, vascular cells, and perivascular support cells. As such, these constructs can be employed both for in vitro studies to assay cellular interactions between vasculature and other components of adipose tissue. Further, they can also be engrafted into athymic hosts to study vascular and adipocyte stability.</p>

<p>The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), critically involved in the control of blood pressure and volume homeostasis, is a dual system comprising a circulating component and a local tissue component. The rate limiting enzyme is renin, which in the circulating RAS derives from the kidney to generate Ang II, which in turn regulates cardiovascular function by binding to AT(1) and AT(2) receptors on cardiac, renal and vascular cells. The tissue RAS can operate independently of the circulating RAS and may be activated even when the circulating RAS is suppressed or normal. A functional tissue RAS has been identified in brain, kidney, heart, adipose tissue, hematopoietic tissue, gastrointestinal tract, liver, endocrine system and blood vessels. Whereas angiotensinsinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), Ang I and Ang II are synthesized within these tissues, there is still controversy as to whether renin is produced locally or whether it is taken up from the circulation, possibly by the (pro)renin receptor. This is particularly true in the vascular wall, where expression of renin is very low. The exact function of the vascular RAS remains elusive, but may contribute to fine-tuning of vascular tone and arterial structure and may amplify vascular effects of the circulating RAS, particularly in pathological conditions, such as in hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes. New concepts relating to the vascular RAS have recently been elucidated including: (1) the presence of functionally active Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis in the vascular system, (2) the importance of the RAS in perivascular adipose tissue and cross talk with vessels, and (3) the contribution to vascular RAS of Ang II derived from immune and inflammatory cells within the vascular wall. The present review highlights recent progress in the RAS field, focusing on the tissue system and particularly on the vascular RAS.</p>

<p>PVAT (perivascular adipose tissue) has recently been recognized as a novel factor in vascular biology, with implications in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. Composed mainly of adipocytes, PVAT releases a wide range of biologically active molecules that modulate vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, proliferation and migration. PVAT exerts an anti-contractile effect in various vascular beds which seems to be mediated by an as yet elusive PVRF [PVAT-derived relaxing factor(s)]. Considerable progress has been made on deciphering the nature and mechanisms of action of PVRF, and the PVRFs proposed until now are reviewed here. However, complex pathways seem to regulate PVAT function and more than one mechanism is probably responsible for PVAT actions in vascular biology. The present review describes our current knowledge on the structure and function of PVAT, with a focus on its role in modulating vascular tone. Potential involvements of PVAT dysfunction in obesity, hypertension and atherosclerosis will be highlighted.</p>

<p>Obesity is an ongoing worldwide epidemic. Besides being a medical condition in itself, obesity dramatically increases the risk of development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. This risk appears to stem from multiple abnormalities in adipose tissue function leading to a chronic inflammatory state and to dysregulation of the endocrine and paracrine actions of adipocyte-derived factors.

Besides being a medical condition in itself, obesity dramatically increases the risk of development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. This risk appears to stem from multiple abnormalities in adipose tissue function leading to a chronic inflammatory state and to dysregulation of the endocrine and paracrine actions of adipocyte-derived factors. These, in turn, disrupt vascular homeostasis by causing an imbalance between the NO pathway and the endothelin 1 system, with impaired insulin-stimulated endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that the vascular dysfunction of obesity is not just limited to the endothelium, but also involves the other layers of the vessel wall. In particular, obesity-related changes in medial smooth muscle cells seem to disrupt the physiological facilitatory action of insulin on the responsiveness to vasodilator stimuli, whereas the adventitia and perivascular fat appear to be a source of pro-inflammatory and vasoactive factors that may contribute to endothelial and smooth muscle cell dysfunction, and to the pathogenesis of vascular disease.

<p>We previously demonstrated that human pericytes, which encircle capillaries and microvessels, give rise in culture to genuine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This raised the question as to whether all MSC are derived from pericytes. Pericytes and other cells defined on differential expression of CD34, CD31, and CD146 were sorted from the stromal vascular fraction of human white adipose tissue. Besides pericytes, CD34+ CD31- CD146- CD45- cells, which reside in the outmost layer of blood vessels, the tunica adventitia, natively expressed MSC markers and gave rise in culture to clonogenic multipotent progenitors identical to standard bone marrow-derived MSC. Despite common MSC features and developmental properties, adventitial cells and pericytes retain distinct phenotypes and genotypes through culture. However, in the presence of growth factors involved in vascular remodeling, adventitial cells acquire a pericytes-like phenotype. In conclusion, we demonstrate the co-existence of 2 separate perivascular MSC progenitors: pericytes in capillaries and microvessels and adventitial cells around larger vessels.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived relaxing factor (PVATRF) significantly regulates vascular tone. Its chemical nature remains unknown. We determined whether palmitic acid methyl ester (PAME) was the PVATRF and whether its release and/or vasorelaxing activity decreased in hypertension.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using superfusion bioassay cascade technique, tissue bath myography, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we determined PVATRF and PAME release from aortic PVAT preparations of Wistar Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The PVAT of Wistar Kyoto rats spontaneously and calcium dependently released PVATRF and PAME. Both induced aortic vasorelaxations, which were inhibited by 4-aminopyridine (2 mmol/L) and tetraethylammonium 5 and 10 mmol/L but were not affected by tetraethylammonium 1 or 3 mmol/L, glibenclamide (3 µmol/L), or iberiotoxin (100 nmol/L). Aortic vasorelaxations induced by PVATRF- and PAME-containing Krebs solutions were not affected after heating at 70°C but were equally attenuated after hexane extractions. Culture mediums of differentiated adipocytes, but not those of fibroblasts, contained significant PAME and caused aortic vasorelaxation. The PVAT of spontaneously hypertensive rats released significantly less PVATRF and PAME with an increased release of angiotensin II. In addition, PAME-induced relaxation of spontaneously hypertensive rats aortic smooth muscle diminished drastically, which was ameliorated significantly by losartan.CONCLUSIONS: We found that PAME is the PVATRF, causing vasorelaxation by opening voltage-dependent K+ channels on smooth muscle cells. Diminished PAME release and its vasorelaxing activity and increased release of angiotensin II in the PVAT suggest a noble role of PVAT in pathogenesis of hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of losartan is attributed partly to its reversing diminished PAME-induced vasorelaxation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: To determine the tissue penetration of vancomycin into perivascular fat and arterial wall during a continuous infusion of vancomycin, given as prophylaxis for vascular surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing arterial reconstruction requiring antibiotic prophylaxis were included. Patients received a loading infusion of vancomycin the evening prior to surgery followed by a continuous 24 h infusion, calculated according to renal function. Three peri-operative serum samples and intra-operative perivascular fat and arterial wall samples were collected for vancomycin assay.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included. Three serum samples were obtained from all patients, fat samples were available from 27 (96.4%) patients and vessel wall samples were available from 23 (82.1%) patients. Serum vancomycin concentrations were maintained within a relatively narrow range, while fat and arterial wall concentrations were highly variable.CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that prophylactic administration of vancomycin with a loading infusion followed by a continuous infusion before and during vascular surgery achieves serum and vascular tissue concentrations that are above the MICs for most common organisms implicated in post-operative graft infection. However, penetration into perivascular fat tissues is poor.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Epicardial adipose tissue is associated with coronary artery disease, however the causal relationship between perivascular adipose tissue and local atherogenesis is unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice underwent transplantation of visceral or subcutaneous adipose tissue immediately adjacent to the right common carotid artery. Carotid arteries with fat transplants were analyzed for atherosclerosis by surface oil-red-O staining and cross-sectional analysis. Vascular function of the carotid arteries was assessed using pressure myography. Visceral fat transplants were also performed to ApoE(-/-) mice with neutralization of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (Psgl-1). Atherosclerosis surface area and lesion thickness were greater in mice receiving the perivascular visceral fat compared to the subcutaneous fat. Mice with visceral fat transplants also displayed more complicated atherosclerotic lesions with evidence of atherothrombosis. Serum Mcp-1 was higher in mice receiving visceral fat transplants compared to subcutaneous transplants. Visceral fat transplantation also caused impaired endothelial-dependent relaxation of the carotid artery. Psgl-1 deficiency or neutralization of Psgl-1 with an anti-Psgl-1 antibody was protective against perivascular visceral adipose tissue-induced atherosclerosis and was associated with reduced Mcp-1 levels.CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular visceral fat leads to endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis. This proatherogenic effect of perivascular adipose tissue is blocked by neutralization of Psgl-1.</p>

<p>AIMS: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is known to secrete vascular relaxation factors, and angiotensin 1-7 [Ang-(1-7)] acting on the endothelium is one of the endothelium-dependent relaxation factors. Mas protein is the receptor for Ang-(1-7). Using aorta from Mas-knockout (K/O) and wild type (FVB) mice, we wished to establish the essential role of Mas receptors in mediating the endothelium-dependent relaxation response induced by relaxation factors from PVAT.MAIN METHODS: Thoracic aortic rings from K/O and FVB mice were prepared with or without PVAT (PVAT+ and PVAT-) and/or intact endothelium (E+) or with the endothelium removed (E-) for functional studies. The contraction and relaxation responses of these vessels to agonist in the presence of different receptor antagonists were studied.KEY FINDINGS: PVAT attenuated the contraction induced by phenylephrine (PHE) in the presence of endothelium only in vessels from FVB mice. Mas receptor antagonists D-Ala-Ang-(1-7) (A779) or D-Pro(7)-Ang-(1-7) enhanced the contraction induced by PHE only in vessels from FVB mice. Ang-(1-7) caused a relaxation response only in E+vessels from FVB mice. Transfer of donor solution from PVAT+ vessels to PVAT- recipient vessels caused a relaxation response among FVB vessels and not among vessels from K/O mice.SIGNIFICANCE: Mas receptors are essential in mediating the endothelium-dependent relaxation response induced by PVAT, therefore highlighting the important role of Ang-(1-7) in the control of vascular functions through PVAT.</p>

<p>When adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are retrieved from the stromal vascular portion of adipose tissue, a large amount of mature adipocytes are often discarded. However, by modified ceiling culture technique based on their buoyancy, mature adipocytes can be easily isolated from the adipose cell suspension and dedifferentiated into lipid-free fibroblast-like cells, named dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells. DFAT cells re-establish active proliferation ability and undertake multipotent capacities. Compared with ASCs and other adult stem cells, DFAT cells showed unique advantages in their abundance, isolation and homogeneity. In this concise review, the establishment and culture methods of DFAT cells are introduced and the current profiles of their cellular nature are summarized. Under proper induction culture in vitro or environment in vivo, DFAT cells could demonstrate adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic and myogenic potentials. In angiogenic conditions, DFAT cells could exhibit perivascular characteristics and elicit neovascularization. Our preliminary findings also suggested the pericyte phenotype underlying such cell lineage, which supported a novel interpretation about the common origin of mesenchymal stem cells and tissue-specific stem cells within blood vessel walls. Current research on DFAT cells indicated that this alternative source of adult multipotent cells has great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p>

<p>Thoracic perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a unique adipose depot that likely influences vascular function and susceptibility to pathogenesis in obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Surprisingly, PVAT has been reported to share characteristics of both brown and white adipose, but a detailed direct comparison to interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) has not been performed. Here we show by full genome DNA microarray analysis that global gene expression profiles of PVAT are virtually identical to BAT, with equally high expression of Ucp-1, Cidea, and other genes known to be uniquely or very highly expressed in BAT. PVAT and BAT also displayed nearly identical phenotypes upon immunohistochemical analysis, and electron microscopy confirmed that PVAT contained multilocular lipid droplets and abundant mitochondria. Compared with white adipose tissue (WAT), PVAT and BAT from C57BL6/J mice fed a high-fat diet for 13 wk had markedly lower expression of immune cell-enriched mRNAs, suggesting resistance to obesity-induced inflammation. Indeed, staining of BAT and PVAT for macrophage markers (F4/80 and CD68) in obese mice showed virtually no macrophage infiltration, and FACS analysis of BAT confirmed the presence of very few CD11b(+)/CD11c(+) macrophages in BAT (1.0%) compared with WAT (31%). In summary, murine PVAT from the thoracic aorta is virtually identical to interscapular BAT, is resistant to diet-induced macrophage infiltration, and thus may play an important role in protecting the vascular bed from inflammatory stress.</p>

<p>Circulating inflammatory mediators including complement activation products participate in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. As such, previous reports demonstrating the presence of complement proteins within atherosclerotic plaque and on the luminal surface would be anticipated. In contrast, we have recently made the unexpected observation that complement proteins also deposit along the external elastic lamina of mouse aortas in the absence of luminal deposition or plaque development. This suggests that complement activation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular stiffness and atherosclerosis through a mechanism initiated within the adventitia rather than on the endothelial surface. This hypothesis was tested in the current study by ultrastructural identification of the C3- and C4-binding targets within the adventitia of the mouse aorta. The results demonstrate extensive binding of C3 and C4 to both collagen and elastin fibers within the adventitia in both ApoE(-/-) and C57Bl/6J control mice, as well as the presence of C3 and C4 within perivascular adipose tissue. These observations suggest a potential “outside-in” mechanism of vascular stiffness during which perivascular adipose may produce C3 and C4 that bind to collagen and elastin fibers within the adventitia through covalent thiolester bonds, leading to increased vascular stiffness.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue is a local deposit of adipose tissue surrounding the vasculature. Perivascular adipose tissue is present throughout the body and has been shown to have a local effect on blood vessels. The influence of perivascular adipose tissue on the vasculature changes with increasing adiposity. This article describes the anatomy and pathophysiology of perivascular adipose tissue and the experimental evidence supporting its local adverse effect on the vasculature. Methods for quantifying perivascular adipose tissue in free-living populations will be described. Finally, the epidemiological literature demonstrating an association between perivascular adipose tissue and cardiometabolic disease will be explored.</p>

<p>Being overweight or obese is a worldwide epidemic. Adiposity can cause fat mass-related cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adiposity may also cause adipocyte and adipose tissue anatomic and functional abnormalities, termed adiposopathy (adipose-opathy) or “sick fat,” that result in endocrine and immune derangements. Adiposopathy may directly contribute to CVD through pericardiac and perivascular effects on the myocardium and blood vessels. Adiposopathy may also indirectly contribute to CVD through promoting or worsening major CVD risk factors such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. Despite CVD being the most common cause of mortality among overweight individuals, the pathophysiologic relationship between adiposity and CVD is often thought mysterious, as evidenced by “obesity paradoxes.” Underlying this uncertainty are suggestions that excessive body fat does not always increase the risk of CVD and, in some cases, may actually decrease such risks. These paradoxical findings are made less paradoxical when the pathogenic potential of excessive body fat is assessed based on adipose tissue dysfunction rather than simply on increased fat mass alone. This introductory review 1) provides a brief historical perspective of the pathogenic potential of adipose tissue; 2) describes the relationships between adipose tissue (histology, embryology, and adipogenesis) and cardiovascular medicine; 3) outlines the anatomic, functional, endocrine, and immune manifestations of adiposopathy; and 4) describes the importance of cross talk and/or interactions of adipose tissue with other body tissues. Finally, this review describes how “sick fat” helps account for various clinical obesity/cardiovascular paradoxes, supporting adiposopathy as a cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Recent research has shown that adipose tissues contain abundant MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells). The origin and location of the adipose stem cells, however, remain unknown, presenting an obstacle to the further purification and study of these cells. In the present study, we aimed at investigating the origins of adipose stem cells. a-SMA (a-smooth muscle actin) is one of the markers of pericytes. We harvested ASCs (adipose stromal cells) from a-SMA-GFP (green fluorescent protein) transgenic mice and sorted them into GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells by FACS. Multilineage differentiation tests were applied to examine the pluripotent ability of the a-SMA-GFP-positive and -negative cells. Immunofluorescent staining for a-SMA and PDGF-Rß (platelet-derived growth factor receptor ß) were applied to identify the a-SMA-GFP-positive cells. Then a-SMA-GFP-positive cells were loaded on a collagen-fibronectin gel with endothelial cells to test their vascularization ability both in vitro and in vivo. Results show that, in adipose tissue, all of the a-SMA-GFP-positive cells congregate around the blood vessels. Only the a-SMA-GFP-positive cells have multilineage differentiation ability, while the a-SMA-GFP-negative cells can only differentiate in an adipogenic direction. The a-SMA-GFP-positive cells maintained expression of a-SMA during multilineage differentiation. The a-SMA-GFP-positive cells can promote the vascularization of endothelial cells in three-dimensional culture both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the adipose stem cells originate from perivascular cells and congregate around blood vessels.</p>

<p>Major traumatic injuries to the body, such as large surface area burns, limit the availability of autologous stem cell populations for wound repair. This report demonstrates that even after severe burn trauma to the body, resident stem cells present within the subcutaneous adipose tissue survive and are available for therapeutic uses. Debrided skin from wounded areas contains subcutaneous adipose tissue and can yield approximately 1.5 × 10(5) to 2.5 × 10(5) cells per milliliter of tissue. This observation indicates that tissue, which is normally discarded, could be a valuable source of stem cells. Initial immunohistochemistry of the debrided tissue localized platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta(+) (PDGFR-ß(+) ) cells to perivascular niches of vascular beds. It was immunophenotypically confirmed that the cell isolates are stem cells and designated as debrided skin adipose-derived stem cells (dsASCs). Gene expression analysis of stem cell specific transcripts showed that the dsASCs maintained their stemness over serial passages. Furthermore, dsASCs were able to differentiate into adipogenic, osteogenic, and vascular cell lineages. Finally, an in vivo excision wound model in athymic rats demonstrated that the dsASCs are engrafted within a wound bed after 12 days. These data provide the first evidence that subcutaneous adipose tissue from discarded burned skin contains a viable population of stem cells that can be used for wound repair and skin regenerative therapies.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Although inflammation within adipose tissues is known to play a role in metabolic syndrome, the causative connection between inflamed adipose tissue and atherosclerosis is not fully understood. In the present study, we examined the direct effects of adipose tissue on macro-vascular inflammation using intravital microscopic analysis of the femoral artery after adipose tissue transplantation.METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained subcutaneous (SQ) and visceral (VIS) adipose tissues from C57BL/6 mice fed normal chow (NC) or a high fat diet (HF), then transplanted the tissues into the perivascular area of the femoral artery of recipient C57/BL6 mice. Quantitative intravital microscopic analysis revealed an increase in adherent leukocytes after adipose tissue transplantation, with VIS found to induce significantly more leukocyte accumulation as compared to SQ. Moreover, adipose tissues from HF fed mice showed significantly more adhesion to the femoral artery. Simultaneous flow cytometry demonstrated upregulation of CD11b on peripheral granulocyte and monocytes after adipose tissue transplantation. We also observed dominant expressions of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, and chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1ß in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of these adipose tissues as well as sera of recipient mice after transplantation. Finally, massive accumulations of pro-inflammatory and dendritic cells were detected in mice with VIS transplantation as compared to SQ, as well as in HF mice as compared to those fed NC.CONCLUSION: Our in vivo findings indicate that adipose tissue stimulates leukocyte accumulation in the femoral artery. The underlying mechanisms involve upregulation of CD11b in leukocytes, induction of cytokines and chemokines, and accumulation of pro-inflammatory cells in the SVF.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We hypothesized that proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2)-mediated vasorelaxation in murine aorta tissue can be due in part to the release of adipocyte-derived relaxing factors (ADRFs).EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Aortic rings from obese TallyHo and C57Bl6 intact or PAR2-null mice either without or with perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) were contracted with phenylephrine and relaxation responses to PAR2-selective activating peptides (PAR2-APs: SLIGRL-NH(2) and 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2) ), trypsin and to PAR2-inactive peptides (LRGILS-NH(2) , 2-furoyl-OLRGIL-NH(2) and LSIGRL-NH(2) ) were measured. Relaxation was monitored in the absence or presence of inhibitors that either alone or in combination were previously shown to inhibit ADRF-mediated responses: L-NAME (NOS), indomethacin (COX), ODQ (guanylate cyclase), catalase (H(2) O(2) ) and the K(+) channel-targeted reagents, apamin, charybdotoxin, 4-aminopyridine and glibenclamide.KEY RESULTS: Endothelium-intact PVAT-free preparations did not respond to PAR2-inactive peptides (LRGILS-NH(2) , LSIGRL-NH(2) , 2-furoyl-OLRGIL-NH(2) ), whereas active PAR2-APs (SLIGRL-NH(2) ; 2-furoyl-LIGRLO-NH(2) ) caused an L-NAME-inhibited relaxation. However, in PVAT-containing preparations treated with L-NAME/ODQ/indomethacin together, both PAR2-APs and trypsin caused relaxant responses in PAR2-intact, but not PAR2-null-derived tissues. The PAR2-induced PVAT-dependent relaxation (SLIGRL-NH(2) ) persisted in the presence of apamin plus charybdotoxin, 4-aminopyridine and glibenclamide, but was blocked by catalase, implicating a role for H(2) O(2) . Surprisingly, the PAR2-inactive peptides, LRGILS-NH(2) and 2-furoyl-OLRGIL-NH(2) (but not LSIGRL-NH(2) ), caused relaxation in PVAT-containing preparations from both PAR2-null and PAR2-intact (C57Bl, TallyHo) mice. The LRGILS-NH(2) -induced relaxation was distinct from the PAR2 response, being blocked by 4-aminopyridine, but not catalase.CONCLUSIONS: Distinct ADRFs that may modulate vascular tone in pathophysiological settings can be released from murine PVAT by both PAR2-dependent and PAR2-independent mechanisms.</p>

<p>The search for novel sources of stem cells other than bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for bone regeneration and repair has been a critical endeavor. We previously established an effective protocol to homogeneously purify human pericytes from multiple fetal and adult tissues, including adipose, bone marrow, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and identified pericytes as a primitive origin of human MSCs. In the present study, we further characterized the osteogenic potential of purified human pericytes combined with a novel osteoinductive growth factor, Nell-1. Purified pericytes grown on either standard culture ware or human cancellous bone chip (hCBC) scaffolds exhibited robust osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Using a nude mouse muscle pouch model, pericytes formed significant new bone in vivo as compared to scaffold alone (hCBC). Moreover, Nell-1 significantly increased pericyte osteogenic differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, Nell-1 significantly induced pericyte proliferation and was observed to have pro-angiogenic effects, both in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that pericytes are a potential new cell source for future efforts in skeletal regenerative medicine, and that Nell-1 is a candidate growth factor able to induce pericyte osteogenic differentiation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Adipose stem cells represent a heterogenous population. Understanding the functional characteristics of subpopulations will be useful in developing adipose stem cell-based therapies for regenerative medicine applications. The aim of this study was to define distinct populations within the stromal vascular fraction based on surface marker expression, and to evaluate the ability of each cell type to differentiate to mature adipocytes.METHODS: Subcutaneous whole adipose tissue was obtained by abdominoplasty from human patients. The stromal vascular fraction was separated and four cell populations were isolated by flow cytometry and studied. Candidate perivascular cells (pericytes) were defined as CD146(+)/CD31(-)/CD34(-). Two CD31(+) endothelial populations were detected and differentiated by CD34 expression. These were tentatively designated as mature endothelial (CD31(+)/CD34(-)), and immature endothelial (CD31(+)/CD34(+)). Both endothelial populations were heterogeneous with respect to CD146. The CD31(-)/CD34(+) fraction (preadipocyte candidate) was also CD90(+) but lacked CD146 expression.RESULTS: Proliferation was greatest in the CD31(-)/CD34(+) group and slowest in the CD146 group. Expression of adipogenic genes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<U+03B3>, and fatty acid binding protein 4, were significantly higher in the CD31(-)/CD34(+) group compared with all other populations after in vitro adipogenic differentiation. This group also demonstrated the highest proportion of AdipoRed lipid staining.CONCLUSIONS: The authors have isolated four distinct stromal populations from human adult adipose tissue and characterized their adipogenic potential. Of these four populations, the CD31/CD34(+) group is the most prevalent and has the greatest potential for adipogenic differentiation. This cell type appears to hold the most promise for adipose tissue engineering.</p>

<p>Fat cells or adipocytes are distributed ubiquitously throughout the body and are often regarded purely as energy stores. However, recently it has become clear that these adipocytes are engine rooms producing large numbers of metabolically active substances with both endocrine and paracrine actions. White adipocytes surround almost every blood vessel in the human body and are collectively termed perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). It is now well recognized that PVAT not only provides mechanical support for any blood vessels it invests, but also secretes vasoactive and metabolically essential cytokines known as adipokines, which regulate vascular function. The emergence of obesity as a major challenge to our healthcare systems has contributed to the growing interest in adipocyte dysfunction with a view to discovering new pharmacotherapeutic agents to help rescue compromised PVAT function. Very few PVAT studies have been carried out on human tissue. This review will discuss these and the hypotheses generated from such research, as well as highlight the most significant and clinically relevant animal studies showing the most pharmacological promise.</AbstractText>: Fat cells or adipocytes are distributed ubiquitously throughout the body and are often regarded purely as energy stores.

<p>Adipose tissue is an active endocrine and paracrine organ that may influence the development of atherosclerosis and vascular disease. In the setting of obesity, adipose tissue produces a variety of inflammatory cytokines (or adipokines) that are known to modulate key mechanisms of atherogenesis. In particular, adipose tissue located on the surface of the heart surrounding large coronary arteries (i.e. epicardial perivascular adipose tissue) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. The present review outlines our current understanding of the cellular and molecular links between perivascular adipose tissue and atherosclerosis with a focus on potential mechanisms by which epicardial perivascular adipose tissue contributes to obesity-related coronary disease. The pathophysiology of perivascular adipose tissue in obesity and its influence on oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and vascular reactivity is addressed. In addition, the contribution of specific epicardial perivascular adipose-derived adipokines (e.g. leptin, adiponectin) to the initiation and expansion of coronary disease is also highlighted. Finally, future investigative goals are discussed with an emphasis on indentifying novel therapeutic targets and disease markers within perivascular adipose tissue.</AbstractText>: Adipose tissue is an active endocrine and paracrine organ that may influence the development of atherosclerosis and vascular disease.

<p>BACKGROUND: Propofol causes hypotension due to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells through its direct or indirect vasodilator effects. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and endothelium attenuate vascular contraction, and the function of PVAT is altered in hypertension and diabetes. Whether PVAT affects the action of anesthetics on vascular function is unknown. We studied the mechanisms of propofol-induced relaxation in relation to the involvement of PVAT and endothelium.METHODS: Thoracic aortic rings from Wistar rats were prepared with or without PVAT (PVAT+ and PVAT-), intact endothelium (E+), or both, or with the endothelium removed (E-) for functional studies.RESULTS: In phenylephrine precontracted vessels, propofol-induced relaxation was highest with both PVAT and E+ and lowest in vessels denuded of both PVAT and endothelium. Propofol-induced relaxation occurred via both endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The relaxation response induced by propofol was significantly reduced by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (l-NNA), K(+) channel blockers (tetraethylammonium and glibenclamide) in E+ and E- vessels, and by soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo (4,3-A) quinazoline-1-one and hydrogen peroxide scavenger (catalase) in E- vessels. The presence of PVAT significantly enhanced the relaxation response induced by propofol. In contrast to phenylephrine precontracted vessels in which the presence of PVAT or endothelium had an effect, in vessels precontracted with KCl, propofol-induced relaxation was similar among the 4 types of vessel preparation.CONCLUSIONS: PVAT enhances the relaxation effect induced by propofol in rat aorta through both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent pathways thus highlighting the clinical importance of PVAT.</p>

<p>Myocardial fat content refers to the storage of triglyceride droplets within cardiomyocytes. In addition, the heart and arteries are surrounded by layers of adipose tissue, exerting vasocrine and paracrine control of the subtending tissues. The rapid development of the field of noninvasive imaging has made it possible to quantify ectopic fat masses and contents with an increasing degree of accuracy. Myocardial triglyceride stores are increased in obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes. The role of intramyocardial triglyceride accumulation in the pathogenesis of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction remains unclear. Increased triglyceride content is associated with states of fatty acid overload to the heart, saturating the oxidative capacity. It may initially serve as a fatty acid sink to circumscribe the formation of toxic lipid species and subsequently foster cardiac damage. Epicardial and perivascular fat depots may exert a protective modulation of vascular function and energy partition in a healthy situation, but their expansion turns them into an adverse lipotoxic, prothrombotic, and proinflammatory organ. They are augmented in patients with metabolic disorders and coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the progressive association between the quantity of fat and disease severity in terms of extent of plaque calcification or noncalcified areas, markers of plaque vulnerability, and number of vessels involved is less confirmed. Functional or hybrid imaging may contribute to a better definition of disease severity and unveil the direct myocardial and vascular targets of adipose tissue action.</p>

<p>Visceral fat has been linked to metabolic disturbances and increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Recent studies propose a paracrine role for periadventitial adipose tissue in the control of arterial vascular tone. This regulation depends on the anatomical integrity of the vessels and involves a transferable mediator(s) (adipokine) released from either periadventitial adipocytes or perivascular adipose tissue. Although a number of adipokines with vasoactive properties have been identified, a still unidentified adipocyte-derived relaxing factor (ADRF) plays a major role in the periadventitial vasoregulation of visceral arteries, such as the aorta and mesenteric arteries. ADRF is released by visceral periadventitial adipocytes and primarily produces endothelium-independent vasorelaxation by opening voltage-dependent (K(v) ) K(+) channels in the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells. At least in part, KCNQ (K(v) 7) channels could represent the subtype of K(v) channels involved. Glibenclamide-sensitive K(ATP) channels are not involved or play a minor role. The ‘third gas’, namely H(2) S, could represent ADRF. Alterations in the paracrine control of arterial tone by visceral periadventitial adipose tissue have been found in animal models of hypertension and metabolic disease. ADRF, or perhaps its putative targets, might represent exciting new targets for the development of drugs for treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.</AbstractText>: Visceral fat has been linked to metabolic disturbances and increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

<p>Adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ, producing various adipokines and many other substances. Almost all blood vessels are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which has not received research attention until recently. This review will discuss the paracrine actions of PVAT on the growth of underlying vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). PVAT can release growth factors and inhibitors. Visfatin is the first identified growth factor derived from PVAT. Decreased adiponectin and increased tumour necrosis factor-a in PVAT play a pathological role for neointimal hyperplasia after endovascular injury. PVAT-derived angiotensin II, angiotensin 1-7, reactive oxygen species, complement component 3, NO and H(2) S have a paracrine action on VSMC contraction, endothelial or fibroblast function; however, their paracrine actions on VSMC growth remain to be directly verified. Factors such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, leptin, resistin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1, adrenomedullin, free fatty acids, glucocorticoids and sex hormones can be released from adipose tissue and can regulate VSMC growth. Most of them have been verified for their secretion by PVAT; however, their paracrine functions are unknown. Obesity, vascular injury, aging and infection may affect PVAT, causing adipocyte abnormality and inflammatory cell infiltration, inducing imbalance of PVAT-derived growth factors and inhibitors, leading to VSMC growth and finally resulting in development of proliferative vascular disease, including atherosclerosis, restenosis and hypertension. In the future, using cell-specific gene interventions and local treatments may provide definitive evidence for identification of key factor(s) involved in PVAT dysfunction-induced vascular disease and thus may help to develop new therapies.</AbstractText>: Adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ, producing various adipokines and many other substances.

<p>Obesity is associated with insulin resistance, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms underlying these associations are incompletely understood. Microvascular dysfunction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of both insulin resistance and hypertension in obesity. Adipose tissue-derived substances (adipokines) and especially inflammatory products of adipose tissue control insulin sensitivity and vascular function. In the past years, adipose tissue associated with the vasculature, or perivascular adipose tissue (PAT), has been shown to produce a variety of adipokines that contribute to regulation of vascular tone and local inflammation. This review describes our current understanding of the mechanisms linking perivascular adipose tissue to vascular function, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, we will discuss mechanisms controlling the quantity and adipokines secretion by PAT.</p>

<p>Obesity is rising worldwide at an alarming rate and so is the incidence of obesity-related disorders, such as the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The obesity-dependent vascular damage appears to be derived from a variety of changes in the adipose tissue, leading to a chronic inflammatory state and dysregulation of adipocyte-derived factors. This, in turn, impairs vascular homeostasis by determining an unbalance between the protective effect of the nitric oxide pathway and the unfavourable action of the endothelin-1 system. In addition, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance contribute to vascular dysfunction because the opposing endothelium-dependent vasodilating and vasoconstrictor effects of insulin are shifted towards a predominant vasoconstriction in patients with obesity. Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that the vascular dysfunction of obesity is not only limited to the endothelium but also involves the other layers of the vessel wall. In particular, obesity-related changes in vascular smooth muscle seem to disrupt the physiological facilitatory action of insulin on the responsiveness to vasodilator stimuli, whereas the adventitia and the perivascular fat appear to be a source of proinflammatory and vasoactive factors that may contribute to endothelial and smooth muscle cell dysfunction and to the pathogenesis of vascular disease.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The functional significance of myocardial bridging remains controversial. The bridge morphology and structure of the tunneled vessels may modify its ultimate clinical effects.OBJECTIVE: To describe the morphological characteristics of myocardial bridges and their influence on coronary histology.DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study.METHODS: One hundred and nine formalin-fixed adult hearts were evaluated by dissection for these data: prevalence, site, lengths and depths of myocardial bridges. Vessel segments proximal and distal to the bridged portion were also processed for histology and stained to elaborate smooth muscle, collagen and elastic fibers. Stereology was also employed to compare the relative sizes of the tunica intima and the vessel wall to lumen ratios.RESULTS: Myocardial bridges were found in 40.4% of the hearts, most commonly in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The average length of the bridges was 22.66 +11.94 mm while the depth was 1.83+ 0.98mm, with only 11% being long (34.87mm - 50mm) and 9% of them being deep (3.46mm - 5.00mm). The tunica intima was thickest proximal to and thinnest under the myocardial bridge. The intima of the proximal segment was also more elastic. An elaborate perivascular ‘cushion’ of adipose tissue intervened between the intramural coronary and the surrounding myocardium.CONCLUSIONS: Most myocardial bridges are superficial and short. Tunica intima under myocardial bridges is spared from “atherogenesis”. The thick perivascular space around the bridged segment may protect it from extreme compression.</p>

<p>Pathological analysis of renal biopsies performed to investigate a nephrological disease may exceptionally reveal incidental tumours, in addition to expected glomerular, tubulointerstitial or vascular pathology. We present the first case to date of a minute angiomyolipoma (AML), found incidentally in a renal biopsy specimen, performed in the assessment of proteinuria. AML is an uncommon kidney tumour, composed of a variable proportion of adipose tissue, spindle and epithelioid smooth muscle cells. Immunohistochemistry is mandatory for a definitive diagnosis, showing a specific perivascular epithelioid differentiation. The diagnosis of renal AML justifies the search for tuberous sclerosis-associated tumours.</p>

<p>Perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) neoplasms are an unusual group of mesenchymal tumors thought to arise from the PEC, which characteristically expresses melanocytic markers with common coexpression of muscle markers. They show a wide morphologic spectrum and have been described in multiple anatomical locations, including the uterus. We report a 59-year-old woman with tuberous sclerosis, initially diagnosed with a uterine malignant mixed müllerian tumor, in whom the hysterectomy specimen also showed 3 other incidental tumors: a subserosal angiomyolipoma consisting of blood vessels of varying caliber, mature adipose tissue, and nests of spindle cells arranged in a perivascular location, a sclerosing PEComa consisting of small nests of clear epithelioid cells present in a background of marked sclerosis centered in the lower uterine segment/endocervix, and diffuse lymphangiomyomatosis involving the endocervix, lower uterine segment, and uterine corpus. This case provides further evidence of a common precursor cell of origin for these lesions.</p>

<p>We studied the structural and the functional alterations of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in hypertension with spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a smaller body fat mass and a greater lean mass were found in SHR than in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, while body weight was comparable between them. In the thoracic PVAT, the density and the total number of brown adipocytes were greater in SHR than in WKY rats, while the cross section area of PVAT was similar between them. In functional assessment, four types of vessel preparations (with either intact PVAT or intact endothelium, or with both, or without both) were employed. Vessels with intact PVAT from SHR contracted more to phenylephrine than that from WKY rats, while vessels without PVAT exhibited comparable contractile response to phenylephrine between SHR and WKY rats. Both endothelium-dependent and -independent components of PVAT-associated attenuation of phenylephrine-induced contraction were reduced in SHR as compared with that of WKY rats. Bioassay experiments were carried out to assess the transferable relaxation factor from the PVAT. Transfer of bathing solution incubated with PVAT-intact vessel caused less relaxation in SHR recipients than in WKY rats, and the relaxation response was abolished by D-Ala(7)-angiotensin-(1-7), an angiotensin-(1-7) receptor antagonist. In summary, PVAT-associated inhibition of vessel contractile response to agonist was impaired in SHR, and the impairment involved both endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The functional impairment observed in SHR PVAT may be related to changes in adipocyte composition but not to reduced PVAT mass in SHR.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether macrophages dispersed throughout perivascular fat are crucial to the loss of anticontractile function when healthy adipose tissue becomes inflamed and to gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved.METHODS AND RESULTS: Pharmacological studies on in vitro small arterial segments from a mouse model of inducible macrophage ablation and on wild-type animals were carried out with and without perivascular fat using 2 physiological stimuli of inflammation: aldosterone and hypoxia. Both inflammatory insults caused a similar loss of anticontractile capacity of perivascular fat and increased macrophage activation. Aldosterone receptor antagonism and free radical scavengers were able to restore this capacity and reduce macrophage activation. However, in a mouse deficient of macrophages CD11b-diptheria toxin receptor (CD11b-DTR), there was no increase in contractility of arteries following aldosterone incubation or hypoxia.CONCLUSIONS: The presence and activation of macrophages in adipose tissue is the key modulator of the increase in contractility in arteries with perivascular fat following induction of inflammation. Despite multiple factors that may be involved in bringing about the vascular consequences of obesity, the ability of eplerenone to ameliorate the inflammatory effects of both aldosterone and hypoxia may be of potential therapeutic interest.</p>

<p>Although a number of studies have shown that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) attenuates arterial contraction through the release of perivascular-derived relaxation factors (PVRF), the role of PVAT in modulating venous function and its mechanism(s) remained unknown. Here we examined the role of PVAT in the modulation of vascular function in the inferior vena cava. Venous rings from male Wistar rats were prepared with both endothelium and PVAT intact, with either PVAT or endothelium removed, or with both endothelium and PVAT removed for functional studies. Contractile response to phenylephrine, U 46619, or 5-hydroxytryptamine was significantly attenuated in PVAT+ as compared with PVAT- veins. PVAT- vessels with intact endothelium (E+) pre-contracted with phenylephrine showed a concentration-dependent relaxation response to angiotensin 1-7 [Ang-(1-7)], and this response was abolished by the removal of endothelium, and by Ang-(1-7) (Mas) receptor antagonists D-Ala-Ang-(1-7) (A779) or D-Pro(7)-Ang-(1-7). Donor solution incubated with a PVAT+ ring induced a relaxation response in the E+ recipient vessel but not in E- recipient vessel. The use of specific channel blockers and enzyme inhibitors showed that Ang-(1-7) is a transferable PVRF that induces endothelium-dependent relaxation through NO release and activation of voltage-dependent potassium (K(+)) channels (K(v)) channels. We conclude that venous PVAT attenuates agonist-induced contraction by releasing Ang-(1-7), which causes relaxation of smooth muscle through endothelial NO release and activation of K(v) channels.</p>

<li>Obesity is a metabolic disease of pandemic proportions largely arising from positive energy balance, a consequence of sedentary lifestyle, conditioned by environmental and genetic factors. Several central and peripheral neurohumoral factors (the major ones being the anorectic adipokines leptin and adiponecin and the orexigenic gut hormone ghrelin) acting on the anorectic (pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) and orexigenic (neuropeptide Y and agouti gene-related protein) neurons regulate energy balance. These neurons, mainly in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, project to parts of the brain modulating functions such as wakefulness, autonomic function and learning. A tilt in the anorectic-orexigenic balance, perhaps determined genetically, leads to obesity. 2. Excess fat deposition requires space, created by adipocyte (hypertrophy and hyperplasia) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. This process is regulated by several factors, including several adipocyte-derived Matrix metalloproteinases and the adipokine cathepsin, which degrades fibronectin, a key ECM protein. Excess fat, also deposited in visceral organs, generates chronic low-grade inflammation that eventually triggers insulin resistance and the associated comorbidities of metabolic syndrome (hypertension, atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus). 3. The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has conventionally been considered non-physiological structural tissue, but has recently been shown to serve a paracrine function, including the release of adipose-derived relaxant and contractile factors, akin to the role of the vascular endothelium. Thus, PVAT regulates vascular function in vivo and in vitro, contributing to the cardiovascular pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome. Defining the mechanism of PVAT regulation of vascular reactivity requires more and better controlled investigations than currently seen in the literature.</li>

<p>Peripheral adipose tissue contains a population of clonogenic precursor cells referred to as adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) that retain the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell types including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes, and neuronal cells following ex vivo expansion. Recent studies have demonstrated that ASC are most likely derived from a perivascular niche within highly vascularised fat tissue, analogous to different mesenchymal cell populations identified in other tissues throughout the body. The following chapter describes techniques to prospectively isolate clonogenic ASC from adult human adipose tissue using antibodies directed against perivascular markers and methods to immunophenotypically characterize their ex vivo expanded progeny.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is a critical regulator of vascular function, which until recently had been virtually ignored. Almost all blood vessels are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue, which is actively involved in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis by producing “vasocrine” signals such as adipokines. Adiponectin and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP), both of which are major adipokines predominantly produced in adipose tissue, have recently been shown to be pivotal modulators of vascular function. Adiponectin has multiple beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. It prevents obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction by inducing nitric oxide production, suppressing endothelial cell activation, inhibiting reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, and promoting endothelial cell repair. By contrast, A-FABP plays a detrimental role in vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis, mainly by acting as a lipid sensor to transmit toxic lipids-induced vascular inflammation through induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Decreased production of adiponectin and/or elevated expression of A-FABP are important contributors to the pathogenesis of obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. This chapter highlights recent advances in both clinical investigations and animal studies promoting the understanding of the roles of adiponectin and A-FABP in the modulation of vascular function, and discusses the possibilities of using these two adipokines as therapeutic targets to design new drugs for preventing vascular disease associated with obesity and diabetes.</p>

<p>Perivascular tissue (PVT) surrounding many blood vessels, including those used as bypass conduits, is the source of adipocyte-derived relaxing factors, one of which is leptin. Here, we assessed leptin levels and identified leptin localization in the cushion of fat surrounding ‘no-touch-harvested’ saphenous veins (SVs) used as grafts in 15 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Leptin protein was identified in perivascular fat (PVF) extracts by Western blot analysis and leptin levels were 2.2 (0.5-4.2) ng/mg protein [mean (range), n=10] as assessed by ELISA. There was dense leptin immunostaining of fat and adipocyte membranes surrounding these no-touch SV grafts. PVT-derived factors are suggested to play an important role in the superior patency rate of the internal thoracic artery used as a bypass graft. Our findings suggest that, as a potent vasodilator, PVF-derived leptin may also play an important role both at harvesting and in the improved long-term performance of no-touch SVs in patients undergoing CABG.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a new gasotransmitter synthesized enzymatically from l-cysteine in cytosol and is oxidized in mitochondria. In the cardiovascular system, H(2)S regulates vascular tone, inhibits atherogenesis, and protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. We examined the effect of statins on vascular H(2)S production. Male Wistar rats received pravastatin (40mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin (20mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks and then H(2)S formation was measured in aortic media, periaortic adipose tissue (PAAT) and the liver. Only atorvastatin increased H(2)S production in PAAT whereas both statins stimulated its formation in the liver. Neither statin affected H(2)S production in aortic media. H(2)S formation in post-mitochondrial supernatant was higher than in mitochondria-containing supernatant and was not influenced by statins in any tissue. In addition, oxidation of exogenous H(2)S in isolated liver mitochondria was slower in statin-treated than in control rats. These data indicate that statins increase net H(2)S production by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation. Statins had no effect on the activity of H(2)S-metabolizing enzyme, sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, measured at saturating coenzyme Q concentration. Both statins reduced CoQ(9) concentration in plasma and liver, but only atorvastatin decreased CoQ(9) in PAAT. Atorvastatin attenuated phenylephrine-induced contraction of PAAT+ but not of PAAT- aortic rings. Effects of atorvastatin on net H(2)S production, mitochondrial H(2)S oxidation and aortic contractility were abolished by supplementation of exogenous CoQ(9). In conclusion, lipophilic atorvastatin, but not hydrophilic pravastatin, increases net H(2)S production in perivascular adipose tissue by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation. This effect is mediated by statin-induced CoQ(9) deficiency and results in the augmentation of anticontractile effect of perivascular adipose tissue.</p>

<p>AIM: To test the early effect of fructose-induced changes in fatty acid composition and oxidative stress markers in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) upon vascular contractility.METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were fed a commercial diet without (CD) or with 10% fructose (FRD) in the drinking water for 3 weeks. We measured plasma metabolic parameters, lipid composition and oxidative stress markers in aortic PVAT. Vascular contractility was measured in aortic rings sequentially, stimulated with serotonin (5-HT) and high K+-induced depolarization using intact and thereafter PVAT-deprived rings.RESULTS: Comparable body weights were recorded in both groups. FRD rats had increased plasma triglyceride and fructosamine levels. Their PVAT had an increased saturated to mono- or poly-unsaturated fatty acid ratio, a significant decrease in total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and in the total content of glutathione. Conversely, lipid peroxidation (TBARS), nitric oxide content, and gluthathione reductase activity were significantly higher, indicating an increase in oxidative stress. In aortic rings, removal of PVAT increased serotonin-induced contractions, but the effect was significantly lower in rings from FRD rats. This effect was no longer observed when the two contractions were performed in PVAT-deprived rings. PVAT did not affect the contractions triggered by high K+-induced depolarization either in CD or FRD rats.CONCLUSIONS: FRD induces multiple metabolic and endocrine systemic alterations which also alter PVAT and the vascular relaxant properties of this tissue. The changes in PVAT would affect its paracrine modulation of vascular function.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)-derived factors in the regulation of adventitial fibroblast (AF) function in vitro and in vivo.METHODS AND RESULTS: PVAT is an active component of blood vessels. Bioactive substances released from PVAT play regulatory roles in vascular function. However, their effects on vascular AFs remain unclear. PVAT-conditioned medium stimulated AF migration using a transwell technique, and differentiation was evaluated by a-smooth muscle-actin induction. We identified the secretome of PVAT by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. One of the major secretory proteins in PVAT is complement 3 (C3). The C3 antagonist and neutralizing antibody attenuated PVAT-conditioned medium-induced AF migration and differentiation. Similar to PVAT-conditioned medium, C3 recombinant protein stimulated AF migration and differentiation. We demonstrated that the effects of PVAT-derived C3 were mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Moreover, we found morphological changes in perivascular adipocytes and increased expression of C3 in PVAT that was tightly associated with adventitial thickening and myofibroblast clustering around PVAT in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats.CONCLUSIONS: PVAT-derived C3 stimulated AF migration and differentiation via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. PVAT-derived C3 may contribute to adventitial remodeling in a deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive model.</p>

<p>Obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, are characterized by expansion and inflammation of adipose tissue, including the depots surrounding the heart and the blood vessels. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a visceral thoracic fat depot located along the large coronary arteries and on the surface of the ventricles and the apex of the heart, whereas perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounds the arteries. Both fat depots are not separated by a fascia from the underlying tissue. Therefore, factors secreted from epicardial and PVAT, like free fatty acids and adipokines, can directly affect the function of the heart and blood vessels. In this review, we describe the alterations found in EAT and PVAT in pathological states like obesity, type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome and coronary artery disease. Furthermore, we discuss how changes in adipokine expression and secretion associated with these pathological states could contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac contractile and vascular dysfunction.</p>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is still a major cause of chronic graft failure. CAV develops in the coronary arteries as a diffuse, concentric expansion of the intima in conjunction with inflammation and fibrosis of the adventitia. We review recent publications that could link metabolic and immunologic risk factors for CAV.A concept is offered that periarterial adipocytes may provide proinflammatory cytokines that augment immune injury of the coronary arteries.RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical and experimental evidence indicate that some alloantibodies and autoantibodies are associated with CAV. Limited data are available on the expression of target antigens on coronary arteries at different times after transplantation. Perivascular adipose tissue is an abundant source of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. Adding to the inflammatory bias, perivascular adipocytes secrete less of the anti-inflammatory adiponectin in comparison to other types of fat. Adiponectin modulates expression of adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium. It also decreases neointimal formation in arteries following mechanical endovascular injury.SUMMARY: Alterations in the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by perivascular fat have been implicated in atherosclerosis and restenosis. This imbalance may also augment the immune responses in the coronary arteries of transplanted hearts.</p>

<p>Stem cell niches are composed of numerous microenvironmental features, including soluble and insoluble factors, cues from other cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), which collectively serve to maintain stem cell quiescence and promote their ability to support tissue homeostasis. A hallmark of many adult stem cell niches is their proximity to the vasculature in vivo, a feature common to neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow and adipose tissue, hematopoietic stem cells, and many tumor stem cells. In this study, we describe a novel 3D microfluidic device (MFD) as a model system in which to study the molecular regulation of perivascular stem cell niches. Endothelial cells (ECs) suspended within 3D fibrin gels patterned in the device adjacent to stromal cells (either fibroblasts or bone marrow-derived MSCs) executed a morphogenetic process akin to vasculogenesis, forming a primitive vascular plexus and maturing into a robust capillary network with hollow well-defined lumens. Both MSCs and fibroblasts formed pericytic associations with the ECs but promoted capillary morphogenesis with distinct kinetics. Biochemical assays within the niche revealed that the perivascular association of MSCs required interaction between their a6ß1 integrin receptor and EC-deposited laminin. These studies demonstrate the potential of this physiologically relevant ex vivo model system to study how proximity to blood vessels may influence stem cell multipotency.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue surrounds (coronary) arteries and may be involved in local stimulation of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Epicardial adipose tissue, the adipose tissue within the pericardium, is a frequently used measure of coronary perivascular adipose tissue and can be quantified with echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The quantity of (coronary) perivascular adipose tissue is correlated with parameters of the metabolic syndrome, such as increased waist circumference, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia, and with coronary atherosclerosis. Coronary artery segments covered by myocardium are not exposed to coronary perivascular adipose tissue and interestingly, atherosclerosis is absent in these intra-myocardial segments. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines are expressed and secreted at a higher level in epicardial adipose tissue of patients with coronary artery disease compared to patients without coronary artery disease. Furthermore, in vitro and ex vivo perivascular adipose tissue induces inflammation of the artery wall by secretion of pro-inflammatory proteins. Atherogenesis in the vascular wall is thus stimulated from ‘outside to inside’. Based on the results of clinical, ex vivo and in vitro studies, it can be argued that perivascular adipose tissue may be involved in the process of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue secretes an adipocyte-derived relaxing factor (ADRF) that opens voltage-dependent K (Kv) channels in peripheral arteries. We studied the role of KCNQ-type Kv channels and tested the hypothesis that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could be an ADRF.METHODS: We performed isometric contraction studies on systemic arteries of rats and mice.RESULTS: In mesenteric arteries and aortas without perivascular adipose tissue, the KCNQ channel openers retigabine, VRX0530727, VRX0621238, and VRX0621688 produced concentration-dependent vasorelaxation; VRX0621688 was the most potent vasodilator. The KCNQ inhibitor XE991 (30 micromol/l) blocked the effects of both the drugs and ADRF. Inhibitors of cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE) beta-cyano-L-alanine (BCA, 5 mmol/l) and 4-propargyl glycine (PPG, 10 mmol/l) also blocked the relaxations. CSE is expressed in perivascular adipose tissue and endogenously generates H2S. The H2S donor NaHS produced concentration-dependent vasorelaxation, which was also blocked by XE991. The vasodilatory capacities of retigabine, VRX0530727, VRX0621238, and VRX0621688 were preserved following inhibition of H2S generation in perivascular fat.CONCLUSION: We suggest that KCNQ channel opening is a powerful mechanism to produce vasorelaxation of systemic arteries in rats and mice. Furthermore, KCNQ channels play a major role in the paracrine control of vascular tone by perivascular adipose tissue, which is at least in part mediated or modulated by H2S. In conditions of reduced H2S release from perivascular adipose tissue, these paracrine effects can be mimicked by synthetic KCNQ channel openers.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Factors released by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) disrupt coronary endothelial function via phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase by protein kinase C (PKC)-beta. However, our understanding of how PVAT potentially contributes to coronary disease as a complication of obesity/metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains limited. The current study investigated whether PVAT-derived leptin impairs coronary vascular function via PKC-beta in MetS.METHODS AND RESULTS: Coronary arteries with and without PVAT were collected from lean or MetS Ossabaw miniature swine for isometric tension studies. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation to bradykinin was significantly reduced in MetS. PVAT did not affect bradykinin-mediated dilation in arteries from lean swine but significantly exacerbated endothelial dysfunction in arteries from MetS swine. PVAT-induced impairment was reversed by inhibition of either PKC-beta with ruboxistaurin (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Ind) or leptin receptor signaling with a recombinant, pegylated leptin antagonist. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated increased PVAT-derived leptin and coronary leptin receptor density with MetS. Coronary PKC-beta activity was increased in both MetS arteries exposed to PVAT and lean arteries exposed to leptin. Finally, leptin-induced endothelial dysfunction was reversed by ruboxistaurin.CONCLUSIONS: Increases in epicardial PVAT leptin exacerbate coronary endothelial dysfunction in MetS via a PKC-beta-dependent pathway. These findings implicate PVAT-derived leptin as a potential contributor to coronary atherogenesis in MetS.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with increased production of adipokines, which are cytokine-like mediators that are produced mainly in adipose tissue but also in synovial cells. Since RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes are key players in the pathophysiology of RA, this study was undertaken to analyze the effects of the key adipokine adiponectin on proinflammatory and prodestructive synovial effector cells.METHODS: Lymphocytes were activated in part prior to stimulation. All cells were stimulated with adiponectin, and changes in gene and protein expression were determined by Affymetrix and protein arrays. Messenger RNA and protein levels were confirmed using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, and immunoassays. Intracellular signal transduction was evaluated using chemical signaling inhibitors.RESULTS: Adiponectin stimulation of human RASFs predominantly induced the secretion of chemokines, as well as proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandin synthases, growth factors, and factors of bone metabolism and matrix remodeling. Lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes responded to adiponectin stimulation with enhanced synthesis of cytokines and various chemokines. Additionally, chondrocytes released increased amounts of matrix metalloproteinases. In RASFs, adiponectin-mediated effects were p38 MAPK and protein kinase C dependent.CONCLUSION: Our previous findings indicated that adiponectin was present in inflamed synovium, at sites of cartilage invasion, in lymphocyte infiltrates, and in perivascular areas. The findings of the present study indicate that adiponectin induces gene expression and protein synthesis in human RASFs, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes, supporting the concept of adiponectin being involved in the pathophysiologic modulation of RA effector cells. Adiponectin promotes inflammation through cytokine synthesis, attraction of inflammatory cells to the synovium, and recruitment of prodestructive cells via chemokines, thus promoting matrix destruction at sites of cartilage invasion.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue releases an “adipocyte-derived relaxing factor” (ADRF) lowering tone of isolated arteries. The potential influence of hypoxia on the vasorelaxing properties of adipose tissue was investigated. Aortas from male Swiss mice with or without adherent adipose tissue were mounted in a wire myograph for isometric tension recording. Hypoxia (bubbling with 95% N(2), 5% CO(2)) relaxed precontracted (norephinephrine, 5 microM) aorta with adipose tissue while only a minimal vasorelaxing effect was observed in arteries without adipose tissue. This effect was also seen after precontraction with prostaglandin F(2alpha) (30 microM) or U-46619 (10 nM). Precontraction with 60 or 120 mM K(+), incubation with tetraethylammoniumchloride (3 mM) or glibenclamide (30 microM) significantly impaired the hypoxic response. Glibenclamide (30 microM) enhanced the vasorelaxing effect of NaHS (except at high concentrations of NaHS). Lactate (10 nM to 1 mM) had no effect on preparations with or without adipose tissue. 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (0.1 mM), zinc protoporphyrin IX (10 microM), 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4,3-A]quinoxalin-1-one (10 microM) and removal of the endothelium did not influence the hypoxic relaxation. Our findings indicate that hypoxia has a relaxing influence on mice aorta that is dependent on the presence of adherent adipose tissue. This relaxation is partly mediated by opening K(ATP) channels and independent of the endothelium and soluble guanylyl cyclase. Neither lactate, adenosine, CO nor H(2)S seems to be involved in this hypoxic response. However, the involvement of the as yet unidentified “adipocyte-derived relaxing factor” (ADRF) cannot be excluded.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Biological substances derived from perivascular fat modulate vascular tone, thus alterations in periadventitial adipose tissue (PVAT) may aggravate endothelial dysfunction in obesity.METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C57Bl/6 mice were fed either a high-fat diet or standard laboratory chow for 8 months. Vascular responses were studied in organ bath chambers from abdominal aortic ring preparations in the absence or presence of PVAT. The amount of PVAT as well as the cross-sectional area of adipocytes were increased in obese mice. In the presence of PVAT, obese aortas displayed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation whereas endothelium-independent vasodilatation was unaltered. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was restored after removal of PVAT and after reducing superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation in the vascular wall by Tiron or polyethylene-glycol-catalase, respectively. PVAT from obese mice showed increased formation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. The PVAT-derived oxidative stress was abolished by pretreatment with the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase inhibitor, apocynin. The anti-contractile function of PVAT found in lean mice was completely abolished in obese mice, but partially restored after pretreatment with Tiron. The mRNA expressions of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, leptin and NADPH oxidase were markedly higher in the PVAT of obese than lean mice.CONCLUSIONS: PVAT promotes endothelial dysfunction in diet-induced obese C57Bl/6 mice via mechanisms that are linked to increased NADPH oxidase-derived oxidative stress and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>

<p>In the context of obesity, perivascular fat produces various adipokines and releases free fatty acids, which may induce inflammation and proliferation in the vascular wall. In this study we investigated how adipokines, oleic acid (OA) and the combined treatment regulate human vascular smooth muscle cell (hVSMC) proliferation and migration and the underlying signalling pathways. Adipocyte-conditioned media (CM) generated from human adipocytes induces a prominent proliferation and migration of hVSMC. Autocrine action of adiponectin totally abolishes CM-induced proliferation. Furthermore, OA but not palmitic acid induces proliferation of hVSMC. CM itself does not contain fatty acids, but CM in combination with OA markedly enhances proliferation of hVSMC in a synergistic way. Both the nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were synergistically activated under these conditions and found to be essential for hVSMC proliferation. Expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide was only enhanced by combined treatment inducing a marked release of VEGF. Combination of OA and VEGF induces an additive increase of hVSMC proliferation. We could show that the combination of CM and OA led to a synergistic proliferation of hVSMC. Expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide were only enhanced under these conditions and were paralleled by a marked release of VEGF. These results suggest that the combined elevated release of fatty acids and adipokines by adipose tissue in obesity might be critically related to hVSMC dysfunction, vascular inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence suggests that adipose tissue not only stores energy but also secretes various bioactive substances called adipocytokines. Periadventitial fat is distributed ubiquitously around arteries throughout the body. It was reported that inflammatory changes in the periadventitial fat may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases accelerated by obesity. We investigated the effect of endovascular injury on the phenotype of perivascular fat.METHODS AND RESULTS: Endovascular injury significantly upregulated proinflammatory adipocytokines and downregulated adiponectin within periadventitial fat tissue in models of mouse femoral artery wire injury and rat iliac artery balloon injury. Genetic disruption of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha attenuated upregulation of proinflammatory adipocytokine expression, with reduced neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. Local delivery of TNF-alpha to the periadventitial area enhanced inflammatory adipocytokine expression, which was associated with augmented neointimal hyperplasia in TNF-alpha-deficient mice. Conditioned medium from a coculture of 3T3-L1 and RAW264 cells stimulated vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. An anti-TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody in the coculture abrogated the stimulating effect of the conditioned medium.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that endovascular injury induces rapid and marked changes in perivascular adipose tissue, mainly mediated by TNF-alpha. It is suggested that the phenotypic changes in perivascular adipose tissue may have a role in the pathogenesis of neointimal hyperplasia after angioplasty.</p>

<p>CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) lipoatrophy (LA) is a rare complication of insulin therapy. We aimed to analyze the ultrastructural and molecular aspects of LA lesions.SETTING AND PATIENTS: Macroscopic and microscopic morphology of SAT beneath the LA areas from patients with type 1 diabetes treated with Lispro insulin by continuous sc insulin infusion was studied using magnetic resonance imaging, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and quantitative PCR for adipose tissue-specific genes.RESULTS: SAT was present in LA lesions characterized by: 1) smaller, unilocular perilipin-positive adipocytes, with lipofuscin granules; 2) some “slimmed cells” losing lipid droplets as those we observed during starvation; and 3) numerous perivascular preadipocytes. We did not identify inflammatory cells. SAT in LA areas displayed a strong leptin down-regulation and an increase of AEBP1, a preadipocyte marker.CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly indicate that the remarkable reduction in fat cell lipid droplets and adipocyte size justifies the decrease of SAT without a reduction in adipocyte number because of necrosis or apoptosis. Thus, immune cells and any other toxic damaging fat cells were not involved in the generation of LA. We speculate that adipocytes chronically exposed to high local insulin concentrations could become severely insulin resistant, dramatically increasing lipolysis and giving rise to “slimmed cells.” Clinical LA regression could be explained by the active recruitment of preadipocytes, even if they were unable to differentiate and regenerate adipose tissue unless the insulin injection was removed.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is enzymatically generated in mammalian tissues from either L-cysteine or L-homocysteine. H(2)S possesses multiple biological activities, including regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. Hydrogen sulfide produced in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and perivascular adipose tissue dilates blood vessels by activating ATP-sensitive potassium channels. In addition, H(2)S produced locally within the kidney stimulates natriuresis and diuresis by increasing glomerular filtration and inhibiting tubular sodium reabsorption. Because H(2)S is oxidized in mitochondria in pO(2)-dependent manner and ambient pO(2) is physiologically low in the renal medulla, it is expected that the activity of H(2)S is higher in the medullary region than the cortical region. H(2)S, accumulating in increased amounts in the renal medulla under hypoxic conditions, may function as an oxygen sensor that restores O(2) balance by increasing medullary blood flow, reducing energy requirements for tubular transport, and directly inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Hypoxia is an important pathogenic factor in many renal diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion- or nephrotoxin-induced acute renal failure, progression of chronic nephropathies, diabetic nephropathy, and arterial hypertension. Deficiency of endogenous H(2)S may contribute to the pathogenesis of these pathologies by compromising medullary oxygenation, and administration of H(2)S donors may be of therapeutic value in these disorders.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a paracrine role in regulating vascular tone. We hypothesize that PVAT undergoes adaptative mechanisms during initial steps of diet-induced obesity (DIO) which contribute to preserve vascular function. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were assigned either to a control [low-fat (LF); 10% kcal from fat] or to a high-fat diet (HF; 45% kcal from fat). After 8 wk of dietary treatment vascular function was analyzed in the whole perfused mesenteric bed (MB) and in isolated mesenteric arteries cleaned of PVAT. Relaxant responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-4) m) and sodium nitroprusside (10(-12)-10(-5) m) were significantly ameliorated in the whole MB from HF animals. However, there was no difference between HF and LF groups in isolated mesenteric arteries devoid of PVAT. The enhancement of relaxant responses detected in HF mice was not attributable to an increased release of nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium nor to an increased sensitivity and/or activity of muscular guanilylcyclase. Mesenteric PVAT of HF animals showed an increased bioavailability of NO, detected by 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF2-DA) staining, which positively correlated with plasma leptin levels. DAF-2DA staining was absent in PVAT from ob/ob mice but was detected in these animals after 4-wk leptin replacement. The main finding in this study is that adaptative NO overproduction occurs in PVAT during early DIO which might be aimed at preserving vascular function.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSC) are routinely isolated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of homogenized adipose tissue. Similar to other types of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), ADSC remain difficult to define due to the lack of definitive cellular markers. Still, many types of MSC, including ADSC, have been shown to reside in a perivascular location, and increasing evidence shows that both MSC and ADSC may in fact be vascular stem cells (VSC). Locally, these cells differentiate into smooth muscle and endothelial cells that are assembled into newly formed blood vessels during angiogenesis and neovasculogenesis. Additionally, MSC or ADSC can also differentiate into tissue cells such as adipocytes in the adipose tissue. Systematically, MSC or ADSC are recruited to injury sites where they participate in the repair/regeneration of the injured tissue. Due to the vasculature’s dynamic capacity for growth and multipotential nature for diversification, VSC in tissue are individually at various stages and on different paths of differentiation. Therefore, when isolated and put in culture, these cells are expected to be heterogeneous in marker expression, renewal capacity, and differentiation potential. Although this heterogeneity of VSC does impose difficulties and cause confusions in basic science studies, its impact on the development of VSC as a therapeutic cell source has not been as apparent, as many preclinical and clinical trials have reported favorable outcomes. With this understanding, ADSC are generally defined as CD34+CD31- although loss of CD34 expression in culture is well documented. In adipose tissue, CD34 is localized to the intima and adventitia of blood vessels but not the media where cells expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) exist. By excluding the intima, which contains the CD34+CD31+ endothelial cells, and the media, which contains the CD34-CD31- smooth muscle cells, it leaves the adventitia as the only possible location for the CD34+ ADSC. In the capillary, CD34 and CD140b (a pericyte marker) are mutually exclusively expressed, thus suggesting that pericytes are not the CD34+ ADSC. Many other cellular markers for vascular cells, stem cells, and stem cell niche have also been investigated as possible ADSC markers. Particularly the best-known MSC marker STRO-1 has been found either expressed or not expressed in cultured ADSC. In the adipose tissue, STRO-1 appears to be expressed exclusively in the endothelium of certain but not all blood vessels, and thus not associated with the CD34+ ADSC. In conclusion, we believe that ADSC exist as CD34+CD31-CD104b-SMA- cells in the capillary and in the adventitia of larger vessels. In the capillary these cells coexist with pericytes and endothelial cells, both of which are possibly progenies of ADSC (or more precisely VSC). In the larger vessels, these ADSC or VSC exist as specialized fibroblasts (having stem cell properties) in the adventitia.</p>

<p>Recent studies have shown the effect of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on the regulation of vascular function; however, its role in the model of metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of losartan on PVAT-derived vascular dysfunction in fructose-induced hypertensive rats. Rats were fed with either water, 10% fructose, or 10% fructose with 10mg/kg losartan for 8 weeks. In the isolated aorta with PVAT and endothelium, contraction induced by norepinephrine (NE) was more potent in fructose-fed rats compared to control rats. Losartan normalized blood pressure, insulin resistance, and NE-induced vasoconstriction in fructose-fed rats. In the aortic rings with/without endothelium and with/without PVAT, losartan could not improve the acetylcholine-induced relaxation in fructose-fed rats. The observation suggested that losartan partly improved the PVAT-associated vascular regulation in fructose-induced hypertensive rats.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine, whether the amount of local pericoronary fat volume is associated with the presence of plaque burden in the underlying coronary artery segment.METHODS: We assessed 311 coronary segments from ECG-gated contrast-enhanced dual-source computed tomography for presence of plaque as well as segmental pericoronary fat volume. For pericoronary fat evaluation, regions of interest were manually traced containing any fat surrounding a coronary artery segment, with the myocardial wall, the pericardial sac and other coronary segments as outer border.RESULTS: Per each doubling of pericoronary fat volume, we observed an 2.5-fold increase in the presence of plaque in the underlying coronary segment in unadjusted models (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87-3.27, p&lt;0.001), which remained after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 3.07 [2.16-4.35], p&lt;0.001) and when additionally accounting for overall pericardial fat volume (OR 2.68 [1.90-3.79], p&lt;0.001). Associations were similar in all coronary artery segments and not related to the type of plaque (calcified or non-calcified, p&lt;0.01 for all).CONCLUSION: Pericoronary fat is associated with atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. Our results support the hypothesis that perivascular fat depots may function as a local endocrine risk factor in atherosclerosis development.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been derived from different cultured human tissues, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood. Only recently it was suggested that MSC descended from perivascular cells, the latter being defined as CD146<U+207A> neuro-glial proteoglycan (NG)2<U+207A> platelet-derived growth factor-Rß<U+207A> ALP<U+207A> CD34<U+207B> CD45<U+207B> von Willebrand factor (vWF)<U+207B> CD144<U+207B>. Herein we studied the properties of perivascular cells from a novel source, the foetal human umbilical cord (HUC) collected from pre-term newborns. By immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry we show that pre-term/foetal HUCs contain more perivascular cells than their full-term counterparts (2.5%versus 0.15%). Moreover, foetal HUC perivascular cells (HUCPC) express the embryonic cell markers specific embryonic antigen-4, Runx1 and Oct-4 and can be cultured over the long term. To further confirm the MSC identity of these cultured perivascular cells, we also showed their expression at different passages of antigens that typify MSC. The multilineage differentiative capacity of HUCPC into osteogenic, adipogenic and myogenic cell lineages was demonstrated in culture. In the perspective of a therapeutic application in chronic lung disease of pre-term newborns, we demonstrated the in vitro ability of HUCPC to migrate towards an alveolar type II cell line damaged with bleomycin, an anti-cancer agent with known pulmonary toxicity. The secretory profile exhibited by foetal HUCPC in the migration assay suggested a paracrine effect that could be exploited in various clinical conditions including lung disorders.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is implicated in the regulation of vascular function in the physiological state, but the modulatory effect of PVAT on vasculature during obesity is poorly understood. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) participate in the regulation of vascular function. We therefore investigated whether PVAT has a potential role through the AMPK/mTOR pathway in obesity-related vascular dysfunction. Wistar rats on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 months had higher periaortic fat mass compared with rats on a chow diet (3.31+/-0.56 vs. 2.34+/-0.28 g, P&lt;0.05). Obesity-related impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation of the aorta was markedly attenuated by temporary periaortic fat removal whereas obesity-related enhancement of contractile performance was unaffected. Rats on an HFD had thicker aortic tunica medias (180.06+/-7.56 vs. 128.14+/-13.21 microm for rats on a chow diet, P&lt;0.01) and larger periaortic adipocytes than rats on a chow diet (1209.00+/-62.65 vs. 447.20+/-21.31 microm(2), respectively, P&lt;0.01). Furthermore, mesenteric arterial rings incubated with periaortic fat from rats on an HFD demonstrated lower endothelium-dependent relaxation. This effect was absent in mesenteric arterial rings incubated with periaortic fat from rats on a chow diet. Moreover, an HFD led to a downregulation of AMPK and eNOS in the aorta with a concurrent upregulation of mTOR. In a parallel in vitro study, culturing vascular smooth muscle cells with periaortic adipocytes from rats on an HFD reduced the AMPK phosphorylation and increased mTOR phosphorylation, and the latter one was blocked by the incubation of compound C. We conclude that PVAT likely impacts obesity-related vascular dysfunction and remodeling through impairment of eNOS-mediated vasodilatation and the AMPK/mTOR pathway.</p>

<p>In rat mesenteric arteries we have recently found that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) promoted vasoconstriction to perivascular neuronal activation (by electrical field stimulation, EFS) through generation of superoxide. In this study, we examined the role of adipocyte-generated angiotensin II in PVAT-mediated potentiation of contraction to nerve stimulation. In rat mesenteric PVAT, the presence of angiotesinogen and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of angiotensin II in mesenteric PVAT. In rat mesenteric arteries, treatment of the vessels with an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (candesartan) reduced PVAT-mediated potentiation of EFS-induced contraction. Exogenously applied angiotensin II enhanced EFS-induced contraction in arteries without PVAT, but not in the arteries with intact PVAT. Chronic treatment with an ACE inhibitor quinapril (14 days) lowered blood pressure and alleviated the potentiation effects of PVAT in EFS-induced contraction. Mesenteric arteries from quinapril-treated group now exhibited the potentiation response to exogenously applied angiotensin II in arteries with intact PVAT to a comparable level as in arteries with PVAT removed. Treatment with hydralazine reduced blood pressure to the same level as quinapril treatment, but did not affect PVAT-associated potentiation of vasoconstriction to EFS and the response to exogenously applied angiotensin II in PVAT-intact arteries. These results showed that adipocyte-derived angiotensin II is critically involved in PVAT-mediated potentiation of EFS-evoked contraction in rat mesenteric arteries.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular fat through the secretion of paracrine and pro-inflammatory mediators may play a role in obesity-mediated vascular disease. We sought to examine associations between adipose tissue depots immediately surrounding the thoracic aorta, metabolic risk factors, and vascular calcification.METHODS: In participants free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort who underwent computed tomography (n=1067, mean age 59 years, 56.1% women), thoracic peri-aortic fat depots were quantified. Visceral abdominal tissue (VAT) and calcification of the thoracic and abdominal aorta were also measured.RESULTS: Peri-aortic fat depots were correlated with body mass index, waist circumference (WC), VAT (all p&lt;0.0001), hypertension (p=0.007), low HDL (p&lt;0.0001), serum triglycerides (p&lt;0.0001), impaired fasting glucose (p=0.005), and diabetes (p=0.02). These associations generally remained significant after adjustment for BMI and WC (all p-values&lt;0.05), but not after VAT adjustment. Thoracic aortic fat was associated with thoracic calcification in models containing VAT (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.71, p=0.04), but was not significant after adjustment for CVD risk factors (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.88-1.51, p=0.30). Thoracic aortic fat, however, was associated with abdominal aortic calcification (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98, p=0.008) and coronary artery calcification (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09-1.98, p=0.001) even in models including CVD risk factors and VAT.CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic peri-aortic fat is associated with measures of adiposity, metabolic risk factors, and coronary and abdominal aortic calcification.</p>

<p>In recent years, the general concept has emerged that chronic low-grade inflammation is the condition linking excessive development of adipose tissue and obesity-associated pathologies such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are characterized by a diminished production of protective factors such as adiponectin and increased detrimental adipocytokines such as leptin, resistin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by adipose tissue. Moreover, the evidence that the growth of the fat mass is associated with an accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages and T-lymphocytes has raised the hypothesis that the development of an inflammatory process within the growing fat mass is a primary event involved in the genesis of systemic metabolic and vascular alterations. This crosstalk of adipocyte, macrophage, lymphocyte, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells contribute to the production of various cytokines, chemokines, and hormone-like factors, which actively participate in the regulation of vascular function by an endocrine and/or paracrine pattern. Thus, the signaling from perivascular adipose to the blood vessels is emerging as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction.</p>

<p>Crosstalk between cells in the blood vessel wall is vital to normal vascular function and is perturbed in diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. Perivascular adipocytes reside at the adventitial border of blood vessels but until recently were virtually ignored in studies of vascular function. However, perivascular adipocytes have been demonstrated to be powerful endocrine cells capable of responding to metabolic cues and transducing signals to adjacent blood vessels. Accordingly, crosstalk between perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and blood vessels is now being intensely examined. Emerging evidence suggests that PVAT regulates vascular function through numerous mechanisms, but evidence to date suggests modulation of three key aspects that are the focus of this review: inflammation, vasoreactivity, and smooth muscle cell proliferation.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ secreting more than 30 various adipokines which regulate wide spectrum of metabolic and immune processes. Obesity is associated with development of adipose tissue inflammation. This inflammation is characterized by infiltration with macrophages, alterations of adipokine secretion, development of insulin resistance. All these factors promote atherosclerosis. Inflammation of perivascular adipose tissue is especially important. Adipokines damage vascular endothelium via paracrine pathway. Cytokines released by macrophages as well as changes of adipokine secretion lead to endothelial dysfunction - the first stage of atherogenesis. Besides specific action curative factors used in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus also produce anti-inflammatory effect and thus diminish risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, rate of their development, and alleviate manifestations of atherosclerosis. Inflammation of adipose tissue is a connecting link between obesity and atherosclerosis. This review contains an outline of roles of various major adipokines in development of atherosclerosis as well as synopsis of anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects of glytazones , metformin, rimonabant, statins, and of lowering of body weight.</p>

<p>Our lab has shown that left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) blunts endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced maximal contractions in normal pigs on low- and high-fat diets. Other studies report that PAT exerts anticontractile effects on agonist-induced arterial contraction via release of a relaxing factor that acts on the underlying vasculature. The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that PAT blunts LCX contraction in familial hypercholesterolemic pigs and that exercise training (Ex) augments this anticontractile effect. Male familial hypercholesterolemic pigs were divided into Ex (n = 13) and sedentary (Sed) (n = 15) groups. LCX reactivity to angiotensin II (ANG II), bradykinin (BK), ET-1, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was evaluated in vitro with intact or removed PAT in Sed and Ex familial hypercholesterolemic pigs. LCX relaxation induced by BK and SNP was not altered by Ex or PAT removal. LCX contractions stimulated by ANG II and ET-1 were not significantly altered by Ex or PAT removal across doses; however, Ex did act to significantly reduce ET-1 maximal contractions in familial hypercholesterolemic pig LCX compared with Sed familial hypercholesterolemic pig LCX, independent of PAT (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that LCX PAT in Sed and Ex familial hypercholesterolemic pigs exerts no substantial anticontractile influence over LCX vasomotor responses to endogenous constrictors such as ANG II and ET-1. Our results suggest that exercise training significantly reduces familial hypercholesterolemic pig LCX maximal contractile responses to the endogenous constrictor ET-1, independent of PAT.</p>

<p>A wealth of investigations, ranging from clinical and animal model studies to in vitro analyses, have generated great interest in the cardiovascular effects of leptin. Accordingly, many studies have examined the contribution of leptin to cardiac remodeling in heart failure and whether the effects of leptin on metabolism, apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and hypertrophy could explain the so-called obesity paradox. Furthermore, obesity and hyperleptinemia have often been associated with hypertension, and regulation of sympathetic tone or direct effects of leptin on contributors such as atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis have been documented. Unfortunately, translating basic research studies in vitro, or in animal models, to human physiology has proven difficult. The degree of leptin resistance in obesity is one intriguing issue that must be resolved. Furthermore, the importance of autocrine and paracrine effects of leptin derived from the heart and perivascular adipose tissue must be further studied. Carefully planned and executed research to conclusively establish distinct effects of leptin on the cardiovascular system in normal and diseased states will be essential to harness any therapeutic potential associated with leptin’s effects.</p>

<p>We studied the role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in the control of vascular function in an in vivo experimental model of hypertension produced by angiotensin II infusion by osmotic minipump in adult male Wistar rats. Two weeks after infusion with angiotensin II, blood pressure in treated rats was significantly elevated but heart rate was reduced compared with control rats infused with physiological saline. Contraction of aorta from the 2 groups of rats in response to phenylephrine or serotonin was significantly attenuated by the presence of PVAT in both the presence and absence of endothelium. This attenuation effect on contraction to phenylephrine was higher, however, in vessels from control rats than in vessels from hypertensive rats in the absence of endothelium. In the mesenteric resistance arteries, lumen diameter was larger in both hypertensive and control vessels with intact PVAT than in vessels with PVAT removed. The medial wall was thicker in arteries from hypertensive rats. The presence of PVAT potentiated the contraction induced by KCl in mesenteric arteries from control rats, but not in hypertensive rats. PVAT also attenuated the contraction of mesenteric arteries in response to phenylephrine or serotonin in both hypertensive and control groups. Mesenteric arteries from hypertensive rats were more responsive to stimulation by serotonin than those from control rats. We conclude that the increased blood pressure of Wistar rats that occurred after infusion with angiotensin II was associated with changes in the functions of PVAT in the aorta and mesenteric arteries and in the structure and function of resistance arteries.</p>

<p>The in vivo progenitor of culture-expanded mesenchymal-like adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) remains elusive, owing in part to the complex organization of stromal cells surrounding the small vessels, and the rapidity with which adipose stromal vascular cells adopt a mesenchymal phenotype in vitro. Immunohistostaining of intact adipose tissue was used to identify three markers (CD31, CD34, and CD146), which together unambiguously discriminate histologically distinct inner and outer rings of vessel-associated stromal cells, as well as capillary and small vessel endothelial cells. These markers were used in multiparameter flow cytometry in conjunction with stem/progenitor markers (CD90 and CD117) to further characterize stromal vascular fraction (SVF) subpopulations. Two mesenchymal and two endothelial populations were isolated by high speed flow cytometric sorting, expanded in short term culture, and tested for adipogenesis. The inner layer of stromal cells in contact with small vessel endothelium (pericytes) was CD146+/alpha-SMA+/CD90+/-/CD34-/CD31-; the outer adventitial stromal ring (designated supra adventitial-adipose stromal cells, SA-ASC) was CD146-/alpha-SMA-/CD90+/CD34+/CD31-. Capillary endothelial cells were CD31+/CD34+/CD90+ (endothelial progenitor), whereas small vessel endothelium was CD31+/CD34-/CD90- (endothelial mature). Flow cytometry confirmed these expression patterns and revealed a CD146+/CD90+/CD34+/CD31- pericyte subset that may be transitional between pericytes and SA-ASC. Pericytes had the most potent adipogenic potential, followed by the more numerous SA-ASC. Endothelial populations had significantly reduced adipogenic potential compared with unsorted expanded SVF cells. In adipose tissue, perivascular stromal cells are organized in two discrete layers, the innermost consisting of CD146+/CD34- pericytes, and the outermost of CD146-/CD34+ SA-ASC, both of which have adipogenic potential in culture. A CD146+/CD34+ subset detected by flow cytometry at low frequency suggests a population transitional between pericytes and SA-ASC.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as cells that undergo sustained in vitro growth and can give rise to multiple mesenchymal lineages. Because MSCs have only been isolated from tissue in culture, the equivalent cells have not been identified in vivo and little is known about their physiological roles or even their exact tissue location. In this study, we used phenotypic, morphological, and functional criteria to identify and prospectively isolate a subset of MSCs (PDGFRalpha+Sca-1+CD45-TER119-) from adult mouse bone marrow. Individual MSCs generated colonies at a high frequency and could differentiate into hematopoietic niche cells, osteoblasts, and adipocytes after in vivo transplantation. Naive MSCs resided in the perivascular region in a quiescent state. This study provides the useful method needed to identify MSCs as defined in vivo entities.</p>

<p>We have previously demonstrated that implanted microvessels form a new microcirculation with minimal host-derived vessel investment. Our objective was to define the vascular phenotypes present during neovascularization in these implants and identify post-angiogenesis events. Morphological, functional and transcriptional assessments identified three distinct vascular phenotypes in the implants: sprouting angiogenesis, neovascular remodeling, and network maturation. A sprouting angiogenic phenotype appeared first, characterized by high proliferation and low mural cell coverage. This was followed by a neovascular remodeling phenotype characterized by a perfused, poorly organized neovascular network, reduced proliferation, and re-associated mural cells. The last phenotype included a vascular network organized into a stereotypical tree structure containing vessels with normal perivascular cell associations. In addition, proliferation was low and was restricted to the walls of larger microvessels. The transition from angiogenesis to neovascular remodeling coincided with the appearance of blood flow in the implant neovasculature. Analysis of vascular-specific and global gene expression indicates that the intermediate, neovascular remodeling phenotype is transcriptionally distinct from the other two phenotypes. Therefore, this vascular phenotype likely is not simply a transitional phenotype but a distinct vascular phenotype involving unique cellular and vascular processes. Furthermore, this neovascular remodeling phase may be a normal aspect of the general neovascularization process. Given that this phenotype is arguably dysfunctional, many of the microvasculatures present within compromised or diseased tissues may not represent a failure to progress appropriately through a normally occurring neovascularization phenotype.</p>

<p>The metabolic syndrome represents a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors that promote the development of cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress is a mediator of endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling. We investigated vascular dysfunction in the metabolic syndrome and the oxidant mechanisms involved. New Zealand obese (NZO) mice with metabolic syndrome and New Zealand black control mice were studied. NZO mice showed insulin resistance and increased visceral fat and blood pressure compared with New Zealand black mice. Mesenteric resistance arteries from NZO mice exhibited increased media:lumen ratio and media cross-sectional area, demonstrating hypertrophic vascular remodeling. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, assessed by pressurized myography, was impaired in NZO mice, not affected by N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of endothelial NO synthase, and improved by the antioxidant Tempol, suggesting reduced NO bioavailability and increased oxidative stress. Dimer:monomer ratio of endothelial NO synthase was decreased in NZO mice compared with New Zealand black mice, suggesting endothelial NO synthase uncoupling. Furthermore, vascular superoxide and peroxynitrite production was increased, as well as adhesion molecule expression. Perivascular adipose tissue of NZO mice showed increased superoxide production and NADPH oxidase activity, as well as adipocyte hypertrophy, associated with inflammatory Mac-3-positive cell infiltration. Vasoconstriction to norepinephrine decreased in the presence of perivascular adipose tissue in New Zealand black mice but was unaffected by perivascular adipose tissue in NZO mice, suggesting loss of perivascular adipose tissue anticontractile properties. Our data suggest that this rodent model of metabolic syndrome is associated with perivascular adipose inflammation and oxidative stress, hypertrophic resistance artery remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction, the latter a result of decreased NO and enhanced superoxide generated by uncoupled endothelial NO synthase.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to examine the function of perivascular adiposa tissue (PVAT) on vascular relaxation response in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the modulatory effects of the atorvastatin therapy on the PVAT functions. We investigated the mechanisms of the perivascular adipocyte-derived relaxation factor (PVRF) by using isolated rat’s aortic rings and isometric contraction measurements. We found that contraction of the thoracic aorta induced by phenylephrine was significantly attenuated in the presence of PVAT from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY group) or the spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with atorvastatin (SHR-A group, atorvastatin 50mg/kg/day), whereas this effect was not observed in the thoracic aortic rings from the control SHR (SHR group). Transferring the solution incubated with PVAT-intact thoracic aorta to PVAT-free thoracic aorta, it induced a remarkable relaxation response in the WKY but not in the control SHR. Tetraethylammoniumchloride (TEA) could block the above relaxation. It was also shown that the PVRF function was likely, depending on the extracellular [Ca(2+)]; the anti-contractile effect of PVAT could be reduced by the inhibitor of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent potassium channels, glibenclamide, and could be reduced by the inhibitor of cyclooxygenase by indomethacin. We thus infer that the PVAT function was distorted in hypertension rats, and the lipid-lowering treatment with atorvastatin could restore the PVAT function. The function of the PVRF may involve the Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels, the ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC), and the release of PVRF from PVAT may involve prostaglandins (PGs) and the calcium metabolism. These results provide an insight into the pathological mechanisms of hypertension development, and indicate that the PVAT may be a potential new target for the hypertensive therapy.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: A major site of action for the atheroprotective drug nicotinic acid (NA) is adipose tissue, via the G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR109A. Since, adipose tissue is an active secretory organ that contributes both positively and negatively to systemic inflammatory processes associated with cardiovascular disease, we hypothesized that NA would act directly upon adipocytes to alter the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines, and the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin.METHODS AND RESULTS: TNF-alpha treatment (1.0ng/mL) of 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in an increase in gene expression of fractalkine (9+/-3.3-fold, P&lt;0.01); monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (24+/-1.2-fold, P&lt;0.001), ‘regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted’ (RANTES) (500+/-55-fold, P&lt;0.001) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (200+/-70-fold, P&lt;0.05). The addition of NA (10(-4)M) to TNF-alpha-treated adipocytes attenuated expression of fractalkine (50+/-12%, P&lt;0.01); MCP-1 (50+/-6%, P&lt;0.01), RANTES (70+/-3%, P&lt;0.01) and iNOS (60+/-16%). This pattern was mirrored in protein released from the adipocytes into the surrounding media. The effect on gene expression was neutralised by pre-treatment with pertussis toxin. NA attenuated macrophage chemotaxis (by 27+/-3.5%, P&lt;0.001) towards adipocyte conditioned media. By contrast, NA, (10(-6)-10(-3)M) increased, in a dose-dependent manner, mRNA of the atheroprotective hormone adiponectin (3-5-fold n=6, P&lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: NA suppresses pro-atherogenic chemokines and upregulates the atheroprotective adiponectin through a G-protein-coupled pathway. Since adipose tissue has the potential to contribute to both systemic and local (perivascular) inflammation associated with atherosclerosis our results suggest a new “pleiotropic” role for NA.</p>

<p>A perivascular epithelioid tumor (PEComa) is a rare tumor probably arising from the perivascular epithelioid cells. Only three cases of pancreatic PEComa have been reported in the English-language literature. The present report describes an extremely rare case of pancreatic PEComa. A 47-year-old Japanese woman complained of lower abdominal pain and a well-demarcated solid tumor was found in the pancreatic head. There was no history of tuberous sclerosis complexes. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was thus performed. There was a well-demarcated, solid tumor measuring 17 mm in the pancreatic head. The tumor was composed of a diffuse proliferation of epithelioid tumor cells with many blood vessels but no adipose tissue. The tumor cells expressed HMB45 and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells possessed many membrane-bound granules that were positive for HMB45 on immunoelectron microscopy. The results of immunoelectron microscopy show that some PEComas possess not only typical melanosomes or premelanosomes but also aberrant melanosomes.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases vascular relaxation factor(s), but the identity of this relaxation factor remains unknown. Here, we examined if angiotensin 1-7 [Ang-(1-7)] is one of the relaxation factors released by PVAT.METHOD: Morphological and functional methods were used to study aorta from adult Wistar rats.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining showed abundant presence of Ang-(1-7) in aortic PVAT. In vessels with PVAT removed but intact endothelium (PVAT - E+), contraction induced by phenylephrine was attenuated by preincubation with Ang-(1-7). PVAT - E+ vessels precontracted with phenylephrine showed a concentration-dependent relaxation response to Ang-(1-7), and this response was abolished by the removal of endothelium. Relaxation response induced by Ang-(1-7) was also prevented by Ang-(1-7) receptor (Mas) antagonist (A779), nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and nitric oxide scavenger. Ang-(1-7) did not cause a relaxation response in aorta precontracted with KCl, and the relaxation response to Ang-(1-7) was also blocked by calcium-dependent potassium (K(Ca)) channel blockers. Incubation of PVAT + E+ vessels with A779 or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitor DX600 or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat increased the contraction induced by phenylephrine. Transfer of donor solution incubated with PVAT + E+ vessel to recipient PVAT - E+ vessel caused a relaxation response. This relaxation response was abolished when donor vessels were incubated with DX600 or enalaprilat or when recipient vessels were incubated with A779.CONCLUSION: Ang-(1-7) released by PVAT acts on the endothelium to cause the release of nitric oxide, and nitric oxide acts as a hyperpolarizing factor through K(Ca) channels to cause relaxation of the blood vessel.</p>

<p>Hypertension and dyslipidemia frequently coexist in patients with progressive insulin resistance and thus constitute metabolic syndrome. We sought to determine the merits of combining an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor in treating this pathological condition. Five-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, a model of metabolic syndrome, were untreated or treated with olmesartan 3 mg kg(-1) per day, pravastatin 30 mg kg(-1) per day or their combination for 25 weeks. Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats served as normal controls. The antihypertensive effect of olmesartan and the lipid-lowering properties of pravastatin were both augmented by the combination. The oral glucose tolerance test revealed that only the combined treatment significantly reduced the area under the time-glucose curve, which was accompanied by augmented adiponectin messenger RNA expression in epididymal adipose tissue. Although the total cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) content did not significantly differ among the groups, the combined treatment significantly increased the content of dihydrofolate reductase, a key eNOS coupler. Dihydroethidium staining of the aorta showed that the combination most significantly attenuated superoxide production. Moreover, Azan-Mallory staining revealed that the combination most significantly limited the perivascular fibrosis and wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries. In conclusion, the combination of olmesartan and pravastatin augmented adiponectin expression in white adipose tissue and improved glucose tolerance in a rat model of metabolic syndrome, which was associated with more significant ameliorations of cardiovascular redox state and remodeling than those by treatments with either agent alone.</p>

<p>Muscle regeneration involves the coordination of myogenesis and revascularization to restore proper muscle function. Myogenesis is driven by resident stem cells termed satellite cells (SC), whereas angiogenesis arises from endothelial cells and perivascular cells of preexisting vascular segments and the collateral vasculature. Communication between myogenic and angiogenic cells seems plausible, especially given the number of growth factors produced by SC. To characterize these interactions, we developed an in vitro coculture model composed of rat skeletal muscle SC and microvascular fragments (MVF). In this system, isolated epididymal MVF suspended in collagen gel are cultured over a rat SC monolayer culture. In the presence of SC, MVF exhibit greater indices of angiogenesis than MVF cultured alone. A positive dose-dependent effect of SC conditioned medium (CM) on MVF growth was observed, suggesting that SC secrete soluble-acting growth factor(s). Next, we specifically blocked VEGF action in SC CM, and this was sufficient to abolish satellite cell-induced angiogenesis. Finally, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcriptional regulator of VEGF gene expression, was found to be expressed in cultured SC and in putative SC in sections of in vivo stretch-injured rat muscle. Hypoxic culture conditions increased SC HIF-1alpha activity, which was positively associated with SC VEGF gene expression and protein levels. Collectively, these initial observations suggest that a heretofore unexplored aspect of satellite cell physiology is the initiation of a proangiogenic program.</p>

<p>Many features of adipose tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells, such as physiological function and localization, have recently been examined. Adipose-tissue turnover is very slow and its perivascular progenitor cells differentiate into adipocytes in the next generation. The progenitor cells play important roles in physiological turnover, hyperplasia and atrophy of adipose tissue, as well as in incidental remodeling, such as postinjury repair. Adipose tissue has been used as an autologous filler for soft tissue defects, despite unpredictable clinical results and a low rate of graft survival, which may be due to the relative deficiency of progenitor cells in graft materials. A novel transplantation strategy, termed cell-assisted lipotransfer, involves the enrichment of adipose progenitor cells in grafts; preliminary results suggest this approach to be safe and effective.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Inflammation in adipose tissue has been implicated in vascular dysfunction, but the local mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: Small arteries with and without perivascular adipose tissue were taken from subcutaneous gluteal fat biopsy samples and studied with wire myography and immunohistochemistry. We established that healthy adipose tissue around human small arteries secretes factors that influence vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability. However, in perivascular fat from obese subjects with metabolic syndrome (waist circumference 111+/-2.8 versus 91.1+/-3.5 cm in control subjects, P&lt;0.001; insulin sensitivity 41+/-5.9% versus 121+/-18.6% in control subjects, P&lt;0.001), the loss of this dilator effect was accompanied by an increase in adipocyte area (1786+/-346 versus 673+/-60 mum(2), P&lt;0.01) and immunohistochemical evidence of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 12.4+/-1.1% versus 6.7+/-1%, P&lt;0.001). Application of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor receptor-alpha and interleukin-6 to perivascular fat around healthy blood vessels reduced dilator activity, resulting in the obese phenotype. These effects could be reversed with free radical scavengers or cytokine antagonists. Similarly, induction of hypoxia stimulated inflammation and resulted in loss of anticontractile capacity, which could be rescued by catalase and superoxide dismutase or cytokine antagonists. Incubation with a soluble fragment of adiponectin type 1 receptor or inhibition of nitric oxide synthase blocked the vasodilator effect of healthy perivascular adipose tissue.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that adipocytes secrete adiponectin and provide the first functional evidence that it is a physiological modulator of local vascular tone by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability. This capacity is lost in obesity by the development of adipocyte hypertrophy, leading to hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) can be useful in the evaluation of right ventricular (RV) regional dysfunction due to pulmonary diseases. The aim of the study was to assess RV dysfunction in patients with severe interstitial lung diseases (ILD), using both TDI and conventional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The study group consisted of 40 consecutive patients with end-stage ILD referred for lung transplantation (LT). Eighteen of them, mean age 47 +/-12 yr, who fulfilled the ATS/ERS criteria for LT (mean forced vital capacity (FVC) 1.4 +/-0.8 l, mean diffusing capacity for carbon dioxide (DLCO) &lt;50% of predicted) constituted the active group, and 22 age-matched patients (mean age 49 +/-12 yr), who did not fulfill these criteria, were placed in the waiting group for LT. We found that among the TDI parameters, the longitudinal peak systolic strain rate (SR) measured at the RV outflow tract, was significantly more negative (-1.1 +/-0.3 vs. -3.2 +/-1.2 s(-1), P=0.03) and the time to peak velocity (TpVEL) in the medial and apical septal segments were shorter (129.9 +/-47.9 vs. 159.2 +/-38.1 ms, P=0.018 and 126.8 +/-44.3 vs. 154.6 +/-40.9 ms, P=0.019) in the patients from the active than those from the waiting group. TTE showed that patients from the active group had significantly lower values of tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (14.3 +/-3.3 vs. 20.6 +/-6.2 mm, P=0.0003) and pulmonary artery acceleration time (PVAT) (70.3 +/-23.3 vs. 96.9 +/-12.4 ms, P=0.0001)compared with those from the waiting group. No other differences were found for other parameters of RV function between the examined groups. In conclusion, severity of lung disease in patients with ILD influences RV systolic dysfunction, which is reflected in both TDI and conventional echocardiographic parameters.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Perivascular adipose tissue may be associated with the amount of local atherosclerosis. We developed a novel and reproducible method to standardize volumetric quantification of periaortic adipose tissue by computed tomography (CT) and determined the association with anthropometric measures of obesity, and abdominal adipose tissue.METHODS: Measurements of adipose tissue were performed in a random subset of participants from the Framingham Heart Study (n=100) who underwent multidetector CT of the thorax (ECG triggering, 2.5 mm slice thickness) and the abdomen (helical CT acquisition, 2.5 mm slice thickness). Abdominal periaortic adipose tissue (AAT) was defined by a 5 mm cylindrical region of interest around the aortic wall; thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (TAT) was defined by anatomic landmarks. TAT and AAT were defined as any voxel between -195 and -45 HU and volumes were measured using dedicated semiautomatic software. Measurement reproducibility and association with anthropometric measures of obesity, and abdominal adipose tissue were determined.RESULTS: The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility for both AAT and TAT was excellent (ICC: 0.97 and 0.97; 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Similarly, the relative intra- and inter-observer difference was small for both AAT (-1.85+/-1.28% and 7.85+/-6.08%; respectively) and TAT (3.56+/-0.83% and -4.56+/-0.85%, respectively). Both AAT and TAT were highly correlated with visceral abdominal fat (r=0.65 and 0.77, P&lt;0.0001 for both) and moderately correlated with subcutaneous abdominal fat (r=0.39 and 0.42, P&lt;0.0001 and P=0.009), waist circumference (r=0.49 and 0.57, P&lt;0.0001 for both) and body mass index (r=0.47 and 0.58, P&lt;0.0001 for both).CONCLUSION: Standardized semiautomatic CT-based volumetric quantification of periaortic adipose tissue is feasible and highly reproducible. Further investigation is warranted regarding associations of periaortic adipose tissue with other body fat deposits, cardiovascular risk factors and clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue depots originate from distinct precursor cells, are functionally diverse, and modulate disease processes in a depot-specific manner. However, the functional properties of perivascular adipocytes, and their influence on disease of the blood vessel wall, remain to be determined. We show that human coronary perivascular adipocytes exhibit a reduced state of adipocytic differentiation as compared with adipocytes derived from subcutaneous and visceral (perirenal) adipose depots. Secretion of antiinflammatory adiponectin is markedly reduced, whereas that of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, is markedly increased in perivascular adipocytes. These depot-specific differences in adipocyte function are demonstrable in both freshly isolated adipose tissues and in vitro-differentiated adipocytes. Murine aortic arch perivascular adipose tissues likewise express lower levels of adipocyte-associated genes as compared with subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. Moreover, 2 weeks of high-fat feeding caused further reductions in adipocyte-associated gene expression, while upregulating proinflammatory gene expression, in perivascular adipose tissues. These changes were observed in the absence of macrophage recruitment to the perivascular adipose depot. We conclude that perivascular adipocytes exhibit reduced differentiation and a heightened proinflammatory state, properties that are intrinsic to the adipocytes residing in this depot. Dysfunction of perivascular adipose tissue induced by fat feeding suggests that this unique adipose depot is capable of linking metabolic signals to inflammation in the blood vessel wall.</p>

<p>The obesity epidemic is a global public health concern that increases the likelihood of morbidity and mortality of metabolic and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and threatens to reduce life expectancy around the world. The concept of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) takes into account the essential role that visceral fat plays in the development of metabolic and CVDs, and indicates how waist circumference measurement aids patient identification in the clinical setting. However, MetS cannot be used to assess global CVD risk and is, at best, another modifiable risk factor. Thus, the global cardiometabolic risk (ie, global risk of CVD resulting from traditional risk factors combined with the additional contribution of MetS) should be considered individually. The contribution of abdominal obesity to global cardiometabolic risk is reviewed and also discussed are potential underlying mechanisms including adipocytokine, insulin resistance, lipotoxicity and ectopic fat deposition in the heart components: (1) circulatory and locally recruited fat, (2) intra-and extra-myocellular fat, (3) perivascular fat, and (4) pericardial fat.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: To study the acute and chronic effect of hyperglycemia on perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) function in rat aorta.METHOD: Alterations in PVAT function in rat aorta incubated with 22 mmol/l D-glucose for 30 min and in aorta from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were studied.RESULTS: Incubation with D-glucose caused an attenuation of contraction in response to phenylephrine, both in the presence and absence of endothelium, whereas removal of PVAT eliminated this attenuation effect. The presence of PVAT did not affect concentration-related relaxation response of the aorta to carbamylcholine in STZ rats. There was also no difference in the relaxation response of the aorta to carbamylcholine between STZ and control rats. The presence of PVAT, however, caused a higher attenuation of the concentration-dependent contraction to phenylephrine in aorta from STZ rats with intact endothelium as compared with that from control rats. Incubation of the aorta from control rats with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine or carboxy-2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetra-methyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potentiated the contraction of the vessels to phenylephrine, and this potentiation effect was higher in the vessels from STZ rats than control rats when N-nitro-L-arginine was used. Removal of PVAT reduced this potentiation effect and eliminated the difference between the vessels from control and STZ rats.CONCLUSION: Under both acute and chronic conditions, hyperglycemia enhanced the relaxation response of the vessels mediated by PVAT. These new findings provide important information on the mechanism underlying the postprandial effect of hyperglycemia on blood pressure control and the presence of hypotension under chronic hyperglycemia in a type-1 model of diabetes.</p>

<p>Leptin, a product of the obesity gene, is a molecule that has received much attention since its cloning in 1994. Initially, most work centered around the effects of leptin on satiety and energy balance. However, in recent years there has been an intense focus on leptin as it relates to the cardiovascular system. Plasma leptin concentration is markedly elevated in obesity and the metabolic syndrome, both of which are associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular pathologies. In many studies, hyperleptinemia has been linked to endothelial dysfunction (a known precursor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that leptin released from perivascular adipose tissue may also have deleterious effects on the underlying vasculature, including the coronary circulation. This report reviews pertinent literature on leptin-mediated endothelial dysfunction, leptin-mediated sympathetic activation, and leptin as a significant perivascular adipose-derived factor.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the impact and safety of fibrinolytic therapy (FT) in left - side prosthetic valve acute thrombosis (PVAT).STUDY OBJECTIVE: To improve our knowledge about the FT role in left -side PVAT.DESIGN: Bibliographic search and analysis.METHODS: MEDLINE search from January 1970 to January 2007. Studies were classified according to the evidence level recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians and included if they had objective diagnosis of left-side PAVT and FT efficacy assessment (hemodynamic, echocardiographic or fluoroscopic improvement). New York Heart Association class was used to establish functional state. Data on clinical characteristics, diagnosis strategy, anticoagulation status, fibrinolytic and heparin regimens, cardiovascular adverse events, outcome, and follow-up were also required.RESULTS: A systematic search produced a total of 900 references. Each abstract was analyzed according to the predetermined criteria. Thirty-two references with 904 patients constitute the subject of this analysis. Only one trial had evidence III and thirty-one evidence V. FT was more used in young female patients (64%) with prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis (77%), and clinical instability (82%). Transesophageal echocardiogram had a higher thrombus detection rate (100%). Although several fibrinolytic regimens were used in a first or second course, streptokinase was the most frequent agent (61%). Clinical improvement was observed in 86% of the patients, objective success in 78%, and failure in 14%. Rescue fibrinolysis was done in 17%.COMPLICATIONS: peripheral and cerebral embolism rate was 5% and 4%, respectively. Major bleeding 4% and intracranial hemorrhage 1%.CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence demonstrates that in PVAT fibrinolytic therapy improves the outcome in younger, more ill patients, especially females, independently of the fibrinolytic regimen used with a low complications rate.</p>

<p>AIMS: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contraction and stimulates VSMC proliferation by releasing protein factors. The present study was to determine whether visfatin is involved in these paracrine actions of PVAT, and if so, to explore the underlying mechanisms.METHODS AND RESULTS: Visfatin was preferentially expressed in Sprague-Dawley rat and monkey aortic PVAT, compared with subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. The PVAT-derived visfatin was found to be a VSMC growth factor rather than a VSMC relaxing factor, which was proved by visfatin-specific antibody/inhibitor and direct observation of recombinant visfatin. Exogenous visfatin stimulated VSMC proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) and p38 signalling pathways. This proliferative effect was further confirmed by enhancement of DNA synthesis and upregulation of proliferative marker Ki-67. Visfatin had no anti-apoptotic effect on normal cultured VSMCs, and it exerted an anti-apoptotic effect only during cell apoptosis induced by H2O2, excluding a role of anti-apoptosis in the visfatin-induced VSMC proliferation. Insulin receptor knockdown did not show any action on the visfatin effect. However, visfatin acted as a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase to biosynthesize nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which mediated proliferative signalling pathways and cell proliferation similar to the visfatin effect.CONCLUSION: Visfatin stimulates VSMC proliferation via NMN-mediated ERK1/2 and p38 signalling. The present study provides a molecular link of visfatin to the paracrine action of PVAT, demonstrates a novel function of visfatin in promoting VSMC proliferation, and reveals NMN as a novel signalling molecule that triggers the proliferative process.</p>

<p>Several studies published in the past three decades have suggested that the adaptive immune system contributes to hypertension. Recent studies have shown that T cells play a crucial role in the blood pressure elevation caused by angiotensin II and in response to sodium and volume challenge. Hypertensive stimuli cause effector T cells to enter visceral fat, in particular perivascular fat, where they release cytokines that promote vasoconstriction. Similarly, effector T cells accumulate in the kidney in hypertension and contribute to renal dysfunction, promoting sodium and volume retention. These findings provide some insight into the relationship between inflammation and hypertension and suggest that efforts to reduce T-cell activation may be useful in preventing or treating this disease.</p>

<p>Endothelial dysfunction comprises a number of functional alterations in the vascular endothelium that are associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including changes in vasoregulation, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, inflammatory activation, and altered barrier function. Hyperglycemia is a characteristic feature of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and plays a pivotal role in diabetes-associated microvascular complications. Although hyperglycemia also contributes to the occurrence and progression of macrovascular disease (the major cause of death in type 2 diabetes), other factors such as dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and adipose-tissue-derived factors play a more dominant role. A mutual interaction between these factors and endothelial dysfunction occurs during the progression of the disease. We pay special attention to the possible involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the role of obesity and adipose-derived adipokines as contributors to endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. The close interaction of adipocytes of perivascular adipose tissue with arteries and arterioles facilitates the exposure of their endothelial cells to adipokines, particularly if inflammation activates the adipose tissue and thus affects vasoregulation and capillary recruitment in skeletal muscle. Hence, an initial dysfunction of endothelial cells underlies metabolic and vascular alterations that contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that have the capacity to develop into different mature mesenchymal cell types. They were originally isolated from bone marrow, but MSC-like cells have also been isolated from other tissues. The common feature of all of these tissues is that they all house blood vessels. It is, thus, possible that MSCs are associated with perivascular locations. The objective of this work was to test the hypothesis that MSCs are associated with blood vessels by verifying if MSC frequency positively correlates with blood vessel density. To this end, samples from highly and poorly vascularized adipose tissue sites of two equine donors were collected and processed for histology and cell isolation. MSC frequency in these samples was estimated by means of CFU-F assays, which were performed under MSC conditions. Culture-adherent cells from equine adipose tissue and bone marrow were culture expanded, tested for differentiation into mesenchymal cell types in vitro, and implanted in vivo in porous ceramic vehicles to assess their osteogenic capacity, using human MSCs and brain pericytes as controls. The differentiation assays showed a difference between adipose tissue-derived cells as compared to equine bone marrow MSCs. While differences in CFU-F frequencies between both donors were evident, the CFU-F numbers correlated directly with blood vessel densities (r(2) = 0.86). We consider these preliminary data as further evidence linking MSCs to blood vessels.</p>

<p>Renal angiomyolipoma is a benign tumour histologically characterized by a mixture of adipose tissue, smooth muscle cells and thick walled blood vessels. Long-believed to be a benign hamartoma, angiomyolipoma is now considered to arise from perivascular epithelioid cells. Epithelioid angiomyolipoma is a rare type of angiomyolipoma, composed partially or completely of epithelioid cells, with a potentially aggressive behaviour. Histologically it can mimic renal cell carcinoma. Positivity for HMB45, Melan A, CD68 and CD117 are useful for diagnosis. Herein, we report the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of a renal tumour composed of large epithelioid mononucleated or multinucleated cells with abundant acidophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Despite the morphologic resemblance of this tumour to renal cell carcinoma, its phenotype (HMB45, Melan A and CD68 positivity and keratin negativity) parallels the phenotypic profile of angiomyolipoma. Therefore, immunohistochemistry should be considered when diagnosing this variant of angiomyolipoma.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the archetypal multipotent progenitor cells derived in cultures of developed organs, are of unknown identity and native distribution. We have prospectively identified perivascular cells, principally pericytes, in multiple human organs including skeletal muscle, pancreas, adipose tissue, and placenta, on CD146, NG2, and PDGF-Rbeta expression and absence of hematopoietic, endothelial, and myogenic cell markers. Perivascular cells purified from skeletal muscle or nonmuscle tissues were myogenic in culture and in vivo. Irrespective of their tissue origin, long-term cultured perivascular cells retained myogenicity; exhibited at the clonal level osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic potentials; expressed MSC markers; and migrated in a culture model of chemotaxis. Expression of MSC markers was also detected at the surface of native, noncultured perivascular cells. Thus, blood vessel walls harbor a reserve of progenitor cells that may be integral to the origin of the elusive MSCs and other related adult stem cells.</p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS: Different ectopic fat depots, such as visceral or hepatic fat, are known to affect whole body insulin sensitivity. It has recently been hypothesised that differences in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) mass around resistance vessels may also contribute to insulin resistance, possibly via direct vascular effects leading to reduced capillary cross-sectional area in the muscle, which in turn affects muscular blood flow and glucose uptake. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to test whether PVAT around conduit arteries (i.e. the brachial artery) influences NO bioavailability, expressed as flow-mediated dilation (FMD), or insulin sensitivity in humans in vivo.METHODS: Insulin sensitivity was measured by OGTT in all 95 participants (59 women, 36 men; median age 47 years, range 19-66 years) and by the gold standard, a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, in a randomly selected subgroup of 33 participants. Quantification of the different fat compartments, including PVAT around the brachial artery, was achieved by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T). Blood flow and FMD were measured at the brachial artery using high-resolution (13 MHz) ultrasound, after 5 min of forearm occlusion.RESULTS: PVAT was negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity and the post-ischaemic increase in blood flow. The association between PVAT and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.54, beta = -0.37, p = 0.009) was independent of age, sex, visceral adipose tissue, liver fat, BMI and further cardiovascular risk factors. No correlation could be detected between PVAT and local endothelial function. However, we observed an independent association between PVAT and post-ischaemic increase in blood flow (r = -0.241; beta = -1.69; p = 0.02).INTERPRETATION: PVAT seems to play an independent role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. This may be due to direct vascular effects influencing muscular blood flow.</p>

<p>Adipose stromal cells (ASC) are multipotential mesenchymal progenitor cells that are readily induced to undergo adipogenic differentiation, and we have recently demonstrated them to have functional and phenotypic overlap with pericytes lining microvessels in adipose tissues. In this study we addressed the hypothesis that modulation of ASC fate within this perivascular niche can occur via interaction with endothelial cells (EC), which serve to modulate the adipogenic potential of ASC. To this end, we investigated contact as well as paracrine effects of EC on ASC adipogenesis, in two-dimensional coculture and via conditioned medium and analyzed mutual gene expression changes by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A significant decrease in adipogenic differentiation was observed in ASC when they were cocultured with EC but not control fibroblasts. This endothelial cell-specific effect was accompanied by increased expression of factors involved in Wnt signaling, most prominently Wnt1, Wnt4, and Wnt10a, which are well-known inhibitors of adipogenesis. Suppression of Wnt1 but not Wnt 10a or scrambled control short interfering RNA in cocultures partially reversed the endothelial cell effect, thus increasing adipogenic differentiation, suggesting a plausible role of Wnt1 ligand in modulation of adipogenesis by the vasculature. Furthermore, addition of recombinant Wnt ligand or the Wnt signaling agonist inhibited adipogenic differentiation of ASC in the absence of EC. In conclusion, these data define the relationship in adipose tissue between ASC and EC in the perivascular niche, in which the latter act to repress adipogenesis, thereby stabilizing vasculature. It is tempting to speculate that abnormal endothelial function may be associated with pathologic derepression of adipogenesis.

<p>In Wistar rats, maternal exposure to nicotine was shown to impair the inhibitory function of perivascular adipose tissue on vascular contractility in the aorta of the offspring. It is not known whether an impairment of perivascular adipose tissue function occurs in smaller arteries, and whether the control of blood pressure is affected. Here we studied the blood pressure effects and the alteration of perivascular adipose tissue function in mesenteric arteries of the offspring born to Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) dams exposed to nicotine. Nulliparous female WKY rats were given either nicotine bitartrate (1 mg/kg/day) or saline (vehicle) by subcutaneous injection 2 weeks prior to mating, during pregnancy and until weaning. Blood pressure of the offspring and functional studies with mesenteric arteries were conducted. Tissue samples (thoracic aorta, mesenteric arteries, and kidneys) were collected for morphological and immunohistochemical examinations. Blood pressure increased from 14 weeks of age onwards in the offspring born to nicotine-exposed dams. Nicotine-exposed offspring showed a significant increase in the number of brown adipocytes in aortic perivascular adipose tissue relative to control offspring. In mesenteric arteries from control offspring, contractile responses induced by phenylephrine, serotonin, and 9,11-dideoxy-11alpha, 9alpha-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F(2)alpha (U44619) were significantly attenuated in the presence of perivascular adipose tissue, an effect not observed in the nicotine-exposed tissues. Endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to carbachol, kidney weight, the total number of nephrons and glomerulus’ size were comparable in nicotine and saline groups. We conclude that fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine caused blood pressure elevation. Alterations in perivascular adipose tissue composition and modulatory function are some of the mechanisms associated with this blood pressure increase.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) is a possible source of stem cells for the repair of articular cartilage defects. In this study, adherent proliferative cells were isolated from digests of IPFP tissue. The effects of the expansion of these cells in fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) were tested on their proliferation, characterisation, and chondrogenic potential.METHODS: IPFP tissue was obtained from six patients undergoing total knee replacement, and sections were stained with 3G5, alpha smooth muscle actin, and von Willebrand factor to identify different cell types in the vasculature. Cells were isolated from IPFP, and both mixed populations and clonal lines derived from them were characterised for cell surface epitopes, including 3G5. Cells were expanded with and without FGF-2 and were tested for chondrogenic differentiation in cell aggregate cultures.RESULTS: 3G5-positive cells were present in perivascular regions in tissue sections of the IPFP, and proliferative adherent cells isolated from the IPFP were also 3G5-positive. However, 3G5 expression was on only a small proportion of cells in all populations and at all passages, including the clonally expanded cells. The cells showed cell surface epitope expression similar to adult stem cells. They stained strongly for CD13, CD29, CD44, CD90, and CD105 and were negative for CD34 and CD56 but were also negative for LNGFR (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) and STRO1. The IPFP-derived cells showed chondrogenic differentiation in cell aggregate cultures, and prior expansion with FGF-2 enhanced chondrogenesis. Expansion in FGF-2 resulted in greater downregulation of many cartilage-associated genes, but on subsequent chondrogenic differentiation, they showed stronger upregulation of these genes and this resulted in greater matrix production per cell.CONCLUSION: These results show that these cells express mesenchymal stem cell markers, but further work is needed to determine the true origin of these cells. These results suggest that the expansion of these cells with FGF-2 has important consequences for facilitating their chondrogenic differentiation.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSC) are routinely isolated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of homogenized adipose tissue. Freshly isolated ADSC display surface markers that differ from those of cultured ADSC, but both cell preparations are capable of multipotential differentiation. Recent studies have inferred that these progenitors may reside in a perivascular location where they appeared to coexpress CD34 and smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) but not CD31. However, these studies provided only limited histological evidence to support such assertions. In the present study, we employed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to define more precisely the location of ADSC within human adipose tissue. Our results show that alpha-SMA and CD31 localized within smooth muscle and endothelial cells, respectively, in all blood vessels examined. CD34 localized to both the intima (endothelium) and adventitia neither of which expressed alpha-SMA. The niche marker Wnt5a was confined exclusively to the vascular wall within mural smooth muscle cells. Surprisingly, the widely accepted mesenchymal stem cell marker STRO-1 was expressed exclusively in the endothelium of capillaries and arterioles but not in the endothelium of arteries. The embryonic stem cell marker SSEA1 localized to a pericytic location in capillaries and in certain smooth muscle cells of arterioles. Cells expressing the embryonic stem cell markers telomerase and OCT4 were rare and observed only in capillaries. Based on these findings and evidence gathered from the existing literature, we propose that ADSC are vascular precursor (stem) cells at various stages of differentiation. In their native tissue, ADSC at early stages of differentiation can differentiate into tissue-specific cells such as adipocytes. Isolated, ADSC can be induced to differentiate into additional cell types such as osteoblasts and chondrocytes.</p>

<p>We report 2 cases of surgically resected vulval masses in women aged 27 and 40 years. One patient was wheelchair bound and the other was obese, both presented with bilateral vulvar swelling. One specimen measured 45 cm in maximum dimension and the other 5 cm and were described as grossly edematous or gelatinous. Histologically, in both cases, there was edema of the skin overlying the lesion. The lesion itself consisted of markedly edematous connective tissue with widely separated bland spindle-shaped cells and numerous dilated vascular channels, sometimes surrounded by cuffs of lymphocytes and plasma cells. In the larger of the 2 specimens, underlying edematous adipose tissue was present. To some extent, the appearances, especially the morphological features, mimicked aggressive angiomyxoma because of the presence of a mass, the lack of circumscription, the hypocellular, edematous appearance, and the presence of numerous vascular channels. However, a combination of clinical and pathological features, including bilateralism, lack of a true myxoid stroma, the presence of perivascular cuffs of lymphoid cells, and lack of staining with estrogen receptor, is against aggressive angiomyxoma. The appearances were interpreted as those of massive edema. In one case, there was recurrence of the mass after surgery. There has been a single previous report of a similar vulvar case in a quadriplegic female patient and of similar cases involving the upper and lower extremities of obese patients. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware of the existence of this lesion, which is likely due to lymphatic obstruction and lymphedema secondary to immobilization and obesity.</p>

<p>One of the most profound challenges facing public health and public health policy in Western society is the increased incidence and prevalence of both overweight and obesity. While this condition can have significant consequences for patient mortality and quality of life, it can be further exacerbated as overweight/obesity can be a powerful stimulus for the development of additional risk factors for a negative cardiovascular outcome, including increased insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. This manuscript will present the effects of systemic obesity on broad issues of vascular function in both afflicted human populations and in the most relevant animal models. Among the topics that will be covered are alterations to vascular reactivity (both dilator and constrictor responses), adaptations in microvascular network and vessel wall structure, and alterations to the patterns of tissue/organ perfusion as a result of the progression of the obese condition. Additionally, special attention will be paid to the contribution of chronic inflammation as a contributor to alterations in vascular function, as well as the role of perivascular adipose tissue in terms of impacting vessel behavior. When taken together, it is clearly apparent that the development of the obese condition can have profound, and frequently difficult to predict, impacts on integrated vascular function. Much of this complexity appears to have its basis in the extent to which other co-morbidities associated with obesity (e.g., insulin resistance) are present and exert contributing effects.</p>

<p>We report a very rare case of Wagner-Meissner neurilemmoma in the cheek of a 10-year-old boy. The tumor presented as a slowly growing soft tissue swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a very infiltrative, 9-cm mass involving the subcutis and deep soft tissues of the right cheek. Microscopically, the tumor was unencapsulated and composed almost entirely of well-formed Wagner-Meissner corpuscles that formed confluent sheets, perivascular cuffs, and individual corpuscles percolating through adipose tissue. Compared with the 3 previous reports, which describe circumscribed, encapsulated tumors in adult patients, this case had distinctive clinicopathologic features never reported: presentation in a pediatric patient, location in the head and neck region, and an infiltrative growth pattern.</p>

<p>A growing body of literature suggests that human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs) possess developmental plasticity both in vitro and in vivo, and might represent a viable cell source for therapeutic angiogenesis and tissue engineering. We investigate their phenotypic similarity to perivascular cell types, ability to contribute to in vivo microvascular remodeling, and ability to modulate vascular stability. We evaluated hASC surface expression of vascular and stem/progenitor cell markers in vitro, as well as any effects of platelet-derived growth factor B chain (PDGF-BB) and vascular endothelial growth factor 165 on in vitro hASC migration. To ascertain in vivo behavior of hASCs in an angiogenic environment, hASCs were isolated, expanded in culture, labeled with a fluorescent marker, and injected into adult nude rat mesenteries that were stimulated to undergo microvascular remodeling. Ten, 30, and 60 days after injection, tissues from anesthetized animals were harvested and processed with immunohistochemical techniques to determine hASC quantity, positional fate in relation to microvessels, and expression of endothelial and perivascular cell markers. After 60 days, 29% of hASCs exhibited perivascular morphologies compared with 11% of injected human lung fibroblasts. hASCs exhibiting perivascular morphologies also expressed markers characteristic of vascular pericytes: smooth muscle alpha-actin (10%) and neuron-glia antigen 2 (8%). In tissues treated with hASCs, vascular density was significantly increased over age-matched controls lacking hASCs. This study demonstrates that hASCs express pericyte lineage markers in vivo and in vitro, exhibit increased migration in response to PDGF-BB in vitro, exhibit perivascular morphology when injected in vivo, and contribute to increases in microvascular density during angiogenesis by migrating toward vessels.

<p>OBJECTIVES: Adipose tissue in vocal fold lipoinjection is currently used to treat patients affected by laryngeal hemiplegia or anatomical defects. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the efficacy of this clinical strategy, by long-term follow-up of the patients and to investigate whether the fat samples used to treat them contain a stem cell population with a wide differentiation potential.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fat samples harvested from 12 patients affected by severe breathy dysphonia who had undergone vocal fold lipoinjection were analysed by immunocytochemistry, by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the isolated adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) were evaluated in order to define their ability to produce soluble factors possibly involved in tissue regeneration, and to differentiate towards different lineages.RESULTS: ADMSCs were efficiently and successfully isolated from all of the samples. They were positive for SSEA-4, an embryonic marker recently identified on bone marrow MSCs and which could explain their high differentiation plasticity. Molecular analysis showed that these cells also expressed Oct-4, Runx-1 and ABCG-2, which characterize the stem cell state, and a number of other specific lineage markers. Flow cytometry revealed mesenchymal markers expressed on ADMSCs and identified a subpopulation characterized by CD146(+)/34(-)/45(-) cells consistent with perivascular/pericyte-like cells. Osteogenic, adipogenic and endothelial tissue differentiation were obtained.CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of this clinical approach and showed that adipose tissue, administered to patients in order to restore glottic competence, contains mesenchymal stem cells.</p>

<p>With the growing prevalence of obesity, scientific interest in the biology of adipose tissue has been extended to the secretory products of adipocytes, since they have been shown increasingly to affect several aspects of the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. Until relatively recently, the role of adipose tissue itself in the development of obesity and its consequences was considered to be a passive one. It is now clear that, in addition to storing energy in the form of triglycerides, adipocytes also secrete a large variety of proteins, including cytokines, chemokines and hormone-like factors. This production of proatherogenic chemokines by adipose tissue is of particular interest, since their local secretion, for example by perivascular adipose depots, may provide a novel mechanistic link between obesity and associated vascular complications.</p>

<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the rat adipose tissue expresses some of the components necessary for the production of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the receptors mediating its actions. The aim of this work is to characterize the expression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in perivascular adipose tissue and to assess differences in the expression pattern depending on the vascular bed and type of adipose tissue. We analyzed Ang I and Ang II levels as well as mRNA levels of RAS components by a quantitative RT-PCR method in periaortic (PAT) and mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) of 3-month-old male Wistar-Kyoto rats. PAT was identified as brown adipose tissue expressing uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1). It had smaller adipocytes than those from MAT, which was identified as white adipose tissue. All RAS components, except renin, were detected in both PAT and MAT. Levels of expression of angiotensinogen, Ang-converting enzyme (ACE), and ACE2 were similar between PAT and MAT. Renin receptor expression was five times higher, whereas expression of chymase, AT(1a), and AT(2) receptors were significantly lower in PAT compared with MAT respectively. In addition, three isoforms of the AT(1a) receptor were found in perivascular adipose tissue. The AT(1b) receptor was found at very a low expression level. Ang II levels were higher in MAT with no differences between tissues in Ang I. The results show that the RAS is differentially expressed in white and brown perivascular adipose tissues implicating a different role for the system depending on the vascular bed and the type of adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Increasing evidence supports the role of adipose tissue in the development of a systemic inflammatory state, which contributes to obesity-associated vasculopathy and cardiovascular risk. In addition to storing calories as triglycerides, adipocytes secrete a large variety of proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, and -hormone-like factors (eg, leptin, adiponectin, resistin). This production of pro chemokines by adipose tissue is of particular interest, because their local secretion by perivascular adipose depots may provide a new mechanistic link between obesity and its associated vascular complications. Insulin resistance, in subjects with or without diabetes, is frequently associated with obesity, particularly with an excess of intra-abdominal fat. Recently, the endocannabinoid system, among others, has been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of visceral obesity and global cardiometabolic risk, as represented by the overall risk of developing type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Our view of white adipose tissue (WAT) has changed over the last decade, from an inert triglyceride storage tissue to a highly active metabolic organ. Indeed, WAT secretes proinflammatory cytokines such TNF-a, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interferon gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10), interleukin-8 (IL-8), RANTES, and peptides with hormone-like actions such as adiponectin, leptin and resistin. Through their paracrine actions these factors contribute to local WAT inflammation, neoangiogenesis and differentiation. On entering the systemic circulation they can contribute to creating or maintaining a systemic inflammatory state, hypertension and insulin resistance, and can also affect central control of food intake. When located around organs such as the kidney, heart and blood vessels, WAT can adversely affect organ function by secreting cytokines and chemokines. For example, perivascular WAT which secretes proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines and which is present around large and medium-sized arteries, could contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions by attracting inflammatory cells and stimulating neoangiogenesis, thereby amplifying the chronic vascular inflammation which is the hallmark of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Perivascular adipose tissue AT is a critical regulator of vascular function, which until recently has been greatly overlooked. Virtually all arteries are surrounded by a significant amount of perivascular adipose tissue, which has long been considered to serve primarily a supportive, mechanical purpose. Recent studies show that both visceral and perivascular fat is a very active endocrine and paracrine source of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. The latter include beneficial adipocytokines such as adiponectin or so far unidentified adipocyte derived relaxing factor (ADRF) as the presence of perivascular AT may decrease contractile responses to vasoconstrictive agents. However, in pathological states such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular disorders perivascular tissue becomes dysfunctional and production of protective factors diminishes while detrimental adipocytokines such as leptin, resistin, IL-6, TNF-alpha or IL-17 increases. Moreover the dysfunction of perivascular fat can lead to imbalance between vascular nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide production. Adipokines also regulate immune system as chemokines (such as MIP-1 or RANTES) and induce inflammation with infiltration of T cells and macrophages to the vessel wall. Interestingly central nervous system can affect vascular function through mediation of perivascular adipose tissue dysfunction. In particular sympathetic nervous system endings are present in both visceral and perivascular AT. This powerful relationship between the brain and the vessel can be termed “brain-vessel axis” in which–we propose in the Review–perivascular adipose tissue may take center stage. The role of perivascular fat in the regulation of blood vessels depends on metabolic state, inflammation and clinical risk factors. In health protective and vasorelaxant properties of perivascular AT dominate while in pathology pathogenetic influences including neural stimulation of sympathetic nerve endings or humoral effects of certain hormones and adipocytokines dominates. We propose to term this state “perivascular adipose tissue dysfunction” in similarity to endothelial dysfunction.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: It has been recently suggested that perivascular tissue (PVT) releases hypothetic adipocyte- or adventitia-derived relaxing factor. The aim of the study was to assess anticontractile properties of perivascular tissue of human internal thoracic artery (ITA) and to check if this activity is nitric oxide (NO)- or prostacyclin-dependent. We also analyzed the influence of pleural adipose tissue on ITA reactivity.METHODS: Human ITA rings were studied in vitro. First, skeletonized and pedicled ITA reactivity to serotonin and angiotensin II was compared. In subsequent experiments fragments of ITA were skeletonized and divided into two preparations. One was incubated alone, the other together with PVT or pleural adipose tissue floating freely in the bath. First, concentration-response curves to either serotonin or angiotensin II were constructed. Tissue was then transferred from one bath to the other and concentration-response curves were reconstructed. The same protocol was applied with the inhibition of NO synthase with L-NMMA (10(-4)M) and cyclooxygenase with indomethacin (10(-5)M).RESULTS: Skeletonization augmented contractile response to serotonin (E(max) 16.6+/-1.85 mN vs 43.8+/-3.87 mN; pedicled vs skeletonized ITA, respectively; p&lt;0.001) and angiotensin II (E(max) 10.9+/-1.07 mN vs 26.6+/-1.45 mN, respectively; p&lt;0.001). PVT presence in the bath caused decrease of E(max) from 40.8+/-5.01 to 20.1+/-2.69 mN for serotonin; p&lt;0.001 and from 31.4+/-3.75 to 13.0+/-1.60 mN for angiotensin II, p&lt;0.001 (PVT(-) vs PVT(+), respectively). PVT did not change ITA sensitivity (EC(50)) to serotonin or angiotensin II. Pleural adipose tissue did not change the contractile response of ITA to serotonin (E(max) 37.2+/-4.95 mN vs 36.3+/-4.83 mN, pleural fat+and pleural fat-, respectively; p=0.9). NO and prostacyclin inhibition failed to abolish anticontractile properties of perivascular tissue. PVT with cyclooxygenase and NO synthase inhibition decreased E(max) of serotonin from 46.6+/-3.03 to 28.2+/-4.02 mN, p&lt;0.001 and E(max) of angiotensin II from 27.2+/-2.00 to 16.4+/-2.10 mN, p&lt;0.001.CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular tissue of ITA releases potent, soluble, nitric oxide and prostacyclin-independent anticontractile factor. The pleural adipose tissue does not influence ITA reactivity to vasoconstrictors. Preservation of perivascular tissue may protect against vasospasm of ITA graft in clinical settings.</p>

<p>The authors present a case of multiple glomus tumors (GTs) of the gastrointestinal tract, representing the type of a gastric glomus tumor proper and large bowel glomangiomyomas with myopericytoma-like features, observed in a 46-year old female, with multifocal perivascular proliferations of primitive cells and hepatic involvement. Histologically, the multilobular gastric tumor and hepatic lesions corresponded to a typical glomus tumor, while the tumor situated in the transverse colon, up to 7 cm in diameter, presented as a glomangiomyoma infiltrative (with myopericytoma-like foci), and satellite tumors in the large bowel mucosa, 0.5-0.7 cm in diameter, represented small glomangiomyomas. In addition, the patient demonstrated two types of concomitant vascular lesions: 1/ intravascular spread in the form of neoplastic plugs that obliterated the lumen of medium-size veins, and 2/ microscopic perivascular proliferation of primitive, small cells seen in the vicinity of the main tumor and in the adjacent adipose tissue. The patient has been ill for 2.5 years; she has been subjected to a partial colectomy with a resection of the small intestinal loop, greater omentum and the right ovary, followed by chemotherapy. At present, she is stable, and the infiltration–especially in the epigastric region–has decreased. The picture may confirm the theory that multiple GTs develop in association with multifocal proliferation of perivascular stem cells, as well as that their ability to penetrate into the lumen of large vessels gives origin to satellite tumors, which are not necessarily metastatic. It seems that at present, the group of perivascular SMA+ tumors may include infantile-type myofibromatosis in adults, myopericytoma, glomangio(myo)pericytoma, glomangiomyoma, glomus tumor proper, and glomangioma. Most likely, also some tumors previously classified as hemangiopericytomas belong to this group. The distinctive feature present in at least some of the above listed perivascular tumors is their synchronous or metachronous growth in a particular region and their ability to occupy intravascular space as nodules or solid bands, which in turn may give origin to satellite tumors. Multifocal lesions associated with a short survival in a given patient will obviously support the presence of metastatic disease. In the remaining cases, determination whether the patient has metastatic disease requires deep consideration and caution, also while deciding on treatment to be employed.</p>

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that PAT of porcine coronary artery blunts constriction similarly and that this anticontractile effect of PAT is altered by diet and/or exercise training.</AbstractText>: Perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) has been reported to blunt agonist-induced arterial tone via a relaxing factor acting in a paracrine manner. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that PAT of porcine coronary artery blunts constriction similarly and that this anticontractile effect of PAT is altered by diet and/or exercise training.METHODS: Fourteen adult male pigs were fed a normal-fat (NF) diet, and 10 adult male pigs were fed a high-fat/cholesterol (HF) diet. Four weeks after the initiation of diet, pigs were exercised (EX) or remained sedentary (SED) for 16 wk, yielding four groups: 1) NF-SED, 2) NF-EX, 3) HF-SED, and 4) HF-EX. Left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) rings were prepared with PAT left intact or removed. LCX reactivity to acetylcholine (ACh), endothelin (ET-1), bradykinin (BK), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was assessed in vitro using standard techniques.RESULTS: The results demonstrate that both ACh and ET-1 elicited dose-dependent increases in tension from LCX rings from all groups. Removal of PAT had no significant effect on ACh-induced contractions in any group. In contrast, removal of PAT increased ET-1-induced tension in LCX from NF-SED, HF-SED, and HF-EX but not NF-EX. PAT had no significant effect on relaxation responses to BK except in HF-EX animals, where removal of PAT increased BK-induced relaxation. PAT removal decreased SNP-induced relaxation in HF-LCX, but not LCX from NF pigs, suggesting basal release of a relaxing factor LCX from HF pigs.CONCLUSION: PAT blunts contractions induced by ET-1 in LCX from NF and HF pigs. Whereas EX abolished this effect of PAT in NF pigs, exercise did not alter the anticontractile effect in HF pigs.</p>

<p>Following transplantation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled bone marrow (BM) into irradiated, wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats, propagated GFP(+) cells migrate to adipose tissue compartments. To determine the relationship between GFP(+) BM-derived cells and tissue-resident GFP(-) cells on the stem cell population of adipose tissue, we conducted detailed immunohistochemical analysis of chimeric whole fat compartments and subsequently isolated and characterized adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) from GFP(+) BM chimeras. In immunohistochemistry, a large fraction of GFP(+) cells in adipose tissue were strongly positive for CD45 and smooth muscle actin and were evenly scattered around the adipocytes and blood vessels, whereas all CD45(+) cells within the blood vessels were GFP(+). A small fraction of GFP(+) cells with the mesenchymal marker CD90 also existed in the perivascular area. Flow cytometric and immunocytochemical analyses showed that cultured ASCs were CD45(-)/CD90(+)/CD29(+). There was a significant difference in both the cell number and phenotype of the GFP(+) ASCs in two different adipose compartments, the omental (abdominal) and the inguinal (subcutaneous) fat pads; a significantly higher number of GFP(-)/CD90(+) cells were isolated from the subcutaneous depot as compared with the abdominal depot. The in vitro adipogenic differentiation of the ASCs was achieved; however, all cells that had differentiated were GFP(-). Based on phenotypical analysis, GFP(+) cells in adipose tissue in this rat model appear to be of both hematopoietic and mesenchymal origin; however, infrequent isolation of GFP(+) ASCs and their lack of adipogenic differentiation suggest that the contribution of BM to ASC generation might be minor.</p>

<p>Hypertension promotes atherosclerosis and is a major source of morbidity and mortality. We show that mice lacking T and B cells (RAG-1-/- mice) have blunted hypertension and do not develop abnormalities of vascular function during angiotensin II infusion or desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt. Adoptive transfer of T, but not B, cells restored these abnormalities. Angiotensin II is known to stimulate reactive oxygen species production via the nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in several cells, including some immune cells. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of T cells lacking the angiotensin type I receptor or a functional NADPH oxidase resulted in blunted angiotensin II-dependent hypertension and decreased aortic superoxide production. Angiotensin II increased T cell markers of activation and tissue homing in wild-type, but not NADPH oxidase-deficient, mice. Angiotensin II markedly increased T cells in the perivascular adipose tissue (periadventitial fat) and, to a lesser extent the adventitia. These cells expressed high levels of CC chemokine receptor 5 and were commonly double negative (CD3+CD4-CD8-). This infiltration was associated with an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and RANTES in the aorta. Hypertension also increased T lymphocyte production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and treatment with the TNFalpha antagonist etanercept prevented the hypertension and increase in vascular superoxide caused by angiotensin II. These studies identify a previously undefined role for T cells in the genesis of hypertension and support a role of inflammation in the basis of this prevalent disease. T cells might represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of high blood pressure.</p>

<p>Although nearly all arteries are surrounded by perivascular fat, its role in vascular function and disease is clearly understudied. At least one type of perivascular fat, epicardial adipose tissue, appears to be related to both weight and age and tends to express proatherogenic/proinflammatory products in subjects with cardiovascular disease. Perivascular fat may evolve from primordial cells in the adventitia or from circulating precursors migrating through the arterial wall. Once deposited periarterially, adipose tissue may release locally a large number of products, which potentially interact with the arterial wall. Additionally, the authors propose that perivascular fat, per se, may attract circulating monocytes through the release of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Some of the macrophages traversing the arterial wall en route to the perivascular fat may be redirected and eventually populate the arterial wall itself, thereby enhancing vascular inflammatory processes and accelerating atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem-like cells identified in different tissues reside in a perivascular niche. In the present study, we investigated the putative niche of adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) using markers, associated with mesenchymal and perivascular cells, including STRO-1, CD146, and 3G5. Immunofluorescence staining of human adipose tissue sections, revealed that STRO-1 and 3G5 co-localized with CD146 to the perivascular regions of blood vessels. FACS was used to determine the capacity of the CD146, 3G5, and STRO-1 specific monoclonal antibodies to isolate clonogenic ASCs from disassociated human adipose tissue. Clonogenic fibroblastic colonies (CFU-F) were found to be enriched in those cell fractions selected with either STRO-1, CD146, or 3G5. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cultured ASCs exhibited similar phenotypic profiles in relation to their expression of cell surface markers associated with stromal cells (CD44, CD90, CD105, CD106, CD146, CD166, STRO-1, alkaline phosphatase), endothelial cells (CD31, CD105, CD106, CD146, CD166), haematopoietic cells (CD14, CD31, CD45), and perivascular cells (3G5, STRO-1, CD146). The immunoselected ASCs populations maintained their characteristic multipotential properties as shown by their capacity to form Alizarin Red positive mineralized deposits, Oil Red O positive lipid droplets, and Alcian Blue positive proteoglycan-rich matrix in vitro. Furthermore, ASCs cultures established from either STRO-1, 3G5, or CD146 selected cell populations, were all capable of forming ectopic bone when transplanted subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice. The findings presented here, describe a multipotential stem cell population within adult human adipose tissue, which appear to be intimately associated with perivascular cells surrounding the blood vessels.</p>

<p>C57BL/6J strain mice carrying the homozygous autosomal recessive mutation alymphoplasia (aly) lack peripheral lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches and exhibit chronic infiltration of lymphocytes into various organs. Pancreatitis, one of the inflammatory lesions, is considered to be of autoimmune origin; however, the target autoantigens have not yet been determined. In this study, pancreatic tissues of male aly/aly mice and wild-type mice at 1-65 weeks of age were light- and electron-microscopically examined to investigate when and how pancreatitis develops. The results showed that macrophages had first appeared and remained in the lymphatic lumen at 3 weeks of age and then a lot of eosinophilic granulocytes infiltrated into the interlobular connective tissues at 5 weeks of age. After the subsidence of eosinophilic inflammation, macrophages and B220+ cells appeared at the perivascular tissues at 9 weeks of age. Thereafter, both CD4+ and CD8+ cells finally participated in the interstitial inflammation from 11 weeks of age. It was noted that these leukocytes had infiltrated into the perivascular interstitium rather than the parenchymal tissues during the course of pancreatitis, although a large parenchymal area was finally degenerated and replaced by adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Almost every systemic vessel is surrounded by a layer of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which had been mainly considered as a mechanical support for vasculature. However, recent advances have revealed that PVAT is an active player in controlling vessel function. PVAT releases relaxation factor(s) with unknown chemical identity (named perivascular adipocyte-derived relaxation factor, PVRF) that attenuates vasoconstriction to various agonists including phenylephrine, serotonin, angiotensin II, and U 46619 (a thromboxane A(2) mimic), through activation of K(+) channels. PVAT also promotes vasoconstriction to perivascular nerve stimulation by producing vasoconstrictor or facilitator (named perivascular adipocyte-derived constricting factor, PVCF), which includes superoxide and was mediated through activation of tyrosine kinase and MAPK/ERK pathways. Therefore, PVAT has a dual regulatory role in modulating vessel function, attenuating vasoconstriction to agonists by PVRF and promoting constriction to perivascular nerve excitation by PVCF. In vivo, normal amount of PVAT (total body fat as well) is likely to be important in maintaining the homeostasis of vascular tone and blood pressure, since lipoatrophic mice developed hypertension. On the other end, excessive accumulation of body fat (obesity) impaired PVRF production/action, despite an increase in the amount of PVAT. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, an animal model of hypertension without obesity, the ability of PVAT to attenuate vasoconstriction to agonists was reduced, and treatment with atorvastatin improved PVAT function. PVAT, vasodilating and constricting factors of PVAT origin, and signalling pathways of these factors may represent new targets for developing new strategies to treat vascular disorders associated with abnormal adiposity.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Perivascular adipose tissue secretes an adipocyte-derived relaxing factor(s) (ADRF) that opens K(v) channels in rat arteries. Visceral fat accumulation causes adipocyte dysfunction, including hyposecretion of adiponectin. We tested the hypothesis that ADRF might be adiponectin and that adiponectin plays a role in the paracrine control of vascular tone by perivascular adipose tissue.METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied Sprague-Dawley rats, wild-type and adiponectin gene-deficient (Apn 1-/-) mice, and New Zealand obese (NZO) mice. In rat aortas, recombinant adiponectin at serum levels (2-5 microg/ml) inhibited serotonin-induced contractions. The effects were abolished by K(v) channel inhibition with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 2 mM). Similar effects were observed in NZO mouse mesenteric arteries. To study vascular function in Apn 1-/- mice, the mesenteric vascular bed was isolated, cannulated, and perfused at a constant 4-5-ml/min flow in the absence and presence of serotonin. 4-AP (2 mM) induced a similar increase in perfusion pressure in the Apn 1-/- perfused isolated mesenteric vascular bed, compared to wild-type mice. Removal of perivascular fat increased the vasoconstrictor responses, but abolished the 4-AP effects. The anti-contractile effects of perivascular fat were similar in mesenteric artery and aortic rings from Apn 1-/- and wild-type mice. Despite high adiponectin levels, the anti-contractile effects of perivascular fat were diminished in mesenteric arteries of NZO mice with age.CONCLUSION: Adiponectin is a novel humoral vasodilator that relaxes aortic and mesenteric rings by opening K(v) channels. Similar to the rat, perivascular adipose tissue of the mouse harbors an ADRF, which is malfunctional in NZO mice and is not adiponectin.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with insulin resistance, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms underlying these associations are incompletely understood. Microvascular dysfunction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of both insulin resistance and hypertension in obesity. Adipose tissue-derived substances (adipokines) and especially inflammatory products of adipose tissue control insulin sensitivity and vascular function. Recently, adipose tissue associated with the arterial tree, called perivascular adipose tissue (PAT) has been shown to produce a variety of adipokines and to trigger vascular inflammation. This review summarizes the mechanisms linking adipose tissue to (micro)vascular function, inflammation and insulin resistance with a special focus on the role of PAT in the regulation of vascular tone, endothelial function, inflammation and insulin sensitivity.</p>

<p>With the growing prevalence of obesity and impaired glycemic control, and the correlation between these conditions and an elevated predisposition for the development of vascular disease, research emphases are increasingly being targeted to the mechanistic bases and functional outcomes of these relationships. Given this, the current issue of Microcirculation, presents a series of reviews that summarize knowledge on an array of topics relevant to obesity, insulin resistance, and vascular dysfunction. The first chapters discuss altered patterns of blood flow regulation, vascular reactivity, microvascular density, and vascular wall mechanics. The second grouping details alterations to coronary, renal, and hepatic circulations and the implications of these effects for organ function. Additionally, one article presents knowledge and outlines future research directions for the study of endothelial permeability and barrier function within insulin resistance. The last group of articles discusses the effects of inflammation with obesity and insulin resistance on vascular function, and also details the role of perivascular adipose tissue in contributing to vascular dysfunction. The final review extends this general topic to the effects of the metabolic syndrome on microvascular dysfunction, wherein obesity and impaired glycemic control are contributing elements to a larger constellation of systemic pathologies. The authors hope that this Special Topics Issue will be informative for its readers and will provide a basis for future investigation into microvasculopathy in obesity and insulin-resistance.</p>

<p>Insulin resistance, both in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects, is frequently associated with obesity, particularly with an excess of central fat. With the growing prevalence of obesity, scientific interest in the biology of adipose tissue has been extended to the secretory products of adipocytes, since they are increasingly shown to influence several aspects in the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases Until relatively recently, the role of fat itself in the development of obesity and its consequences was considered to be a passive one; adipocytes were considered to be little more than storage cells for fat. It is now clear that, in addition to storing calories as triglycerides, they also secrete a large variety of proteins, including cytokines, chemokines and hormone-like factors, such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin. This production of pro-atherogenic chemokines by adipose tissue is of particular interest since their local secretion, e.g. by perivascular adipose depots, may provide a novel mechanistic link between obesity and the associated vascular complications. Recent research has revealed many functions of adipocytokines extending far beyond metabolism, such as immunity, cancer and bone formation. This remarkable understanding is allowing us to more clearly define the role that adipocytes play in health and in obesity and how inflammatory mediators act as signaling molecules in this process. Moreover, on a molecular level, we are beginning to comprehend how such variables as hormonal control, exercise, food intake, and genetic variation interact and result in a given phenotype, and how pharmacological intervention may modulate adipose tissue biology.</p>

<p>Obesity is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although obesity-associated hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance account in part for this association, it becomes increasingly apparent that a systemic and local pro-inflammatory response of adipose tissue might also be a contributing factor. White adipose tissue (WAT) is a highly active organ secreting various peptides such as cytokines, chemokines and hormone-like proteins. Besides the visceral and subcutaneous depots, WAT is also found in the close vicinity of blood vessels (perivascular adipose tissue), where it secretes cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, pro-atherogenic chemokines, and pro-angiogenic peptides. These factors appear to contribute directly to alterations of the function and structure of the vascular wall, including chronic inflammation, alterations of vascular tone, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, neo-angiogenesis and hence to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) attenuates vascular contraction, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. The possible involvement of endothelium (E) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was investigated.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Aortic rings from Wistar rats were prepared with both PVAT and E intact (PVAT+ E+), with either PVAT or E removed (PVAT- E+, or PVAT+ E-), or with both removed (PVAT- E-) for functional studies. Nitric oxide (NO) production was measured.KEY RESULTS: Contraction to phenylephrine and 5-HT respectively was highest in PVAT- E-, lowest in PVAT+ E+, and intermediate in PVAT+ E- or PVAT- E+. In bioassay experiments, transferring bathing solution incubated with a PVAT+ ring (donor) to a PVAT- ring (recipient) induced relaxation in the recipient. This relaxation was abolished by E removal, NO synthase inhibition, scavenging of NO, high extracellular K+, or blockade of calcium-dependent K+ channels (K(Ca)). The solution stimulated NO production in isolated endothelial cells and in PVAT- E+ rings. In E- rings, the contraction to phenylephrine of PVAT+ rings but not PVAT- rings was enhanced by catalase or soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor, but reduced by superoxide dismutase and tiron. In PVAT- E- rings, H2O2 attenuated phenylephrine-induced contraction. This effect was counteracted by sGC inhibition. NO donor and H2O2 exhibited additive inhibition of the contraction to phenylephrine in PVAT- E- rings.CONCLUSION: PVAT exerts its anti-contractile effects through two distinct mechanisms: (1) by releasing a transferable relaxing factor which induces endothelium-dependent relaxation through NO release and subsequent K(Ca) channel activation, and (2) by an endothelium-independent mechanism involving H2O2 and subsequent activation of sGC.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue releases several hormones and autacoids and expansion of the adipose tissue and excessive obesity is a risk factor for hypertension. Perivascular adipose tissue, on the other hand, has been reported to lower the vascular tone through the release of a transferable, thermosensitive, non-lipid factor. In this issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, Gao et al. (2007) report that a factor generated by the adipose tissue also stimulates the generation of NO by endothelium and that NO is the predominant mediator of adipose tissue-induced relaxation in endothelium-intact vessels.</p>

<p>AIMS: The saphenous vein is commonly used for coronary artery bypass surgery but its patency is poor. Vascular damage occurs during conventional surgery. However, patency improves when the graft is harvested with minimal surgical trauma, partly due to preservation of vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and tissue sources of nitric oxide (NO), a factor possessing both dilatory and anti-proliferative properties. Apart from these grafts exhibiting an intact luminal endothelium they are harvested complete with a surrounding cushion of tissue, much of which is fat.METHODS: Immunostaining for eNOS was performed on vein graft sections and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to identify eNOS mRNA and protein. NO synthase activity was measured using the citrulline assay.RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry identified eNOS staining of vein graft segments, including dense staining of the cushion of perivascular fat and associated structures surrounding the vein. eNOS protein was confirmed in both the vein and surrounding fat by Western blot analysis. Using the citrulline assay, the perivascular fat and underlying vein possessed comparable NO synthase activity.CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that perivascular fat-derived NO plays a beneficial role in saphenous veins harvested atraumatically and used as grafts in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a mixed mesenchymal tumor belonging to the family of perivascular epithelioid cell tumors. Concurrent development of AML and adult renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is very rare. Herein is presented a unique case in which RCC arose within a previously detected AML tumor mass. A 40-year-old woman had been diagnosed with AML of the right kidney. Fifteen years later, during a regular radiographic examination, a new lesion was detected at the lower pole of the right kidney adjacent to the previously described AML. Because RCC was clinically suspected, the patient underwent right nephrectomy. Macroscopically, the tumor had a yellowish, transparent, fatty area and an opaque yellowish area with cystic features. Microscopically, the former tumor, consisting of an admixture of mature adipose tissue with smooth muscle and vascular tissue, was diagnosed as AML. The latter tumor was diagnosed as RCC (clear cell type). RCC was not completely enclosed within the AML, but overlapped it. No fibrous capsule was found between these tumors. Although this situation is very rare, from a clinical and pathological point of view it is important to consider the possibility that RCC might arise within AML. The relationship between the two lesions is discussed with a review of the literature.</p>

<p>The role of perivascular fat in the control of vascular function was studied using lipoatrophic A-ZIP/F1 transgenic mice. Only a small amount of brown fat was found around the aorta but not around mesenteric arteries. Blood pressure of A-ZIP/F1 mice became higher than wild-type (WT) mice from 10 weeks of age. The presence of perivascular fat reduced the contraction of WT aorta to phenylephrine and serotonin, whereas this effect was either absent or less prominent in A-ZIP/F1 aorta. In WT mice, transfer of solution incubated with aorta with fat to aorta with fat removed caused a relaxation response, but not in A-ZIP/F1 mice, indicating the release of a relaxation factor from perivascular fat in WT aorta. This factor was acting through the activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels. Perfusion of phenylephrine to the isolated mesenteric bed caused a higher increase in perfusion pressure in A-ZIP/F1 than in WT mice. Contractile response of aorta to angiotensin II (Ang II) was mediated by Ang II type 1 receptors and was higher in A-ZIP/F1 than in WT mice. Expression of Ang II type 1 receptors but not Ang II type 2 receptors was higher in aorta of A-ZIP/F1 than WT mice. Treatment with an Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist (TCV 116, 10 mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks normalized the blood pressure of A-ZIP/F1 mice. These results suggest that the absence of perivascular fat tissue, which enhances the contractile response of the blood vessels to agonists, and an upregulation of vascular Ang II type 1 receptors in A-ZIP/F1 mice, are some of the mechanisms underlying the blood pressure elevation in these lipoatrophic mice.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the effects of statin therapy on progressive insulin resistance (IR) and its consequences, in the present study a rat model of spontaneously developing type II diabetes mellitus (DM) was used to examine the impact of atorvastatin (AS) vs pravastatin (PS).METHODS AND RESULTS: The Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats were either untreated or treated with 100 mg/kg per day of AS or PS from 6 weeks of age for 24 weeks. AS achieved much greater lipid lowering than PS. Serial oral glucose tolerance tests revealed new-onset diabetes was delayed by PS only. The untreated rats exhibited a progressive decrease in plasma adiponectin, increases in plasma leptin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and reduction of plasma nitric oxide (NO), which were limited more by PS than AS. PS, but not AS, enhanced adiponectin mRNA expression in white adipose tissue at 30 weeks. Cardiac endothelial NO synthase expression was upregulated, and overexpression of both transforming growth factor-beta1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA was limited more by PS than AS. Coronary perivascular fibrosis at 30 weeks was suppressed only by PS, which was accompanied by preserved left ventricular diastolic function assessed with Doppler echocardiography.CONCLUSIONS: The moderate lipid lowering by PS, but not the intensive lipid lowering by AS, prevented new-onset DM and diastolic dysfunction in a rat model of IR, and this was associated with preferable adipocytokine profiles and cardiac redox states.</p>

<p>AIM: Improvement in short-term patency of vein grafts harvested with the surrounding tissue and no distention has been noted. The influence of transient tangential stress on mechanical function to vasoactive agents in isolated human saphenous veins stripped or with attached perivascular adipose tissue was assessed.METHODS: Concentration-response curves to noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, methylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and nicardipine were constructed for veins exposed to no, low (approximately 120 mmHg) or high (approximately 240 mmHg) tangential stress.RESULTS: Tangential stress did not affect contractile effects of noradrenaline or relaxant effects of methylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Regression analysis of the concentration-response curve to 5-hydroxytryptamine revealed a significant (P=0.042) increase in sensitivity in saphenous veins without perivascular adipose tissue exposed to no tangential stress, compared with veins with attached adipose tissue. Exposure to high stress significantly (P=0.024) increased the potency of 5-hydroxytryptamine in blood vessels without perivascular adipose tissue, as opposed to veins with adipose tissue. Relaxant responses to nicardipine in veins with perivascular adipose tissue were significantly (P=0.001) affected by exposure to low tangential stress compared with no or high tangential stress. A parallel comparison revealed that intact veins compared with those without perivascular adipose tissue exposed to low stress were significantly (P=0.020) more resistant to the relaxant effects of nicardipine.CONCLUSION: The findings of the present report support the view that tangential stress has an impact on the actions of vasoactive agents, but this influence is variable and factor(s) released from perivascular adipose tissue may have a bearing on the observed effect.</p>

<p>Increasing evidence indicates that fat tissue can provide a novel source of progenitor cells with therapeutic potential. Here, the fate of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) transplanted into the mouse ischemic cortex was monitored in the long term using in vivo imaging, and subsequently characterized. The left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded in C57BL/6J mice equipped with a closed cranial window chronically implanted over the left parietal cortex (n = 20). ADSCs expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (approximately 18 x 10(3) cells in 0.5 microl) were transplanted into the ipsilateral cortex, 24 h after MCA occlusion. GFP+-ADSCs were monitored through the window using confocal fluorescence microscopy to assess their single fate in vivo. Co-localization of GFP with vascular, neuronal, glial or proliferation markers was investigated immunohistochemically. Repeated in vivo imaging revealed that GFP+-ADSCs migrated over 1 week toward the lesion, survived for at least 4 weeks, and exhibited a particular tropism for vessels. About 5% of the transplanted GFP+-ADSCs were scattered in the peri-ischemic area on histological sections. Immunohistochemistry evidenced that perivascular GFP+-ADSCs enfolded CD31-labeled endothelial cells, always outside their basal lamina, and occasionally expressed smooth muscle alpha-actin. Less than 1% GFP and BrdU co-labeling indicated a low proliferation rate of ADSCs. These results demonstrate that cerebral ischemia induces ADSCs survival, migration toward the lesion, especially toward microvessels, and occasional differentiation into smooth muscle cells.</p>

<p>Angiomyofibroblastoma is a rare, usually small benign mesenchymal tumor that occurs in vulvar lesions of premenopausal women. A case of angiomyofibroblastoma that arose as a unique pedunculated and particularly large mass in the left vulva of a 48-year-old woman is presented herein. The patient had been aware of a gradually enlarged mass of 7 years duration without any other gynecological symptoms or signs. The maximum dimension of the tumor measured 11 cm. The resected tumor was well circumscribed with a bulging and glistening cut surface. Histological examination revealed an admixture of irregularly distributed hypercellular and hypocellular areas with spindled, plump spindled, or plasmacytoid stromal cells and abundant venular or capillary-sized vessels. Stromal cells characteristically cluster around delicate vessels within an edematous to collagenous matrix. In the present case, intralesional adipose tissue was present throughout the tumor. There was no significant nuclear atypia, and mitotic figures were very sparse. There was little stromal mucin throughout the tumor. Immunohistochemically, the stromal cells were characterized by strong reactivity for vimentin and CD34, with focal reactivity for desmin and alpha smooth muscle actin. Both estrogen and progesterone receptors were diffusely expressed in the stromal cells. These histological findings are consistent with angiomyofibroblastoma and support the hypothesis that angiomyofibroblastoma originates from perivascular stem cells with a capacity for myofibroblastic and fatty differentiation.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have demonstrated that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) releases vascular relaxation factor(s). In this study, we examined if PVAT releases other vasoactive factors in response to perivascular nerve activation by electrical field stimulation (EFS).METHODS AND RESULTS: In Wistar-Kyoto rats, rings of superior mesenteric artery (MA) with intact PVAT (PVAT (+)) showed a greater contractile response to EFS than rings with PVAT removed (PVAT (-)). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) reduced the contractile response to EFS more in PVAT (+) MA than in PVAT (-) MA. Inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase and cyclooxygenase exerted a greater inhibition on EFS-induced contraction in PVAT (+) MA than in PVAT (-) MA. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (tyrphostin A25) and MAPK/ERK (U 0126) attenuated EFS-induced contraction in PVAT (+) MA in a concentration-related manner, while inactive forms of these inhibitors (tyrphostin A1 and U 0124) did not inhibit the response. Exogenous superoxide augmented the contractile response to EFS and to phenylephrine in PVAT (-) MA, and this augmentation was blunted by inhibition of tyrosine kinase and MAPK/ERK. EFS increased superoxide generation in isolated PVAT and PVAT (+)/(-) MA, which was attenuated by NAD(P)H oxidase inhibition. RT-PCR showed the mRNA expression of p(67phox) subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase and immunohistochemical staining confirmed its localization in the adipocytes of PVAT.CONCLUSION: These results show that PVAT enhances the arterial contractile response to perivascular nerve stimulation through the production of superoxide mediated by NAD(P)H oxidase, and that this enhancement involves activation of tyrosine kinase and MAPK/ERK pathway.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Perivascular adipose tissue of normotensive rats releases a transferable factor that induces relaxation by opening voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels. The relevance of these observations to hypertension is unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized mesenteric perivascular adipose tissue from 3-month-old Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and aged-matched spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Mesenteric bed (MB) weight and MB total lipid content were lower in SHR than in WKY. Freshly isolated MB adipocytes were smaller in SHR. Plasma triglycerides, glycerol, nonesterified free-fatty acids, and cholesterol were also lower in SHR. Plasma and mesenteric leptin were correlated with the quantity of mesenteric fat. To study vascular function, the MB was cannulated and perfused at a constant 2 mL/min flow. The Kv channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 2 mmol/L) increased perfusion pressure less in SHR MB than WKY and was directly correlated with the mesenteric fat amount. In isolated mesenteric artery rings, 4-AP (2 mmol/L) induced a contractile effect that was attenuated in SHR compared with WKY. The anticontractile effects of perivascular fat were reduced in SHR mesenteric artery rings compared with WKY.CONCLUSIONS: Differences in visceral perivascular adipose tissue mass and function may contribute to the increased vascular resistance observed in SHR.</p>

<p>In obesity, an inflammatory process of the adipose tissue has been hypothesized; however, direct evidence for a tissue lesion is still lacking. Macrophage infiltration in the adipose tissue of obese individuals seems to be proven, but other alterations of the tissue have not been demonstrated. Moreover, in humans it has not been clarified whether inflammation is an early characteristic of obesity, because no data from obese children are available. In the present study, we assessed the inflammatory involvement of the adipose tissue and identified the elementary “inflammatory” lesion in a group of obese children. The study of children gives us the chance to investigate adipose tissue during early phases of obesity. In all the obese subjects, ultramicroscopic analysis of the adipose tissue demonstrated inflammatory involvement, and the extent of the lesions seemed to depend on the SD score of body mass index. The elementary lesion is a microgranuloma, with fragments of adipocytes, that evolves to fibrosis. Macrophages (and less frequently, lymphocytes or granulocytes) were found in perivascular positions. The lesions were not found in nonobese children. Our study proved that an “inflammatory” process exists in the adipose tissue of obese children, confirming previous findings in animals and obese adults and demonstrating that it is an early alteration in humans. However, the accumulation of macrophages was just one of the components of the inflammatory lesion, which also involved adipocyte degeneration, fibrosis, and, to a lesser extent, granulocyte/lymphocyte accumulation. The finding of fragments of adipocytes in the elementary lesion suggests that, at the beginning of the process, adipocytes may degenerate and that the materials generated by this process can recruit macrophages and other leukocytes. These preliminary results suggest that additional studies should be designed to clarify the cause of adipocyte fragility in obese children.</p>

Clinical records and pathology slides of the patients were reviewed retrospectively. A striking common clinical feature was a pruritic papule, nodule, or plaque with a smooth surface on the head and neck. The histologic patterns were diverse, MF-like, perivascular/periadnexal, nodular, diffuse, pseudolymphomatous folliculitis, and acral pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma of children (APACHE) patterns. The most common pattern was a multinodular pattern with an extension into the deep dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The differentiation between cutaneous lymphomas and pseudolymphomas must depend on a constellation of criteria, never on a single criterion.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue is a highly active organ. In addition to storing calories as triglycerides, it also secretes a large variety of proteins, including cytokines, chemokines and hormone-like factors, such as leptin, adiponectin and resistin. Intriguingly, many, if not most, of these adipose-derived proteins have dual actions; cytokines have both immunomodulatory functions and act as systemic or auto-/paracrine regulators of metabolism, while proteins such as leptin and adiponectin are regulators of both metabolism and inflammation. The production of pro-atherogenic chemokines by adipose tissue is of particular interest since their local secretion, e.g. by perivascular adipose depots, may provide a novel mechanistic link between obesity and the associated vascular complications.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that perivascular adipose tissue from the rat aorta secretes a substance that can dilate the aorta. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether this vasodilator is also present in human internal thoracic arteries.METHODS: Vascular function of human internal thoracic arteries with and without perivascular adipose tissue was assessed with wire myography, and morphology was examined with light microscopy.RESULTS: The presence of perivascular adipose tissue attenuated the maximal contraction to U 46619 and the contraction to phenylephrine (1 micromol/L) by 37% and 24%, respectively. Transfer of the solution incubated with a perivascular adipose tissue-intact vessel (donor) to a vessel without perivascular adipose tissue (recipient) induced a significant relaxation (36%) in the recipient artery precontracted with phenylephrine. Transfer of incubation solution with perivascular adipose tissue alone also induced a relaxation response in the recipient vessel (37%). The relaxation of the recipient artery induced by the transfer of incubation solution from the donor (artery with intact perivascular adipose tissue or perivascular adipose tissue alone) was absent in vessels precontracted by KCl (60 mmol/L) and was prevented by calcium-dependent potassium channel blockers (tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mmol/L; iberiotoxin, 100 nmol/L), but not by the voltage-dependent potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (1 mmol/L) and the adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channel blocker glibenclamide (10 micromol/L).CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular adipose tissue in human internal thoracic arteries releases a transferable relaxation factor that acts through the activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels. Because perivascular adipose tissue is often removed in coronary artery bypass grafting, retaining perivascular adipose tissue might be helpful in reducing the occurrence of vasospasm of the graft vessels.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Histological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT.CONCLUSIONS: Human pWAT has chemotactic properties through the secretion of different chemokines, and we propose that pWAT might contribute to the progression of obesity-associated atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipomas are rare lesions, often arising in the kidney, and are part of a group of tumours with a diverse appearance and evidence of dual melanocytic and smooth muscle differentiation known as PEComas (tumours of perivascular epithelioid cell origin). This report describes an unusual case of a colonic PEComa in a 40 year old woman. Unlike most of the previous colonic angiomyolipomas/PEComas reported in the literature, this case formed a large, mainly extrinsic mass and was monotypic, and composed entirely of the myomatous component with no adipose tissue or typical vasculature.</p>

<p>We report here a case with hypereosinophilia and peripheral artery occlusion. A 32-yr-old Korean woman presented to us with lower extremity swelling and pain. Angiography revealed that multiple lower extremity arteries were occlusive. The biopsy specimen showed perivascular and periadnexal dense eosinophilic infiltration in dermis and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Laboratory investigations revealed a persistent hypereosinophilia. She was prescribed prednisolone 60 mg daily. Her skin lesion and pain were improved and the eosinophil count was dramatically decreased. After discharge, eosinophil count gradually increased again. Cyanosis and pain of her fingers recurred. She had been treated with cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. Her eosinophilia was decreased, but the cyanosis and tingling sense were progressive. The extremity arterial stenoses were slightly progressed. Skin biopsy showed perivascular eosinophilic infiltration in the dermis and CD40 ligand (CD40L) positive eosinophilic infiltration. The serum TNF-alpah was markedly increased. These results suggest that CD40L (a member of TNF-alpah superfamily) could play a role in the inflammatory processes when eosinophil infiltration and activation are observed. We prescribed prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, clopidogrel, cilostazol, beraprost and nifedipine, and she was discharged.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: To retrospectively identify and describe the imaging features that represent perivascular fatty infiltration of the liver.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved the study and waived informed consent. The study complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Ten patients (seven women, three men; mean age, 78 years; range, 31-78 years) with fatty infiltration surrounding hepatic veins and/or portal tracts were retrospectively identified by searching the abdominal imaging teaching file of an academic hospital. The patients’ medical records were reviewed by one author. Computed tomographic (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and ultrasonographic (US) imaging studies were reviewed by three radiologists in consensus. Fatty infiltration of the liver on CT images was defined as absolute attenuation less than 40 HU without mass effect and, if unenhanced images were available, as relative attenuation at least 10 HU less than that of the spleen; on gradient-echo MR images, it was defined as signal loss on opposed-phase images compared with in-phase images; and on US images, it was defined as hyperechogenicity of liver relative to kidney, ultrasound beam attenuation, and poor visualization of intrahepatic structures. Perivascular fatty infiltration of the liver was defined as a clear predisposition to fat accumulation around hepatic veins and/or portal tracts. For multiphase CT images, the contrast-to-noise ratio was calculated for comparison of spared liver with fatty liver in each imaging phase.RESULTS: Fatty infiltration surrounded hepatic veins in three, portal tracts in five, and both hepatic veins and portal tracts in two patients. Six of the 10 patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, two reported regular alcohol consumption (one of whom had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis B), one was positive for human immunodeficiency virus, and one had no risk factors for fatty infiltration of the liver. In three of the 10 patients, fatty infiltration was misdiagnosed as vascular or neoplastic disease on initial CT images but was correctly diagnosed on MR images.CONCLUSION: Perivascular fatty infiltration of the liver has imaging features that allow its recognition.</p>

<p>Adipocytes and perivascular adipose tissue are emerging as regulators of vascular function. The effects of adipocytes and perivascular adipose tissue on human smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation were investigated. Conditioned medium was prepared from cultured premature and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from periaortic adipose tissue from young (3 mo) and old (24 mo) Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, lean and obese Zucker rats (3 mo), and WKY rats fed normal chow or a high-fat diet for 3 mo. Conditioned medium from differentiated (but not premature) adipocytes stimulated SMC proliferation, which was abolished by charcoal and proteinase K treatment but was resistant to heat, trypsin, or phospholipase B (to hydrolyze lysophosphatidic acid). Further experiments demonstrated that the growth factor(s) are hydrosoluble and present in the fraction of molecular mass &gt;100 kDa. Moreover, conditioned medium from periaortic adipose tissue stimulated SMC proliferation, which was significantly enhanced in aged rats and in rats fed a high-fat diet but not in obese Zucker rats deficient in functional leptin receptors. In conclusion, mature adipocytes release hydrosoluble protein growth factor(s) with a molecular mass &gt;100 kDa for SMCs. Perivascular adipose tissue stimulates SMC proliferation, which is enhanced in aged WKY and in high-fat, diet-induced obesity but not in leptin receptor-deficient obese Zucker rats. These adipocyte-derived growth factor(s) and the effect of perivascular adipose tissue may be involved in vascular disease associated with aging and obesity.</p>

<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) is innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. A role for WAT sympathetic noradrenergic nerves in lipid mobilization has been suggested. To gain insight into the involvement of nerve activity in the delipidation process, WAT nerves were investigated in rat retroperitoneal and epididymal depots after prolonged fasting. A significant increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) content was found in epididymal and, especially, retroperitoneal WAT by Western blotting. Accordingly, an increased immunoreactivity for TH was detected by immunohistochemistry in epididymal and, especially, retroperitoneal vascular and parenchymal noradrenergic nerves. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing nerves were found around arteries and in the parenchyma. Double-staining experiments and confocal microscopy showed that most perivascular and some parenchymal noradrenergic nerves also contained NPY. Detection of protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, a general marker of peripheral nerves, by Western blotting and PGP 9.5-TH by double-staining experiments showed significantly increased noradrenergic nerve density in fasted retroperitoneal, but not epididymal depots, suggesting that formation of new nerves takes place in retroperitoneal WAT in fasting conditions. On the whole, these data confirm the important role of sympathetic noradrenergic nerves in WAT lipid mobilization during fasting but also raise questions about the physiological role of regional-dependent nerve adjustments and their functional significance in relation to white adipocyte secretory products.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue expresses cytokines that inhibit insulin signalling pathways in liver and muscle. Obesity also results in impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in response to insulin. We propose a vasoregulatory role for local deposits of fat around the origin of arterioles supplying skeletal muscle. Isolated first-order arterioles from rat cremaster muscle are under dual regulation by insulin, which activates both endothelin-1 mediated vasoconstriction and nitric-oxide-mediated vasodilatation. In obese rat arterioles, insulin-stimulated NO synthesis is impaired, resulting in unopposed vasoconstriction. We propose that this vasoconstriction is the consequence of production of the adipocytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha from the cuff of fat seen surrounding the origin of the arteriole in obese rats–a depot to which we ascribe a specialist vasoregulatory role. We suggest that this cytokine accesses the nutritive vascular tree to inhibit insulin-mediated capillary recruitment–a mechanism we term “vasocrine” signalling. We also suggest a homology between this vasoactive periarteriolar fat and both periarterial and visceral fat, which may explain relations between visceral fat, insulin resistance, and vascular disease.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: Recent epidemiological studies have shown that there is an increased risk of obesity and hypertension in children born to women who smoked during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of fetal and neonatal exposure to nicotine, the major addictive component of cigarette smoke, on postnatal adiposity and blood vessel function.RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Female Wistar rats were given nicotine or saline (vehicle) during pregnancy and lactation. Postnatal growth was determined in the male offspring from weaning until 26 weeks of age. At 26 weeks of age, fat pad weight and the function of the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) in the thoracic aorta and mesenteric arteries were examined.RESULTS: Exposure to nicotine resulted in increased postnatal body weight and fat pad weight and an increased amount of PVAT in the offspring. Contraction of the aorta induced by phenylephrine was significantly attenuated in the presence of PVAT, whereas this effect was not observed in the aortic rings from the offspring of nicotine-exposed dams. Phenylephrine-induced contraction without PVAT was not different between saline- and nicotine-exposed rats. Transfer of solution incubated with PVAT-intact aorta to PVAT-free aorta induced a marked relaxation response in the rats from saline-exposed dams, but this relaxation response was significantly impaired in the rats from nicotine-exposed dams.DISCUSSION: Our results showed that prenatal nicotine exposure increased adiposity and caused an alteration in the modulatory function of PVAT on vascular relaxation response, thus providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of obesity and hypertension in children exposed to cigarette smoke in utero.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: An increasing number of continuous flow pumps are currently under clinical studies, however very little data exist on the hemodynamic and cellular responses of the failing heart to continuous flow support. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the response of the failing myocardium to continuous flow support.METHODS: We compared echocardiographic and cellular markers of failing myocardium at the time of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and explantation in 20 consecutive patients (12 pulsatile flow [Novacor] and 8 continuous flow [DeBakey-Noon]).RESULTS: The use of mechanical support with both continuous- or pulsatile-type LVADs resulted in a reduction of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV) and left atrial volume (LAV), as well as a decrease in mitral E/A ratio, tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) and pulmonary valve acceleration time (PVAT). Comparative analyses for patients treated with a continuous- vs pulsatile-type LVAD support showed a greater degree of unloading with the latter type, as shown by the effect on LVEDD (-13.7% vs -33.7%, p = 0.0.004), EDV (-23.5% vs -41.2%, p = 0.015), ESV (-25.6% vs -57.6%, p = 0.001) and LAV (-25.2% vs -40.4%, p = 0.071). The hemodynamic effects of continuous vs pulsatile LVAD support were similar, as shown by their effect on mitral E/A ratio (-23.9% vs -39.9%, p = NS), TRV (-26.4% vs -23.8%, p = NS) and PVAT (28.5% vs 38.5%, p = NS). Only pulsatile support demonstrated a statistically significant percent change in mass (-6.3% vs -20.6%, p = 0.038). Continuous and pulsatile forms of mechanical support demonstrated equivalent reductions in myocardial tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), total collagen and mycocyte size.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that, although there are differences between these 2 devices in magnitude of unloading, both forms of support effectively normalize cellular markers of the failing phenotype.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign mesenchymal tumor of the kidney. It belongs to the family of perivascular epithelioid cell tumors and is typically composed of blood vessels, adipose tissue, and smooth muscle- like cells, which are characteristically positive for HMB-45. Results of recent studies suggest that p53 mutation may play an important role in AML progression. Here, we describe a locally destructive renal AML in a patient with tuberous sclerosis. The tumor consisted of mostly epithelioid cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism and frequent mitoses and was positive for HMB-45. The diagnosis of atypical epithelioid AML was made. Codon alteration in the p53 gene was not detected, despite focal p53 immunoreactivity and single nucleotide polymorphism at exon 6. Our finding indicates no definite link between p53 abnormalities and the atypical appearance of AML. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second renal AML case investigated for p53 mutations.</p>

<p>A 28-year-old man presented with a clinical picture suggestive of complex regional pain syndrome type I following a blow to the thenar eminence and thumb. Symptoms, including swelling of the hand and distal forearm, progressed until an amputation was carried out to rid the patient of an unendurable painful and nonfunctioning wrist and hand. The histologic evaluation of the amputation specimen showed: 1) dermal edema, perivascular dermatitis, and epidermal hyperkeratosis; 2) subcutaneous chronic inflammation with subtotal replacement of the adipose lobules by fibrous tissue associated with thickening of the muscular fascia, implying the fasciitis-panniculitis reaction pattern; 3) atrophy, degeneration, necrosis, and focal calcifications of the skeletal muscles; 4) phlebosclerosis, phlebectasias and lymphocytic arteritis; and 5) increased cortical porosity of the bones. It seems that the pathogenetic process underlying the fasciitis-panniculitis syndrome may rarely manifest as a complex regional pain syndrome-like disorder.</p>

<p>A 23-year-old female polar bear (Ursus maritimus) killed in an Inuit hunt in East Greenland on July 9, 1999 had a significantly enlarged clitoris resembling, in size, form and colour, those of previously reported ‘pseudohermaphroditic’ polar bears from Svalbard. It has been suggested that an enzyme defect (21-hydroxylase deficiency), androgen producing tumour or high exposure to organochlorines during the foetal stage or early development could be the reason for the supposed pseudohermaphroditism observed for Svalbard bears. Except for the enlarged clitoris, all dimensions of the external and internal reproductive organs of the present were similar to a reference group of 23 normal adult female polar bears from East Greenland collected in 1999-2002. The aberrant bear was a female genotype, and macroscopic examination of her internal reproductive organs indicated that she was reproductively functional. A histological examination of the clitoral enlargement in the present East Greenland specimen allows a first-time histological evaluation of the earlier macroscopic field diagnosis from Svalbard. This examination revealed intense chronic ulcerative and perivascular clitoriditis similar to “acral lick dermatitis” frequently seen in domestic dogs (i.e., we did not find any signs of pseudohermaphroditic hyperplasia of clitoral tissue due to androgenic or antiestrogenic endocrine disruption). The levels of organohalogens and TEQ values were lower than concentration thresholds of toxicological risk. It is hence possible that the previously reported adult female polar bear pseudohermaphrodites from Svalbard are in fact misdiagnoses. Therefore, future studies examining pseudohermaphroditism in wildlife should consider that certain occurrences are natural events, e.g., enlarged clitoris in the present East Greenland polar bear. Furthermore, caution should be exercised in suggesting linkages of such inflammatory abnormalities with correlations to anthropogenic pollutant exposures.</p>

<p>In humans and most animal models, the development of obesity leads not only to increased fat depots in classical adipose tissue locations but also to significant lipid deposits within and around other tissues and organs, a phenomenon known as ectopic fat storage. The purpose of this review is to explore the possible locations of ectopic fat in key target-organs of cardiovascular control (heart, blood vessels and kidneys) and to propose how ectopic fat storage can play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases associated with obesity. In animals fed a high-fat diet, cardiac fat depots within and around the heart impair both systolic and diastolic functions, and may in the long-term promote heart failure. Accumulation of fat around blood vessels (perivascular fat) may affect vascular function in a paracrine manner, as perivascular fat cells secrete vascular relaxing factors, proatherogenic cytokines and smooth muscle cell growth factors. Furthermore, high amounts of perivascular fat could mechanically contribute to the increased vascular stiffness seen in obesity. Finally, accumulation of fat in the renal sinus may limit the outflow of blood and lymph from the kidney, which would alter intrarenal physical forces and promote sodium reabsorption and arterial hypertension. Taken together, ectopic fat storage in key target-organs of cardiovascular control may impair their functions, contributing to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in obese subjects.</p>

<p>Periadventitial adipose tissue produces vasoactive substances that influence vascular contraction. Earlier studies addressed this issue in aorta, a vessel that does not contribute to peripheral vascular resistance. We tested the hypothesis that periadventitial adipose tissue modulates contraction of smaller arteries more relevant to blood pressure regulation. We studied mesenteric artery rings surrounded by periadventitial adipose tissue from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The contractile response to serotonin, phenylephrine, and endothelin I was markedly reduced in intact vessels compared with vessels without periadventitial fat. The contractile response to U46619 or depolarizing high K+-containing solutions (60 mmol/L) was similar in vessels with and without periadventitial fat. The K+ channel opener cromakalim induced relaxation of vessels precontracted by serotonin but not by U46619 or high K+-containing solutions (60 mmol/L), suggesting that K+ channels are involved. The intracellular membrane potential of smooth muscle cells was more hyperpolarized in intact vessels than in vessels without periadventitial fat. Both the anticontractile effect and membrane hyperpolarization of periadventitial fat were abolished by inhibition of delayed-rectifier K+ (K(v)) channels with 4-aminopyridine (2 mmol/L) or 3,4-diaminopyridine (1 mmol/L). Blocking other K+ channels with glibenclamide (3 micromol/L), apamin (1 micromol/L), iberiotoxin (100 nmol/L), tetraethylammonium ions (1 mmol/L), tetrapentylammonium ions (10 micromol/L), or Ba2+ (3 micromol/L) had no effect. Longitudinal removal of half the perivascular tissue reduced the anticontractile effect of fat by almost 50%, whereas removal of the endothelium had no effect. We suggest that visceral periadventitial adipose tissue controls mesenteric arterial tone by inducing vasorelaxation via K(v) channel activation in vascular smooth muscle cells.</p>

<p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is richly provided with sympathetic noradrenergic nerves but is believed to lack a parasympathetic nerve supply. Acetylcholine is the predominant transmitter of postganglionic parasympathetic nerves. The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) resides in synaptic vesicles of cholinergic nerve terminals and is used as a marker for peripheral cholinergic nerves. We sought cholinergic nerves in rat BAT using VAChT immunohistochemistry (IHC) on cryosections of interscapular, cervical, mediastinal, and perirenal depots. Mediastinal BAT was the sole depot provided with putative parasympathetic perivascular and parenchymal cholinergic nerves. The absence of vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive nerves suggested their nature as pure cholinergic fibers. By confocal microscopy, both cholinergic and noradrenergic nerves were detected in mediastinal BAT. Cold exposure and fasting led to increased density of VAChT-positive fibers and of noradrenergic sympathetic nerves at morphometry. The unexpected double innervation of mediastinal BAT may explain the inhibitory influence on thermogenesis observed after systemic injection of muscarinic antagonists in rats, and raises questions about the physiological role of its cholinergic nerve supply.</p>

<p>A direct card agglutination test for Trypanosoma evansi, CATT/T. evansi based on the predominant variable antigen-type (pVAT) RoTat 1.2 was evaluated previously in the field in Isiolo District, Kenya. Sixteen out of 51 (31.4%) parasitologically positive camels were negative by the antibody detection test. In the present study, trypanosomes isolated from the camels were analysed in an attempt to determine the cause of the false negative results of CATT/T. evansi. A total of 20 field isolates comprised 16 stocks from camels that were negative by CATT/T. evansi, and 4 from CATT/T. evansi-positive camels. In addition, 15 known T. evansi and four T. brucei were used as reference. Purified DNA samples were tested using an established RoTat 1.2-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that yields a 488 bp product for the specific detection of T. evansi. Antibodies to RoTat 1.2 variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) were used in Western blotting to detect RoTat 1.2 VSG linear epitopes. Results of PCR and Western blot showed that the 16 stocks isolated from CATT/T. evansi-negative camels fell into three groups. In Group 1, both the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene and the VSG were absent in three stocks. In five trypanosome stocks in Group 2, the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene was detected, but Western blot was negative indicating absence of the expressed VSG. Five other stocks containing the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene were also in this group. The RoTat 1.2 VSG gene was detected and Western blot was positive in all four trypanosome stocks in Group 3. All four stocks from CATT/T. evansi-positive camels contained the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene and the expressed VSG. The reference T. evansi KETRI 2479 lacked the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene and there was no immune reactivity detected by Western blot. The rest of the reference T. evansi stocks examined contained the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene. All the four T. brucei samples examined were negative by PCR and Western blot. In conclusion, this study showed that the RoTat 1.2 VSG gene was absent from some T. evansi trypanosomes in Kenya.</p>

<p>Semaphorins are cell surface and/or soluble signals that exert an inhibitory control on axon guidance. Sema3A, the vertebrate-secreted semaphorin, binds to neuropilin-1, which together with plexins constitutes the functional receptor. To verify whether Sema3A is produced by white adipocytes and, in that case, to detect its targets in white adipose tissue, we studied the cell production and tissue distribution of Sema3A and neuropilin-1 in rat retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose depots. Sema3A and neuropilin-1 were detected in these depots by Western blotting. The immunohistochemical results showed that Sema3A is produced in, and possibly secreted by, smooth muscle cells of arteries and white adipocytes. Accordingly, neuropilin-1 was found on perivascular and parenchymal nerves. Such a pattern of distribution is in line with a role for secreted Sema3A in the growth and plasticity of white adipose tissue nerves. Indeed, after fasting, when white adipocytes are believed to be overstimulated by noradrenaline and rearrangement of the parenchymal nerve supply may occur, adipocytic expression of Sema3A is reduced. Finally, the presence of neuropilin-1 in some white adipocytes raises the interesting possibility that Sema3A also exerts an autocrine-paracrine role on these cells.</p>

<p>Blood vessels are surrounded by variable amounts of adipose tissue. We showed earlier that adventitial adipose tissue inhibits rat aortic contraction by release of a transferable factor, adventitium-derived relaxing factor (ADRF), which activates smooth muscle K(+) channels. However, little is known about the mechanisms of ADRF release. Using isolated rat aortic rings and isometric contraction measurements, we show that ADRF release depends on extracellular [Ca(2+)] (EC(50) approximately 4.7 mM). ADRF effects do not involve neuronal presynaptic N-type Ca(2+) and Na(+) channels or vanilloid, cannabinoid, and CGRP receptors. ADRF release is strongly inhibited by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin A25. In contrast, daidzein, an inactive genistein analog, and the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor ST638 had no effect. Protein kinase A inhibition by H89 also inhibited ADRF release, whereas the protein kinase G inhibitor KT-5823 had no effect. We propose that ADRF release is Ca(2+) dependent and is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways involving tyrosine kinase and protein kinase A. Furthermore, ADRF release does not depend on perivascular nerve endings.</p>

<p>AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The melanosome-associated proteins, also called HMB45 and melan-A, are also present in renal angiomyolipoma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of HMB45 and melan-A in mesenchymal cells of renal angiomyolipoma and to investigate their significance in the differential diagnosis.METHODS: Twelve patients, 9 females and 3 males diagnosed with renal angiomyolipomas, were included in the present study. The most representative tumor tissue block was chosen from each case, and 5-microm sections were taken to poly-L-lysin-coated slides for immunohistochemical staining. The standard streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method was used for immunostaining with HMB45 and melan-A antibodies.RESULTS: All of the cases showed positive cytoplasmic immunostaining for HMB45 and melan-A. Melan-A expression was shown in smooth muscle component, adipose tissue and predominantly in the perivascular cells, whereas HMB45 immunoreactivity was stronger than melan-A expression in all cases.CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that HMB45 and melan-A reactivity is a useful tool to distinguish renal angiomyolipomas from other primary and secondary mesenchymal and primary epithelial tumors. Melan-A and HMB45 share similar specificities for renal angiomyolipoma. In addition, such expression in renal angiomyolipomas may occur without any evidence of nevomelanocytic differentiation. Further research is required to determine the histogenesis of this entity.</p>

<p>Overfeeding of rodents leads to increased local formation of angiotensin II due to increased secretion of angiotensinogen from adipocytes. Whereas angiotensin II promotes adipocyte growth and preadipocyte recruitment, increased secretion of angiotensinogen from adipocytes also directly contributes to the close relationship between adipose-tissue mass and blood pressure in mice. In contrast, angiotensin II acts as an antiadipogenic substance in human adipose tissue, and the total increase in adipose-tissue mass may be more important in determining human plasma angiotensinogen levels than changes within the single adipocyte. However, as increased local formation of angiotensin II in adipose tissue may be increased especially in obese hypertensive subjects, a contribution of the adipose-tissue renin-angiotensin system to the development of insulin resistance and hypertension is conceivable in humans, but not yet proven. Insulin resistance may be aggravated by the inhibition of preadipocyte recruitment, which results in the redistribution of triglycerides to the liver and skeletal muscle, and blood pressure may be influenced by local formation of angiotensin II in perivascular adipose tissue. Thus, although the mechanisms are still speculative, the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibition and angiotensin-receptor blockade on the development of type 2 diabetes in large clinical trials suggest a pathophysiological role of the adipose-tissue renin-angiotensin system in the metabolic syndrome.</p>

<h4>Regarding six cases of mesenteric panniculitis: US, spiral CT, Magnetic Resonance.</h4>

<p>PURPOSE: Mesenteric panniculitis is a rare inflammatory disease. The inflammation produces a lesion which appears as a mass, and normally produces abdominal pain without any other significant clinical signs. The radiological pattern is not typical, but the diagnosis is aided by a number of elements which are important to recognise in order to avoid invasive diagnostic methods or therapy. Six cases are presented, all evaluated with sonography, Color-Doppler US, Spiral CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated six patients with negative clinical histories and endoscopic examinations. The patients reported the recent onset of indefinite symptoms and abdominal pain treated at home. Abdominal plain film radiography, performed also in the upright position, was negative in all cases. All the patients underwent abdominal sonography and Colour-Doppler ultrasound. Spiral CT scanning was carried out with 5-mm slice thickness, a pitch of 1.3, and single breath-hold volumetric acquisitions starting 60 s after intravenous injection of iodinated contrast medium. Only in one case, where Crohn’s disease was suspected and subsequently not confirmed, did we perform small bowel enema with transparent contrast medium to distend the bowel loops. MR imaging was performed using a medium-field 0.5 T magnet, T1-weighted Fast SE, T2-weighted Fast SE and Fast STIR sequences. We considered: the mass effect of the lesion; the presence of vascular infiltration; the presence of a peripheral pseudocapsule; the presence of perivascular loose tissue proper, having densitometric characteristics distinctive from the remaining fatty tissue of the diseased mesentery.RESULTS: In all cases ultrasound detected only an central abdominal mass. The fatty content of the mass, however, reduced US transmission, preventing the acquisition of more complete information. The color-Doppler US also produced little data, except some isolated colour spots within the mass. In no case did CT directly detect a peripheral pseudocapsule, although it did identify a difference in density between the perivisceral abdominal loose tissue and the mesentery proper, which is hyperdense. The vessels inside the mesentery on no occasion appeared infiltrated. The CT scans were unable to identify differential elements between the perivascular loose tissue and the fatty tissue of the main mass. MRI, on the other hand, enabled the detection of the peripheral pseudocapsule which surrounded the mesenteric mass as a band of tissue with low signal intensity in all the sequences performed. In fast STIR sequences suppression of the fat signal of the mesenteric mass was insufficient, being suppressed only in the adipose tissue surrounding the arterial branches of the mesenteric artery. Four of the six patients underwent exploratory laparotomy. The histological examination of the biopsies revealed a massive inflammatory infiltration of the mesentery, with relatively little involvement of the perivascular adipose tissue.CONCLUSIONS: In mesenteric panniculitis, sonography and spiral-CT are useful in focusing diagnostic attention on the mesentery, but only MRI is capable of providing the information necessary formulating a complete diagnosis of the disease.</p>

<p>Virtually all blood vessels are surrounded by adventitial fat. Adipocytes produce a host of vasoactive substances that may influence vascular contraction. We tested whether or not perivascular adipose tissue modulates contraction of aortic ring preparations. We studied aortic rings surrounded by periadventitial adipose tissue from adult Sprague-Dawley rats. At a maximum concentration of 300 nM angiotensin II, 6.5 microM serotonin, and 5 microM phenylephrine, the contractile response of intact rings was 95%, 80%, and 30% lower than that of vessels without periadventitial fat. The anticontractile effect of periadventitial fat was reduced by inhibition of ATP-dependent K+ channels with glibenclamide (3 microM) and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 microM). Blocking NOS, cyclo-oxygenase, cytochrome P450, or adenosine receptors did not restore the vascular response in intact vessels. The anticontractile effect of perivascular fat was present in Zucker fa/fa rats, suggesting that leptin receptors were not responsible. Transferring the bath solution from intact vessels, isolated periadventitial tissue, and cultured rat adipocytes to precontracted vessels lacking periadventitial fat resulted in a rapid relaxation. We suggest that perivascular adventitial adipose tissue releases a transferable adventitium-derived relaxing factor that acts by tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells.</p>

<p>A case is reported of a 56-year-old male who presented with bilateral pleural effusion as an initial manifestation of idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis. The patient showed shortness of breath with severe loss of vital capacity and weight loss. A mediastinal mass surrounding the thoracic aorta and bilateral pleuritis was identified by the chest CT scan. The mass extended, along the abdominal aorta, to the upper portion of retroperitoneum. Laboratory data showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR), and IgG. Biopsy of the mediastinal and the pleural mass showed adipose tissue and fibrosis with mild perivascular inflammatory infiltration. A diagnosis of idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis was made, and 40 mg/day of prednisolone was administered. Although CRP and ESR was normalized, the mass size and vital capacity were almost unchanged.</p>

<p>ADAM 12 (meltrin-alpha) is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family. ADAM 12 functions as an active metalloprotease, supports cell adhesion, and has been implicated in myoblast differentiation and fusion. Human ADAM 12 exists in two forms: the prototype membrane-anchored protein, ADAM 12-L, and a shorter secreted form, ADAM 12-S. Here we report the occurrence of adipocytes in the skeletal muscle of transgenic mice in which overexpression of either form is driven by the muscle creatine kinase promoter. Cells expressing a marker of early adipogenesis were apparent in the perivascular space in muscle tissue of 1- to 2-week-old transgenic mice whereas mature lipid-laden adipocytes were seen at 3 to 4 weeks. Moreover, female transgenics expressing ADAM 12-S exhibited increases in body weight, total body fat mass, abdominal fat mass, and herniation, but were normoglycemic and did not exhibit increased serum insulin, cholesterol, or triglycerides. Male transgenics were slightly overweight and also developed herniation but did not become obese. Transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of ADAM 12-S lacking the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain did not develop this adipogenic phenotype, suggesting a requirement for ADAM 12 protease activity. This is the first in vivo demonstration that an ADAM protease is involved in adipogenesis.</p>

<p>These studies suggest that the adventitia may play a role in vascular lesion formation after balloon overstretch injury of pig coronary arteries by contributing to the cellular mass of the neointima and the synthesis of growth factors. In addition, the adventitia may contribute to vascular remodeling and constriction of the external elastic lamina through accumulation of myofibroblasts containing alpha smooth muscle actin in the adventitia surrounding the injury site. Inhibition of myofibroblast proliferation and/or recruitment by intravascular brachytherapy positively affects vascular remodeling through its action on adventitial cells. Inflammation is a major event associated with balloon angioplasty, resulting in the sequential recruitment of neutrophils (2-24 hours) and monocyte/macrophages (24-72 hours) predominantly into the adventitia surrounding the injury site. It is hypothesized that inflammatory cells release cytokines and/or increase the production of superoxides which stimulate the proliferation and recruitment of adventitial myofibroblasts. Inflammatory and proliferative responses were not confined to the local adventitia but were found extending as far as 1-3 mm away from the injured vessel in the distal perivascular tissues. Studies were performed to examine the expression of genes associated with cell migration at early times after injury in an attempt to determine the source of the adventitial myofibroblasts. Expression of genes involved in cell migration including MMP-2, MMP-9, and tenascin was found as early as 2 hours following angioplasty in the intramyocardial, pericardial, and adipose tissue fibroblasts. While these studies suggest that local tissue was the source of the myofibroblasts recruited to the injury site, we have been unable to confirm this finding by direct fluorescent labeling of adventitial cells. Recent work from our laboratory suggests that myofibroblast precursors may be isolated from buffy coat preparations from peripheral blood. These results lead us to hypothesize that stem cells that differentiate into myofibroblasts may be recruited in early inflammatory infiltrates in the adventitia. Clearly, additional work will have to be directed at a more detailed examination of the response of adventitial and other perivascular cells and tissues to balloon injury to determine their sources and their role in regulating vascular lesion development.</p>

<p>Lymph node status has great clinical importance in the management of patients with colorectal cancer. Several pathologic factors may affect the accuracy of nodal status assessment in this tumor type. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in a series of 166 stage II and stage III colorectal adenocarcinomas, the following pathologic parameters: number of lymph nodes recovered and examined, number of lymph nodes with metastases, and number of tumor nodules (TNs) in the perirectal or pericolic adipose tissue greater or smaller than 3 mm in diameter (TNs &gt; 3 mm and TNs &lt; 3 mm, respectively). The prognostic significance of these parameters, as well as of other histopathologic variables, was determined using univariate and multivariate survival analyses. Our results indicate that the examination of a small number of regional lymph nodes may result in understaging of tumors classified as pN0 (stage II). In addition, our data suggest that TNs &gt; 3 mm and TNs &lt; 3 mm represent distinct pathologic entities. TNs &gt; 3 mm should be considered the prognostic equivalent of lymph node metastases as recommended by the 1997 TNM classification. In contrast, TNs &lt; 3 mm probably originate by intravascular or perivascular tumor extension. Their presence is associated with adverse clinical outcome in stage III patients, regardless of the number of lymph node metastases.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: Inflammation has been suggested to play a role in vascular lesion formation after angioplasty. Whereas previous studies have focused on inflammatory reactions in the intima and media, less attention has been paid to adventitial and perivascular responses and their potential role in vascular remodeling.METHODS AND RESULTS: Balloon overstretch injury of porcine coronary arteries was performed with standard clinical angioplasty catheters. Vessels were examined from 0.5 hour to 14 days after injury by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH) for neutrophil and macrophage markers, cell adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and neutrophil-specific CXC chemokines (alveolar macrophage-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor [AMCF]-I/interleukin-8 and AMCF-II). Neutrophils accumulated in the adventitia surrounding the injury site from 2 hours to 3 days, followed by macrophages from 1 to 7 days after angioplasty. Inflammation was associated temporally with the expression of mRNAs encoding cell adhesion molecules and chemokines. The main inflammatory and proliferative foci were not limited to the adventitia but rather extended many millimeters away from the injured vessel throughout the surrounding adipose and myocardial tissues.CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory responses after angioplasty of porcine coronary arteries occurred throughout the entire perivascular tissue. We hypothesize that perivascular inflammatory cells play a role in the recruitment and/or proliferation of adventitial myofibroblasts, possibly through the release of reactive oxygen species and/or cytokines, and thus contribute to vascular remodeling associated with postangioplasty restenosis.</p>

<p>Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors of the kidney derived from putative perivascular epithelioid cells, that may undergo differentiation into cells with features of melanocytes, smooth muscle, and fat. To gain further insight into angiomyolipomas, we have generated the first human angiomyolipoma cell line by sequential introduction of SV40 large T antigen and human telomerase into human angiomyolipoma cells. These cells show phenotypic characteristics of angiomyolipomas, namely differentiation markers of smooth muscle (smooth muscle actin), adipose tissue (peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma, PPARgamma), and melanocytes (microophthalmia, MITF), thus demonstrating that a single cell type can exhibit all of these phenotypes. These cells should serve as a valuable tool to elucidate signal transduction pathways underlying renal angiomyolipomas.</p>

<p>The clinicopathological features of Nasu-Hakola disease are described by reviewing previously reported cases and adding consideration to newly disclosed evidence. This disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by membranocystic lipodystrophy in the skeletal system and sclerosing leukoencephalopathy in the nervous system. The leukoencephalopathic alterations are demyelinization of the cerebral white matter, associated with conspicuous fibrillary gliosis and preservation of the subcortical arcuate fibers. Sudanophilic granules are focally scattered in the perivascular space or widely infiltrated in the affected white matter, and some neuronal loss with deposits of calcospherites is encountered in the basal ganglia and also in the thalamus. Spheroid formation with an increased number of neurofilaments in the neuronal axon is considered a possible pathogenesis, and a primary vascular mechanism is also suggested. Interestingly, most of the reported cases of Nasu-Hakola disease are from Japan and Finland which suggests heredofamilial background as a cause.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: A pericolonic tumor deposit (PTD) is a grossly palpated adenocarcinomas within pericolonic adipose tissue not within a lymph node. The source and prognostic significance of PTDs has not been well defined.METHODS: The authors studied 418 T3N+M0 colon adenocarcinomas to determine the frequency and significance of PTDs. They also step-sectioned 30 PTDs to determine their origin and assist in their optimum TNM classification.RESULTS: Seventy-one (18%) of 400 consecutively examined cases had PTDs. The actuarial 1-, 2-, and 5-year disease free survival rates were significantly lower among patients with a PTD. PTDs, regardless of size, significantly impacted disease free survival. Increasing numbers of PTDs was associated with shorter disease free survival. Adenocarcinoma grade, a PTD, increasing numbers of PTDs, and number of lymph node metastases were independently associated with shorter disease free survival. The likelihood of extrahepatic abdominal failure was proportionally greater with increasing numbers of PTDs. Adenocarcinoma was observed in perineural, peri-large vessel, or intravascular locations in step-sectioned PTDs.CONCLUSIONS: A PTD is a perineural, perivascular, or intravascular tumor extension beyond the muscularis propria. They are distinct from lymph node metastases and should not be considered their prognostic equivalent. The disease free survival impact of even small PTDs was significant, suggesting that PTDs of all sizes should be considered a single entity. TNM classification of PTDs as lymph node metastases or discontinuous tumor extension is probably not accurate. The number and greatest dimension of PTDs should be reported separately from lymph node metastases.</p>

<p>Interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT), a site of nonshivering thermogenesis in mammals, is neurally controlled. The co-existence of sympathetic and peptidergic innervation has been demonstrated in different brown adipose depots. We studied the morphological profile of IBAT innervation and tested by immunohistochemical methods whether cold and warm stimulation are accompanied by modifications in the density of parenchymal noradrenergic nerve fibers. We also studied the immunoreactivity of afferent fibers–which contain calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP)–in different functional conditions. IBAT was obtained from adult rats (6 weeks old) acclimated at different temperatures (4 degrees, 20 degrees, and 28 degrees C). Tissue activity was evaluated by studying the immunolocalization of uncoupling protein (UCP-1), a specific marker of brown adipose tissue. Noradrenergic and peptidergic innervation were seen to arise from morphologically different nerves. Fibers staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were thin, unmyelinated hilar nerves, and CGRP- and SP-positive fibers were in thick nerves containing both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. Under cold stimulation, noradrenergic neurons produce greater amounts of TH, and their axons branch, resulting in increased parenchymal nerve fibers density. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) probably co-localizes with TH in noradrenergic neurons, but only in the perivascular nerve fiber network. The parenchymal distribution of NPY to interlobular arterioles and capillaries suggests that this peptide must have other functions besides that of innervating arteriovenous anastomoses, as hypothesized by other researchers. The different distribution of CGRP and SP suggests the existence of different sensory neuronal populations. The detection of CGRP at the parenchymal level is in line with the hypothesis of a trophic action of this peptide.</p>

<p>Lipoma is one of the most common benign mesenchymal tumors. Its ability to trigger an angiogenic response is a critical step for its growth. Because adipose tissue serves as an important conduit for the vasculature, it is conceivable that the angiogenic properties of this tissue may modulate the growth of the vasculature in a paracrine manner. We investigated in vivo the angiogenic potential of bioptic fragments of human lipoma by using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), a useful model for such an investigation. The angiogenic response in pathological and control implants was assessed on histologic sections by a morphometric method, 96 h after grafting. Results showed that pathological samples were surrounded by numerous allantoic vessels with a radially arranged pattern around the implant. The vascular counts in the CAMs treated with lipoma implants were comparable to that of FGF-2. The role played in vasoproliferative response by angiogenic cytokines (FGF-2, VEGF) released by adipocytes, by endogenous cytokines, such as FGF-2, stored in the CAM extracellular matrix and by angiogenic growth factors released by perivascular mononuclear cells around the newly-formed blood vessels, were supported by this study.</p>

<p>Marrow stroma was investigated in 20 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Such morphological and functional features as adipose tissue reduction, sinusoid pattern obliteration and increased number of reticular cells were identified as typical of marrow stroma in such patients. Foci of fibrosis, nuclear bodies in stromal cell nuclei and heightened proliferation of stromal precursors in organ cultures were recorded in the subendostal and perivascular areas in 60% of patients with diffuse lesions of bone marrow. Bone marrow stroma was shown to suffer morphological and functional changes which were particularly pronounced in diffuse lesions of the bone marrow. Such changes may be traced both to the malignant clone of lymphoid cells and stromal lesions.</p>

<p>Adipose tissue equivalents have not been addressed as yet despite the clinical need in congenital deformities, posttraumatic repair, cancer rehabilitation, and other soft tissue defects. Preadipocytes were successfully harvested from rat epididymal fat pads of Sprague-Dawley and Lewis rats and expanded ex vivo. In vitro cultures demonstrated full differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes with normal lipogenic activity. The onset of differentiation was well-controlled by regulating preadipocyte confluency. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) polymer disks with 90% porosity, 2.5 mm thick, 12 mm diameter, pore size range of 135-633 microm were fabricated and seeded with preadipocytes at 10(5) cells/mL. Disks in vitro demonstrated fully differentiated mature adipocytes within the pores of the disks. Short-term in vivo experiments were conducted by implanting preseeded disks subcutaneously on the flanks of rats for 2 and 5 weeks. Histologic staining of harvested disks with osmium tetroxide (OsO4) revealed the formation of adipose tissue throughout the disks. Fluorescence labeling of preadipocytes confirmed that formed adipose tissue originated from seeded preadipocytes rather than from possible infiltrating perivascular tissue. This study demonstrates the potential of using primary preadipocytes as a cell source in cell-seeded polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to fully characterize and emphasize the salient features of an unusual variant of angiomyolipoma that the authors believe has been underrecognized.METHODS: Five cases of atypical angiomyolipoma (AAML) of the kidney, two of which were reported previously, were retrieved from the consultation files of one of the authors. In one patient a small extrarenal tumor was examined in addition to the primary renal tumor. The histopathologic features of all six tumors, the immunohistochemical findings of five tumors (including the extrarenal tumor), and the ultrastructure of three tumors were analyzed. Clinical follow-up was obtained for all patients.RESULTS: Two tumors occurred in children and presented as large masses (&gt; or = 15 cm), and 2 tumors were small (&lt; 5 cm) and affected middle-aged adults; the remaining tumor, of intermediate size (6 cm), occurred in an adolescent. One child with tuberous sclerosis also had a small (2 cm) extrarenal lesion. All tumors were circumscribed and had a red-brown cut surface. The largest tumors showed areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumors were highly cellular and composed of various types of multinucleated and mononuclear cells. The most distinguishing of these, and virtually pathognomonic of this entity, were huge cells with abnormal strap-like and ameboid configurations having copious eosinophilic hyaline cytoplasm and myriad nuclei disposed peripherally in a ring-like fashion. Ganglion-like cells, polygonal cells, and spindle cells also were observed. For the most part, all cell types shared the same nuclear features, and except for one tumor, mitoses were negligible. The cells displayed a perivascular arrangement, and grew as loosely organized sheets oriented around abnormally dilated vascular channels or in a hemangiopericytic pattern; glomeruloid vessels were variably present. Notably, adipose tissue was inconspicuous. The tumors stained positive for HMB-45 protein, smooth muscle specific actin, and muscle specific actin antibodies, with a tendency for immunoreactivity to segregate along with individual cell phenotypes. Immunoperoxidase stains also disclosed a prominent and consistent intratumoral histiocytic component and a T-cell lymphoid infiltrate. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells were replete with organelles showing highly electron-dense granules. All patients underwent radical nephrectomy; three patients with significant follow-up remain free of disease.CONCLUSIONS: AAML exhibits unusual but distinctive “pseudomalignant” histomorphologic features that facilitate its recognition, and a singular immunohistochemical profile that allows diagnostic confirmation. It occurs both sporadically and in association with tuberous sclerosis, affects both the adult and pediatric populations, and has shown an indolent behavior. AAML attests to the biologic and morphologic diversity that characterizes tuberous sclerosis hamartomata in general, and to the plasticity of the yet unclarified precursor of angiomyolipoma in particular.</p>

<p>Myositides are characterized by perivascular and intrafascicular inflammatory infiltrates and often by fiber de- and regeneration. In chronic disease, muscle size decreases, and replacement of muscle parenchyma by adipose and fibrous tissue (and, in childhood myositis, calcifications of the muscles and subcutaneous fat) occurs. Muscle imaging techniques such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging facilitate the assessment of the type (edema, inflammation, fat, fibrosis, and calcifications), degree, and localization of these alterations. Both methods allow evaluation of the activity, chronicity, and severity of myositis and assist in directing the biopsy site. However, MR imaging is more sensitive in the detection of muscle edema, which is common in the early stages of inflammatory myopathies. In general, MR tomographic features provide more information regarding the differential diagnosis than do creatine kinase activity and even electromyography. Muscle imaging techniques should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation and to assist in treatment of inflammatory myopathies. This paper reviews the value and limitations of muscle imaging in inflammatory myopathies.</p>

<p>The clinicopathological and immunohistochemical profile of 17 cases of angiomyofibroblastoma (AMF) arising in the genital tract of females is reported. The lesions usually presented as painless masses and were located in the superficial vulvar region (15 cases), canal of Nuck (one case), and perineum (one case) in women ranging in age from 38 to 60 years (median, 46 years). The tumors were well delineated and ranged in size from 2 to 8 cm in greatest dimension. Microscopically, they were composed of spindled and epithelioid mesenchymal cells arranged in cords and nests preferentially arrayed around numerous small to medium-sized vessels. Mitotic activity ranged from 0 to 7 mitoses per 50 high-power fields (HPF) with no abnormal mitotic figures. Minimal nuclear atypia was appreciated. Intralesional fat was present in 12 cases and in two of these cases constituted most of the tumor (lipomatous variant of AMF). Tumor cells expressed vimentin (five of five cases), estrogen receptor protein (six of six cases), progesterone receptor protein (five of six cases), desmin (six of eight cases), CD34 (one of six cases), and smooth muscle actin (one of seven cases). None of the eight women with follow-up of up to 25 years (mean, 7.8 years) after simple excision developed a recurrence. This study confirms the benign nature of AMF, broadens its morphological spectrum to include a lipomatous variant, and proposes an origin from a perivascular stem cell that is capable of myofibroblastic and fatty differentiation.</p>

<p>Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a member of the lipocalin superfamily. The primary structure and diverse expression of ApoD suggest that this protein is a multiligand, multifunctional glycoprotein. Here we report the structure of the mouse ApoD gene, which is composed of six exons spanning approximately 20 kb in length. All the exon-intron splice junctions follow the consensus GT/AG sequence. The 5’-flanking region of the mouse ApoD gene contains several putative regulatory elements, including FSE-2, GRE, SDR, MRE, IL-6RE, and TATA box. Northern blot analysis revealed that ApoD was highly expressed in the brain and adipose tissue in mouse. Lower levels of expression were observed in the heart, lung, thymus, testis, and salivary glands. In situ hybridization for the brain showed that ApoD mRNA was mainly localized in the subarachnoid space including the pia. In the Niemann-Pick disease type C mouse model, ApoD expression was upregulated in many organs such as brain, adipose tissue, heart, and thymus, presumably due to enhanced ApoD synthesis in perivascular fibroblasts.</p>

<p>Evaluation of infiltration of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and artery (SMA) fat planes has been considered in differentiating pancreatic carcinoma from pancreatitis. Some pancreatitis cases, however, can cause perivascular fat plane obliteration due to extension of the inflammatory process, mimicking appearances of carcinoma. This study investigated the diameters of SMV and SMA on CT scans, just caudal to the origin of SMA and portal confluens, in 68 pancreatitis and in 48 pancreatic carcinoma patients. SMA-to-SMV diameters (A/V diameter) were compared and ratios were obtained. In conclusion, it appears that when the A/V ratio is over 1.0, a malignant condition can be suspected. This may be used as a secondary criterion in the differential diagnosis of pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma.</p>

<p>The reproductive fitness of seven isolates of Pratylenchus vulnus from different geographical areas and hosts was assessed in monoxenic cultures (carrot), and greenhouse cultures (plum, sour orange, and quince). The genetic makeup of the different isolates was compared by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR). The apple (PvAP-S) and apricot (PvAT-F) isolates reproduced less in monoxenic cultures than the rose (PvRO-S) and walnut (PvWA-A and PvWA-U) isolates. On plum, the rose isolate (PvRO-S) reproduced better than the apple (PvAP-S) and walnut isolate from the United States (PvWA-U). On sour orange, the apple (PvAP-S), unknown origin (PvU-UK), and walnut isolate from Argentina (PvWA-A) multiplied well, whereas the walnut isolate from the United States (PvWA-U), apricot (PvAT-F), and rose (PvRO-S) did not. On quince, the apple (PvAP-S) and walnut (PvWA-U) isolates showed a higher reproduction than the one from unknown origin (PvU-UK). RAPD-PCR patterns among the seven P. vulnus isolates were similar, although high intraspecific varibility was detected. Very few bands of P. neglectus were shared by any population of P. vulnus. A high degree of similarity was found among the patterns corresponding to the rose (PvRO-S), apple (PvAP-S), walnut from the United States (PvWA-U), and unknown origin (PvUK-U) isolates. The apricot isolate (PvAT-F) was the most dissimilar among the seven isolates. No correlation could be established between the genetic variation of P. vulnus detected by RAPD-PCR and reproductive fitness. Results demonstrate high genetic varibility between geographically separated populations of P. vulnus.</p>

<p>We report a comparative study of 3 clear cell tumors of the lung (CCTL) and 3 angiomyolipomas (AML) of the kidney. Morphological analysis shows that the cells of CCTL are identical to the perivascular epithelioid component of AML. Phenotypically they both consistently expressed melanoma-associated antigens recognized by Moabs HMB45 and HMSA-1, while they were negative for HMSA-5. A minority of cells also expressed S-100 protein, vimentin and actin. In addition, one case of CCTL showed mature adipose tissue entrapped in the proliferation, thus suggesting an intermediate form between CCTL and AML. Based on morphological and phenotypical similarities, it is suggested that CCTL and AML belong to the same family of lesions, characterized by the presence of a peculiar muscle cell, expressing different melanoma-associated antigens.</p>

A para-aortic lymphadenectomy was carried out in 5 groups of 5 New Zealand female rabbits. The perivascular cicatricial tissue was dissected after specific delay for each group (48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks). Peritoneal reconstruction was observed in 80% of the “48 h” group, and in 100% in the other groups (from 1 to 6 weeks). Vascular injury complicated dissection in 40% for the “1 week” group, in 80% for the “2 weeks” group, and in 20% for the “6 weeks” group. No vascular complication was observed in the “48 h” and “4 weeks” groups. The results of “1 week” and “2 weeks” were combined. The results of the “4 weeks” group were compared, with the Fisher test, to the results of a “1 week” and “2 weeks” combined group as well as to the results of the “six weeks” group. Four weeks seem to be the optimal date for a possible surgical excision after a laparoscopic lymphadenectomy.</p>

Plantlets were obtained from micropropagated plant material, and nematode isolates were reared in monoxenic cultures. All isolates suppressed growth on GF-677 compared with the uninfected controls. Isolate PvRO-S from Spain affected top weight of GF-677 more adversely than PvAT-F from France. Final population densities (Pf) of all P. vulnus on GF-677 were greater than 14.7 times the initial densities (Pi). They increased 61.5-fold on plants infected by PvWA-U from the United States. PvWA-U-, PvAT-F, and geographic undetermined PvU-UK isolates did not affect the growth of M-26 apple rootstock compared with PvAP-S, PvRO-S (both from Spain), and PvWA-A from Argentina isolates, which severely suppressed shoot growth of this rootstock. On M-26, Pf of the more parasitically fit isolates PvWA-A, PvAP-S, and PvRO-S were greater than those of nondamaging PvWA-U, PvAT-F, and PvU-UK isolates (&gt;41.4 vs. &lt;14.7 times the Pi). PvWA-U and PvAT-F reproduced more on GF-677 than on M-26 (&gt;28.6 vs. &lt;6.5 times the Pi). Isolate PvRO-S reproduced well and was quite destructive on both rootstocks.

<p>We report 20 cases of a peculiar fatty tumor that occurred in 16 female and four male patients who were 14-70 years old (median, 36 years). Most lesions were situated in the subcutis, superficial muscular fascia, or skeletal muscle of the limbs and limb girdles (15), trunk (3), and the head and neck (2). They were 1.5-11 cm in size (median, 4 cm) and usually described as yellow (13 of 15) and encapsulated (13 of 15). Microscopically they were well circumscribed and consisted of nests, strands, and sheets of eosinophilic and vacuolated cells, which contained glycogen and fat droplets, resembling brown fat cells, lipoblasts and chondroblasts. In all cases there was a variable background of mature adipose tissue associated with a prominent, partially fibrinous to hyalinized myxoid matrix that contained acid mucopolysaccharides usually resistant to hyaluronidase digestion. Several cases had foci of serous atrophy, perivascular fibrosis, and small thrombi; two were focally calcified. The lesions stained for S100 protein (11 of 12), vimentin (10 of 11), and CD68 antigen with KP1 (9 of 11); focal staining for keratin was also seen (4 of 11), but none stained for epithelial membrane antigen or actin or with HMB45. Follow-up in 12 cases (median, 9.5 years) revealed no local recurrences or metastases. Despite its deep location and atypical cellular features, the lesion’s nonaggressive behavior suggests it is benign and neither a myxoid liposarcoma nor a myxoid chondrosarcoma, with which it is most frequently confused. The presence of glycogen in vacuolated fat cells is similar to brown fat, and the presence of sulfated stromal mucins supports focal chondroid differentiation. Although the pathogenesis remains uncertain, a lipoma with hibernomatous features, myxoid change, chondroid metaplasia, and secondary degenerative features is favored over a lipogranulomatous process.</p>

<p>We have studied inflammatory reactions in the mesenteric tissue of mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Perivascular tissue contained diffuse infiltrates of macrophages, eosinophilic granulocytes and lymphocytes. Angiogenesis in the perivascular adipose tissue was associated with superficial plasmacytogenic foci. Polypoid structures were occasionally formed adjacent to inflammatory foci in the adipose tissue, organized around loops of capillaries, with terminal formation of a glomerular capillary network embedded in connective tissue, covered by plasmacytes. We conclude that these structures are specialized milky spots dedicated to active plasmacytogenesis and antibody secretion into the peritoneal cavity of schistosome-infected mice.</p>

<p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is known to be a principal energy source of non-shivering thermogenesis and related diet-induced thermogenesis. These regulate body temperature and body weight and are controlled by the dissipation of excessive dietary caloric intake. We carried out histopathologic, immunohistochemical and biochemical studies of BAT in rats in relation to aging changes. Four groups of Donryu strain male rats (5 each of 1 month, 2 months, 4 months and 20 months of age) were used. They had been given commercial chow and tap water ad libitum and were kept in an air-conditioned room. Body weight (BW), interscapular BAT weight (IBATW) and g IBATW/g BW of rats were measured. Nor-adrenalin (NA), and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) of IBAT were determined. To evaluate the catecholaminergic effects of BAT, morphometric quantitation of BAT was carried out based on the cytoplasmic locularity of fat globules in the BAT cells. Distribution of DBH in BAT was assessed immunohistochemically by the avidin biotin peroxidase complex method. With the use of statistical analysis of variance procedure, there were highly significant decreases in the ratio of g IBATW/g BW (p less than 0.0001) and in the concentrations of NA (p less than 0.0001) and DBH (p less than 0.01) between young (weaning at 1 month old) rats and adult (aged from 4 to 20 months) rats. In the morphometric measurement, by the statistical analysis system (SAS) Spearman correlation coefficient method, there was a significant increase of Type 5 cell (monocular brown adipose tissue cell) in 4 month and 20 month rats, compared to 1 month and 2 month rats (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical study of BAT showed localization of DBH in perivascular mesenchymal cells which corresponded with the morphologic distribution of catecholamine as reported by Lever. The results suggest that in the processes of aging in the rat there are reductions in the ratio of g IBATW/g BW, NA and the activity in DBH.</p>

<p>Virtually every blood vessel in the body is surrounded to some degree by adipose tissue. A potential role for perivascular adipose tissue as a neurohumoral regulator of vascular responsiveness was studied. Thoracic aortae obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats were cut into rings for use in a standard in vitro smooth muscle bath set-up. The vessels were either cleaned of surrounding adipose tissue or left intact. Contractile responses to KCl and phenylephrine as well as relaxation responses to acetylcholine, isoproterenol and sodium nitroprusside were not different between cleaned and intact tissues. However, a significant decrease in the sensitivity to norepinephrine was observed in intact vessels. This altered response was corrected by prior treatment with desipramine plus deoxycorticosterone. Contractile responses of aortic ring preparations to tyramine and a potassium-free physiological solution were significantly greater in intact tissues. Electrical stimulation resulted in no response in cleaned tissues, however, a frequency-dependent contraction was elicited in intact vessels. Phentolamine blocked the contractile responses generated by these manipulations which activate the sympathetic neuroeffector system. Responses evoked by electrical stimulation in intact vascular preparations were significantly attenuated by prior exposure to the selective angiotensin II (AII) antagonist SarI-Ile8-AII. These observations demonstrate that perivascular adipose tissue significantly influences vascular responsiveness in the in vitro setting.</p>

<p>Trichomonas gallinae, Eiberg strain, is a virulent hepatotropic flagellate parasite of pigeons. The parasite initially infects the upper digestive tract, causing the formation of ulcers, which allow it to enter the circulatory system. The trichomonads later gain access to the liver, where they cause the formation of caseous lesions. Vascular congestion and perivascular cuffing in the liver were seen as early as 4 days postinfection (PI). By day 7 PI, a marked reduction in abdominal fat and hepatosplenomegaly was evident. Hepatocytes underwent fatty degeneration (seen by day 7 PI) before total necrosis set in. On day 8 PI, trichomonads could be found among the necrotic hepatocytes in caseous lesions. These lesions were delineated by a wall of leukocytes and occasional giant cells. Nonimmune pigeons died within 14 to 17 days PI of liver dysfunction. Other organs (kidney and genitalia) were also seen to undergo degeneration. These manifestations probably reflect the progression of liver dysfunction.</p>

<p>For a long time, CD13 molecules have been considered to be restricted to myeloid cells and related neoplasms. Meanwhile, however, expression of CD13 has also been detected in some hepatocellular, gallbladder, renal, and lung carcinomas, and even in some fibrosarcomas and malignant melanomas. In this study, expression of CD13 antigen was immunohistochemically examined in non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, along with 33 benign and 83 malignant mesenchymal tumors (MET) using CD13 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) My7, U71, WM-15, and MoU48. In non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, expression of CD13 was restricted to perivascular fibrocytes/blasts, tissue histiocytes, osteoclasts, and to the perineurium of peripheral nerve trunks. Under neoplastic conditions, CD13 was detectable in some tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous, fibrohistiocytic, synovial, osteogenic, and peripheral nerve sheath origin, and even in some tumors of adipose tissue. Tumors of striated muscle origin, of autonomic ganglia, and of cartilage-forming tissues were CD13-negative throughout. Thus in most but not all tumors studied the pattern of expression of CD13 mirrors the situation found in their cells of origin. These findings enrich the data on expression of leukocyte differentiation antigens in extra-hematopoietic tissues. Expression of CD13, which meanwhile is known to be identical to aminopeptidase N, an important peptide-cleaving enzyme, in only some MET might reflect a special functional state of these neoplasms.</p>

<p>The histological lesions were studied in seven rhesus and three cynomolgus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus for periods ranging from nine weeks to 18 months. Lymphoreticular changes included hyperplasia, follicular involution and depletion, and one animal had amyloidosis of the spleen. Hyperplastic changes also took place in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and infiltrations occurred in the vaginal mucosa of one animal, which could be significant in sexual transmission of the infection. The range of opportunistic infections was small compared with that in human AIDS patients, although two monkeys had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Enterocolitis was a common finding and brown adipose tissue was transformed into a large vacuolated type. Lesions of the central nervous system were found in five of nine monkeys, and consisted of foci of glial activity and perivascular and meningeal lymphocytic infiltration. A lymphoma involving the lumbar spinal cord developed in one animal.</p>

<p>Joint pain has been associated with fatty infiltration of the knee articulation. The purpose of this study is to report on the histopathological findings, especially fatty changes, that are seen in surgical specimens from the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) of patients that had persistent pain after non-surgical therapy. Forty plicated TMJ retrodiscal samples from 25 patients were used in this study. The patients were previously treated with splints for variable periods but not less than 2 months. The specimens were obtained by 2 surgeons using standard TMJ plication techniques. Control disc specimens were obtained from normal appearing cadaveric TM joints. Samples were immediately immersed in glutaraldehyde and processed for light and electron microscopic examination. The specimens were composed mainly of moderately dense tissue with cells that appeared fibroblastic and intermittent chondrocytic type cells. Fatty change, exclusively in association with the perivascular areas, was observed in 27 of 40 specimens. Electron microscopy showed fibroblasts, as well as large fat inclusions adjacent to elastin macroglobules. Fatty infiltration of the TMJ has been interpreted as a degenerative change. It is postulated that kinins and prostaglandins generated in the fat pads can pass freely in tissue fluid to adjacent, highly innervated structures thus leading to joint pain. It is further postulated that the finding of associated elastin with fatty deposition is similar to the atherosclerotic changes encountered in large blood vessels and the aorta.</p>

<p>Bone marrow examinations were performed on 20 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 39 with AIDS-related complex (ARC). Fever of unknown origin and thrombocytopenia were common in ARC, but anemia and leukopenia were most frequent in AIDS. Changes in stromal cells and perivascular cuffing of plasma cells were found significantly more often in patients with AIDS than in those with ARC. Malignancies were common in both groups. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nucleic acids were detected with the use of a 3H-labeled cDNA probe with an in situ hybridization method in 11 bone marrow samples (three ARC and eight AIDS). Most commonly positive cells were mononucleated, resembling lymphocytes and histiocytes. Endothelial cells, interdigitating reticulum cells, nucleated red blood cells, and immature myeloid cells also had positive results in some instances. The number of HIV-positive cells was not related to the size of the bone biopsies or the clinical diagnoses. The authors postulate that changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of these patients may be related to latent persistent infection with HIV.</p>

<p>The histopathologic features in four cases of subcutaneous xanthogranuloma were reviewed. All patients were elderly men and no associated diseases or hyperlipidemia were present. The microscopic picture was uniform in seven biopsy specimens: foam cells and masses circumscribed by Touton cells replacing the adipose tissue. Most cells, including foam cells, showed a positive reaction for the macrophage marker MAC387. Diffuse, sparse T cells and focal perivascular B cell nodules were identified. Electron microscopic examination showed histiocytes and lysosome-rich cells with myelin bodies. All patients are alive and well. We believe that we have identified a form of adult subcutaneous xanthogranuloma syndrome that can be initially confusing and lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</p>

<p>Both rat adrenal and lung contain low levels of angiotensinogen mRNA, as shown by Northern blot and nuclease S1 analyses of RNA extracted from these tissues. We sought to identify the cellular localization of angiotensinogen mRNA in these two tissues using hybridization in situ of tissues obtained from both control rats and rats administered a combination of dexamethasone, ethynylestradiol, and T3. For the adrenal of hormone-treated rats, angiotensinogen mRNA was identified in periadrenal fibroblast-like cells and brown adipose tissue. For control rats, positive hybridization was obtained for fibroblast-like cells immediately adjacent to the adrenal capsule, but not for periadrenal brown adipose tissue. No hybridization was obtained for cells of the adrenal cortex, medulla, capsule or vessels. For the lung of hormone treated, but not control rats, angiotensinogen mRNA was identified in perivascular and peribronchial fibroblast-like cells and brown adipose tissue in the lung hilum. No hybridization was obtained for pulmonary parenchyma, bronchi, or vessels. These results confirm the widespread tissue distribution of angiotensinogen mRNA, and provide further evidence for the formation of angiotensin within tissues by mechanisms independent of the circulating renin-angiotensin system.</p>

<p>Obliteration of the fat plane surrounding the superior mesenteric artery has been described as characteristic of pancreatic carcinoma. To determine the specificity of this and other computed tomography findings in the pancreas and peripancreatic region, scans of 86 patients were reviewed without clinical history. Diagnoses included pancreatitis (26 patients); pancreatic adenocarcinoma (14 patients); lymphoma (17 patients); metastatic nonpancreatic carcinoma (14 patients); and normal findings (15 patients). Confluent adenopathy could not be reliably differentiated from a pancreatic mass except when adenopathy separated the common bile duct from the duodenum. Retrocrural adenopathy was unusual with pancreatic carcinoma. The fat plane surrounding the superior mesenteric artery was obliterated with pancreatic carcinoma (36%), nonpancreatic carcinoma (29%), and lymphoma (24%), but not with pancreatitis, although perivascular edema was seen in 19%. Evaluation of the celiac axis was less rewarding. Obliteration of the superior mesenteric artery fat plane is a sign of malignancy, but it is not specific for pancreatic carcinoma. We propose that the superior mesenteric artery origin be considered within a paraaortic space, separate from the anterior pararenal space. This explains its characteristic lack of involvement by pancreatitis.</p>

<p>The Parsons Visual Acuity Test (PVAT) is a non-verbal picture based visual acuity test designed for the difficult-to-test preschool child, school age child and adult with handicapping conditions. It is designed primarily for vision screening of the exceptional child and adult with special needs. Since visual acuity measures are quite important in these populations, a comparative study between the PVAT and standard Snellen acuity were designed and completed. There was no significant difference in acuity measures at near, however, the validity of the distance PVAT visual acuity measure was not supported in this study. Implications of the findings and cautions for the use of this test in screening and clinical situations for exceptional children and adults are discussed.</p>

<p>White adipocyte differentiation was studied ultrastructurally in the mouse mammary gland following stimulation with 17beta-estradiol and relaxin. These hormones have been previously demonstrated by us to induce hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the adipose cells of the mouse mammary gland. Following hormone treatment new fat cells are formed around the growing ducts. In these sites there is a close relationship between blood vessel growth and adipocyte development, and stromal areas featuring embryonic fat organs can frequently be found. In the sites of adipocyte differentiation the most numerous cell types are undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and preadipocytes, while fibroblasts and macrophages are much less common. No endothelial cells or pericytes were found detaching from the blood capillary walls. There were no fibroblasts or macrophages containing intracellular lipid deposits. Actively degranulating mast cells were frequent. The above findings strongly suggest the direct origin of adipocytes from perivascular mesenchymal cells, without the intermediate stages of well-differentiated fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells or pericytes. The earliest morphologically recognizable stage in adipocyte differentiation is a ‘pale preadipocyte’, characterized by its irregular shape due to cytoplasmic processes, clear cytoplasmic matrix, well-developed organelles (especially ribosomes and Golgi apparatus), few and small lipid droplets, numerous pinocytotic vesicles and a very thin basal lamina. The next stage in adipocyte differentiation is a ‘dark preadipocyte’ showing a denser cytoplasmic matrix, reduced organelles and more abundant lipid accumulations. The pinocytotic vesicles are very numerous and the enveloping basal lamina is still thin. The subsequent maturation stages are the well-known globular multivacuolated adipocyte and finally the mature univacuolated, signet-ring, white adipocyte.</p>

<p>By using immunohistochemistry it is shown that both the parenchymal and vascular sympathetic innervation in the interscapular depot of brown adipose tissue in the rat contain the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH). In contrast, ‘neuropeptide tyrosine’ (NPY) is selectively present in the vascular sympathetic nerves of the tissue–but not in nerves around brown fat cells. This is consistent with the presence of two populations of neurons (containing either TH alone or TH plus NPY) in the stellate ganglion, which is the probable origin of the sympathetic nerves in the interscapular brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, the perivascular NPY-positive nerves in the brown adipose tissue disappeared after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment, demonstrating their noradrenergic nature. Taken together, these findings suggest that sympathetic nerves to blood vessels and brown fat cells represent two separate subpopulations of autonomic neurons.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty-six thymuses completely removed at autopsy from persons suffering a sudden death were examined by stereological and morphometrical methods. Adding biopsy material from immunologically healthy cardiac patients we obtained relative volumes from 204 persons ranging in age from 1 month to 107 years. The size of the human thymus remains unchanged during ageing under normal physiological conditions (median: 19.5 cm3). Individual maximum size (range: 5-70 cm3) is reached in the first year of life. Early histological changes are in the enlargement of the perivascular space, the Hassall’s bodies, and the connective tissue. This begins in the first year of life, reaches a maximum from 10 to 25 years, then declines again. Adipose tissue replaces the lymphocytic perivascular space and the connective tissue only. This occurs extensively after the age of 15 years. When defined by the silver impregnation technique, the volumes of the thymic epithelium (cortex and medulla), show a continuous involution from the first year to the end of life. The curve can be approximated to simple negative logarithmic functions. The velocity and nature of involution of the thymic epithelium do not change under the influence of the changing hormonal balance due to puberty. Since important thymic functions (T lymphopoiesis and T-cell differentiation) are located in the epithelial space, the age-related involution of the human thymus is not related to puberty.</p>

Using this method, we were able to obtain a visual acuity threshold in 44% of 18- to 24-month-old children and in 90% of children aged 25 to 36 months. At all ages tested, the mode for visual acuity was 20/30; however, the percentage of those with 20/20 increased with age.

<p>Membranous lipodystrophy (Nasu) is characterized by polycystic osteodysplasia associated with dementia. We recently experienced a 9th autopsy case in Japan. This 50 year-old male, eldest in the reported autopsied case in Japan, presented bone fracture at 35 year of age and dementia started at 45. His parents were cousins. His sister, died with carcinoma of the bladder at 35, developed marked osteoporosis with multiple pathological fractures and “membrano-cystic” lesions were found in her adipose tissue. The roentgenogram of the patient’s long bone revealed radiolucent and cystic areas with irregular boundaries at the metaphyses. Computer tomography of the brain examined during the last 3 years showed slowly progressive brain atrophy. Calcifications of the basal ganglia or low density area in the white matter were not found. Autopsy showed typical “membrano-cystic” lesions in the adipose tissue of the whole body including bone marrow. Brain weighed 1,030 g. There was a mild convolutional atrophy at the frontal lobe. White matter was diffusely atrophic. Demyelination was limited to the frontal lobe, where only small number of perivascular sudanophilic lipid-laden macrophages were found. Fibrillary astrocytes were rather diffusely proliferated, consistent with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy. Many spheroids were found in the frontal and occipital deep white matters, and external capsule. Ultrastructural study of spheroid revealed increased amount of neurofilament, vesicles with free patchy dense materials and degenerated mitochondria, which were consistent with primary axonal degeneration.</p>

<p>The distribution of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was studied in needle biopsies of human adipose tissue. Antibodies against bovine milk LPL react with and inhibit the activity of the human enzyme. These antibodies were used for immunohistochemical studies of the distribution of LPL in human adipose tissue. Immunoreactive enzyme was observed in adipocytes and connective tissue cells resembling preadipocytes. It was also seen in perivascular cells, in capillaries and in larger vessels. Intravenous administration of heparin led to a substantial decrease of immunodetectable LPL in vessels, whereas the enzyme in adipocytes and connective tissue cells was unaffected.</p>

We saw a case that was unusual because the nodules present arose in the patient’s fifth decade of life and were confined to the abdominal wall. Histopathologic examination of the nodules showed mature adipose tissue, perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, and numerous mast cells. By electron microscopy, we observed small mature lipocytes within the perivascular mononuclear infiltrates. However, neither lipoblasts nor the transition of mesenchymal cells to lipocytes could be demonstrated.</p>

<p>Lower limbs of human adults, males and females, were used for micro- and mesoscopic studies of the collagen-elastic arrangement of the tissue surrounding the femoral vessels on their course along the adductor canal. The vessels’ sheaths and lamellae which join them to the canal walls, are formed by strong networks of collagen and elastic fibers, and the perivascular area is filled by thin lamellae of connective tissue, delimiting lobules of adipose tissue. The functional importance of this arrangement to the mechanic protection of the vessels during contraction of the muscles related to the vessels in the adductor canal is discussed.</p>

<p>A scanning electron microscopic technique for the examination of bulk, fresh, hydrated human tissue is described. Samples of fresh tissue are frozen in liquid nitrogen against a mirror-finished copper block and planed in a cryoultramicrotome before transfer to a low temperature scanning electron microscope. After sublimation of water from the specimen surface, the tissue is examined in secondary electron and backscattered electron modes. Adjacent pieces of tissue, and those retrieved after backscattered electron observation, can be readily prepared for and examined by light and by conventional transmission electron microscopy. The method has been tested with multiple blocks taken from 6 cases of human breast carcinoma. In the backscattered electron mode, the infiltrating columns of neoplastic cells can be distinguished from mammary adipose and fibrous tissue. Within a carcinoma, the collagenous stroma, carcinoma cells, and perivascular and perineural infiltrates can be identified. These features have been contrasted with those obtained by light microscopy, by low temperature scanning, and by transmission electron microscopy. This use of backscattered electron imaging for the investigation of unfixed hydrated tissue offers the possibility that the technique could be of considerable value in the microscopy of very small samples in which, because of a need for subsequent biochemical, histochemical, and immunologic investigation, fixation and dehydration are to be avoided.</p>

<p>Our investigations have shown that depletion of brown fat is prevented by its complete denervation. The cutting off either the spinal nerves or the perivascular nerves only leads to a partial depletion. From this we conclude that the brown fat is innervated via these two nerve paths. The depletion of brown fat is accompanied by the development of different cell types that are described as different stages of this process. The investigations eliminate the possibility that brown fat may change into white fat.</p>

<p>Histochemical and ultrastructural aspects of adipocyte differentiation in subcutaneous tissue of fetal pigs were analyzed in a longitudinal study. A matrix of collagen fibers surrounding adipocytes developed after the establishment of a distinct and continuous PAS-positive basement membrane. The degree of plasma membrane invagination and specialization was positively correlated with the extent of basement membrane and collagen matrix formation. Close spatial relationships between narrow, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane invaginations, the surface of lipid droplets and mitochondria were observed in differentiating adipocytes. Histochemical and ultrastructural criteria for the identification of preadipocytes are: (1) perivascular location; (2) mitochondria localized in the Golgi zone; (3) cytosolic glycogen; (4) rough endoplasmic reticulum with cisternae uniformly and approximately 600 A wide; (5) free ribosomes and few polysomes, and (6) lipid droplets encased by microfilaments. These criteria permitted clear distinction from obvious fibroblasts and macrophages. Other stromal cells were morphologically abnormal. Occasionally, adipocytes and perivascular cells exhibited close intercellular contacts that were morphologically distinct from intercellular contacts between contiguous endothelial cells.</p>

<p>In current phlebological practice nodular vasculitic lesions are described as being characterised by hypodermal perivascular inflammation. The aetiology is diverse: in this article hypodermatitis of varicose and postphlebitic origin, both of which are due to basic vein disorders and which are certainly the most often encountered phlebopathies in daily practice, are studied and then there is a further study of acute and sub-acute nodular hypodermatitis which in practice represents a differential diagnosis to the former but are less frequently encountered. Finally, other cases of hypodematitis due to yet more rare causes are recalled. Rare though these may be, the practicing physician must not fail to consider them when a patient who has come to see him presents with suspect nodular lesions of the lower limbs.</p>

<p>The ultrastructure of 10 myxoid liposarcomas from 9 patients is presented. Features closely resembling those of developing fetal adipose tissue were seen in all tumors. THe various cell types identified ranged from undifferentiated cells to typical multivacuolated and univacuolated lipoblasts. In addition, a secretory type mesenchymal cell with distended cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum was found in every case as well as intermediate cells with secretory product and lipid accumulation. relative proportions of these types varied from case to case. A prominent feature in all cases was the particular spatial relationship of the abundant capillaries to the various cell types. The undifferentiated cells had perivascular processes with a tendency to envelop the primitive capillaries. These cells progressively enlarged and acquired features of the differentiated cell types as they separated from the lamina. Mitotic activity, when detectable, was prominent in the capillary wall and its vicinity. Lipoblasts resembling those of brown adipose tissue frequently coexisted in the same tumor with others analogous to those of white adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that tumor cells in liposarcoma originate from a dividing population of perivascular mesenchymal cells, in a manner akin to that of developing white adipose tissue.</p>

<p>Leukoencephalopathic alteration in a case of membranous lipodystrophy which involves the systemic adipose tissue has been described. A 44-year-old Japanese man whose parents were consanguinous developed multiple cystic lesions in the limb bones with a pathological fracture, followed by progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and died 16 years after the onset of his illness. Brain showed diffuse and symmetrical demyelination of the cerebral white matter, particularly in the fronto-temporal lbes, with preservation of subcortical arcuate fibers, associated with the occurrence of sudanophilic granules within perivascular macrophages and conspicuous fibrous gliosis. The alteration suggests it to be a sudanophilic leukodystrophy. Deposition of calcospherites in the basal ganglia was another interesting remark. This disorder is thought to be associated with an impairment in systemic lipid metabolism affecting both cerebral myelin and fat cell membranes on a heredofamilial background.</p>

<p>In order to clarify the relationships between perivascular cells, capillaries and fat cells, with a special reference to the origin of fat cells, we have made a light and electron microscopical study on the developing epididymal adipose tissue of newborn to 5-week-old rats, and also on the differentiating, transplanted epididymal preadipose tissue from 6-day-old rats. Development of epididymal preadipose tissue progressed rapidly 6 or 7 days after birth. The preadipose tissue on the 5th day after transplantation consisted of differentiated areas with many mature fat cells, and of undifferentiated areas in which these cells were scanty. In the differentiated areas of developing epididymal preadipose tissue, both in situ and transplanted, many fat cells seemed to develop in the area immediately adjacent to growing capillaries, but cells intermediate between perivascular cells and preadipocytes were seldom observed. However, in undifferentiated areas of transplanted tissue, we found ultrastructural evidence that immature pericytes of capillaries can differentiate into preadipocytes.</p>

<p>A 53-year-old woman developed swelling of her hands after strenuous sport. Soon her feet became affected and the swelling spread up the arms and legs making arm movement and walking difficult. No Raynaud’s phenomenon appeared or other features of systemic sclerosis. There was eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinaemia in the peripheral blood. Histological examination of the skin showed an increase in the collagen bundles in the dermis extending down to the adipose tissue. The fascia showed dense fibrous tissue with a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, a few plasma cells and eosinophils. Immunohistology of the skin and fascia were negative for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, CIq and fibrin. After 4 weeks of prednisolone 40 mg daily there was a great improvement. This continued with further corticosteroid therapy.</p>

<p>The collagen in localized and systemic scleroderma skin was studied by light microscopy with silver impregnation (50 patients), electron microscopy (14 patients), and immunofluorescence microscopy using specific antibodies against Type I and Type III collagens (12 patients). In the cellular stage, the dermis and adipose tissue revealed perivascular or diffuse cellular infiltrates (mostly lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages), accompanied by deposition of Type III collagen. The lower dermis also showed an increase in Type III collagen. In the fibrotic stage, the papillary layer showed a reduction and/or clumping of Type III collagen as compared to normal skin. The lower dermis and the adipose tissue revealed compact collagen consisting exclusively of Type I collagen or a mixture of Type I and Type III collagen. The pattern of Type III collagen distribution was similar to that of reticulin, thus suggesting that at least some reticulin fibrils may represent Type III collagen.</p>

<p>Eight cases of angiomyolipoma of the kidneys were studied. A variant of the tumour in which its vascular component consisted mostly of numerous primitive vascular fissures penetrating the smooth muscle tissue is described. In two cases, perivascular outgrowths of undifferentiated cells of apparently adventitial type were found. In most cases the mature fatty tissue of the tumour is found to have large multinucleate cells assume to be a manifestation of atypical differentiation of precursors of fatty cells. The smooth muscle tissue can be of a various degrees of maturity, and variants of angiomyolipoma may be distinguished in which the muscular component is represented either by highly a differentiated tissue, or by a immature tissue or combination of both.</p>
